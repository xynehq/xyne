## üìå What is Xyne 
Xyne is an Al-first Search & Answer Engine for work. We're an
OSS alternative to Glean, Gemini and MS Copilot.
Your work information has become fragmented across so many
SaaS apps, docs, files, repos, projects, issues, emails,
messages, tickets, etc. Xyne connects to your applications like
Google Workspace, Atlassian suite, Slack, Github, etc and
securely indexes your data. So you get a (Google + ChatGPT)
like experience to find anything across it all and get up-to-date
answers with sources.
Find that file, triage that issue, ask everything about a
customer / deal / feature, discover the right people.


You can check out our [documentation](https://xyne.mintlify.app/introduction) to lean more about Xyne.
