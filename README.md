## üìå What is Xyne 
![Xyne App](docs/readme/Xyne-Readme.png)

Your work information has become fragmented across so many
SaaS apps, docs, files, repos, projects, issues, emails,
messages, tickets, etc. Xyne connects to your applications like
Google Workspace, Atlassian suite, Slack, Github, etc and
securely indexes your data. So you get a (Google + ChatGPT)
like experience to find anything across it all and get up-to-date
answers with sources.
Find that file, triage that issue, ask everything about a
customer / deal / feature, discover the right people.
