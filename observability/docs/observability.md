## Steps to run the metrics dashboard

To run the metrics, from the root folder run this command in the terminal 
```sh
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.metrics.yml up
``` 

### Ensure Prometheus is up and running
 To ensure **Prometheus** is up and running 
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:9090/`.
   - If Prometheus is running correctly you'll land in the dashboard.
   - Then Navigate to Status > Targets.
   - This will take to the list of targets from which metrics is getting scraped. In our case you should see `xyne-data-ingest` table having an `up` state. 
   - This confirms that prometheus is able to scrape vespa's data correctly.


### Set-up Grafana metrics

To set up **Grafana** dashboad :
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3002/` in your browser.
- To log in use the default username and password (admin)
- Once you see the dashboard, Navigate to Connections using the Nav bar to the left.
- Under Connections you will find a tab for `Data Sources`. Navigate to that and look for `Prometheus`.
- In the `Settings` section of the Prometheus Data Source,  paste the connection URL `http://xyne-prometheus:9090`. This is URL for the prometheus instance running in docker. Also ensure that the `name` property is set to `prometheusSource`, if it isn't already present.
- Now scroll down to Save and Test your connection. It should show a `Successful` message.
- Now using the same Nav bar to the left, navigate to `Dashboards`.
- Once on the dashboard page you will see the `New` button in the top right corner. Click on that button and select the `import` option.
- Now in the import section, either upload or paste the `grafana-metrics.json` file in the setup folder of this directory.
- Click on load and then import.
- You should now have the dashboard imported successfully. Navigate back to the Dashboard section and you should see the `Xyne Metrics` dashboard up.
- Initially you will have to: 
    - Click on the dashboard.
    - Hover on the panel and click on the menu (the three dots to the top-right of the panel), and click edit.
    - In the `Queries` tab select the **prometheus** datasource which you've just added.
    - Click on `Run Queries` to get the results.
    - Follow the same steps for the rest of the panels.
