Xyne is an AI-first Search & Answer Engine for work. We’re an OSS alternative to Glean, Gemini and MS Copilot.

Your work information has become fragmented — across so many SaaS apps, docs, files, repos, projects, issues, emails, messages, tickets, etc. Xyne connects to your applications (Google Workspace, Atlassian suite, Slack, Github, etc), securely indexes your data, and maps a graph of relationships. So you get a (Google + ChatGPT) like experience to find anything across it all and get up-to-date answers with sources. 

Find that file, triage that issue, ask everything about a customer / deal / feature / ticket, discover the right people. I.e. Get the right information quickly to move your work forward.
