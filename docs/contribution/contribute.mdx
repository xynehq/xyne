# Option 1 : Asking Xyne to add the feature you're looking for :
You can reach out to us on our [slack community](https://xynerds.slack.com/) in the ```#contribute``` channel, where we'll help you out with adding support for the feature you're looking for.


# Option 2 : Fork the repository and run the project in development mode : 

You can also feel free to make a contribution to the project yourself. Follow the steps below to get started : 

## Step 1: Forking and setting up the repository. 

- The first step is to ```fork``` the repository.

- Following that you need to run the project in ```development``` mode, follow the instruction below :

  href="/contribution/devmode"
>
Run the Xyne app locally in development mode
</Card>

## Step 2 : Make your share of contribution to the project.

You can make a contribution to the project in two ways : 

### Contributing to an open issue on Github : 
You can pick up any issue out of the list of [open issues](https://github.com/xynehq/xyne/issues) on Xyne's Github and contribute to that.

### Contributing to Xyne independently : 
If you have found an issue which is not in the list of [open issues](https://github.com/xyne/issues) on Xyne's Github, you can [create a new issue](https://github.com/xynehq/xyne/issues/new?template=Blank+issue). And then contribute to that.


## Step 3 : Create a PR for the contribution.
Once you've made the code changes, you can create a new PR for the contribution. Follow the sample ``closed`` [PR](https://github.com/xynehq/xyne/pull/238) to see the template for the new PR.

## Step 4 : Wait for the PR to get approved :

At this point your part of the contribution has been done. Wait for the PR to get approved by the authors of Xyne.
