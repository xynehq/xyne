title: Running the application in development mode
---

If you want to run the Xyne application in dev mode, this guide will help you do so

Deployment of Xyne on Local Machine requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Vespa CLI](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/build-install-vespa.html)
- [ PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

 Set-Up Xyne Locally in Dev Mode
---
To Set-Up Xyne, follow the steps listed below :

### Clone the Xyne Repository : 

Run the following command to clone the repository :
```javascript
git clone https://github.com/xynehq/xyne.git
    ```

### Setup Environment variables: 
The application is dependent on some environment variables that you will need to set up.

Inside the ```server``` folder, create a ```.env``` file using :
```javascript
touch .env
```
In the ```.env``` file, you can paste the following :

```javascript .env file
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY>
# If you wish to execute authorization using Service Account then use :
 SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY> 
# If you wish to execute authorization using Oauth then use :   
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET>
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/v1/auth/callback
POST_OAUTH_REDIRECT=http://localhost:5173/
JWT_SECRET=<YOUR_JWT_SECRET>
DATABASE_HOST=xyne-db
VESPA_HOST=vespa
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY>
HOST=<YOUR_HOST>
```

### Set up Docker

Set up docker by running the follow command : 

```javascript
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.dev.yml up
```
Running this command will host vespa and postgres containers inside your docker.

# Set permission to run the init-script
 We first need to set the executable permission to run the init-script, for that, run the following command : 
 ```javascript
sudo chmod +x init-script.sh [ For Mac OS and Unix ]

OR 

icacls init-script.sh /grant Everyone:F [If using PowerShell in Windows]


```

### Run the init-script to initialize the application

Navigate to the server folder using ```cd server``` and run the following commands : 

```javascript
./init-script.sh
```
This will initialise all the dependencies required by the server to run the application successfully, 
and will also start the server, which will be listening on port ```3000```.

### Start the Xyne client
To start the client side, navigate to the ```frontend``` folder : 

#### Client side .env

Create a new ```.env ``` in the ```frontend``` folder, use the following command : 
```javascript
touch .env
```
Now paste the following inside the ```.env``` file : 

```javascript
 VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
 VITE_WS_BASE_URL=wss://localhost:3000
```
Save the file.

```javascript
bun install
```
This installs all dependencies required by the client side to run.

Then start the client using the command : 

```javascript
bun run dev
```

The app will now be available in port ```5173```.  [Go to Xyne](http://localhost:5173/)
