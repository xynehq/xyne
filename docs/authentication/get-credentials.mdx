- Navigate to the Credentials Section in the sidebar, and click on  ```+CREATE CREDENTIALS ```. It will ask you to create oauth consent screen, for this you can refer to [the consent screen](https://docs.xynehq.com/authentication/oauth#setting-up-the-oauth-consent-screen). 
For now in the scope section only add ```/auth/userinfo.email```,```/auth/userinfo.profile``` and ```openid```, leave out the rest of it.

- Add Authorized redirect URIs as:
    - ```http://localhost:3001/v1/auth/callback``` for local setup or ```https://<YOUR_AWS_EC2_IPv4_DNS>/v1/auth/callback``` for production.
    - ```http://localhost:3001/oauth/callback``` for local setup or ```https://<YOUR_AWS_EC2_IPv4_DNS>/oauth/callback``` for production.

<Note> Use ```http://localhost:3000/v1/auth/callback``` and ```http://localhost:3000/oauth/callback``` when using devmode.</Note>

Click ```CREATE``` and make sure to save the Client ID and Client Secret for putting it in the [```.env``` of the application](https://docs.xynehq.com/quickstart#server-side)
