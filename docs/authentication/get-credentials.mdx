Follow the instructions below to generate your google credentials : 

## Setting up a project in Google Cloud Console
Create a new project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)

Switch to the new project you just created.

## Setting up the OAuth Credentials
Under APIs and Services section in the menu on the sidebar, click on ```Credentials```,

- Navigate to the Credentials Section in the sidebar, and click on  ```+CREATE CREDENTIALS ```. It will ask you to create oauth consent screen, for this you can refer to [the consent screen](https://xyne.mintlify.app/authentication/oauth#setting-up-the-oauth-consent-screen). 

<Tip> For now just create a basic consent screen, you'll be setting up the scopes later during ingestion. You won't be able to set scopes now because you haven't enabled any of the required APIs yet.</Tip>

- Under that select the ```OAuth client ID``` option.

- Add the type as ```Web Application```, and give it a name (For ex: Xyne)
<img height="200" src="../images/oauth-6.png" />

- Add Authorized JavaScript origins as:
    - ```http://localhost:3001``` for local or replace with ```http://<YOUR_AWS_EC2_IPv4_DNS>``` for production.

- Add Authorized redirect URIs as:
    - ```http://localhost:3001/v1/auth/callback``` for local setup or ```https://<YOUR_AWS_EC2_IPv4_DNS>/v1/auth/callback``` for production.
    - ```http://localhost:3001/oauth/callback``` for local setup or ```https://<YOUR_AWS_EC2_IPv4_DNS>/oauth/callback``` for production.

<Note> Use ```http://localhost:3000/v1/auth/callback``` and ```http://localhost:3000/oauth/callback``` when using devmode.</Note>

Click ```CREATE``` and make sure to save the Client ID and Client Secret for putting it in the [```.env``` of the application](https://xyne.mintlify.app/quickstart#post-execution-steup-environment-variables)
