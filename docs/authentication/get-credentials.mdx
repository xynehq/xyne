Switch to the new project you just created.

## Setting up the Oauth Consent Screen: 

<Tip> For a completely new project you will need to setup the consent screen before setting the credentials.</Tip>

First step after creating the project is to setup the OAuth Consent Screen. 
- For this navigate to the OAuth Consent Screen in the Sidebar of your Google Cloud Console : 

<img height="200" src="../images/oauth-2.png" />

- Under the Oauth Overview screen, click on ```Get Started``` button. 
<img height="200" src="../images/gtstrtd.png" />

- Under the ```App Information``` Section, fill out the details :
    - Provide a Name for the app (For ex: Xyne)
    - Provide a User Support email (For ex: your-email@gmail.com)

 <img height="200" src="../images/appinfo.png" />

 - Click on ```NEXT```.

- Under ```Audience``` section select ```Internal``` : 
<img height="200" src="../images/oauth-int.png" />
<Tip> If you're using personal email, you can choose ```External```.</Tip>

- Click on ```NEXT```.

- Under ```Contact Information``` give the developer email. (For ex: your-contact@gmail.com)
<img height="200" src="../images/oauth-email.png" />
- Click on ```NEXT```.

- Under the ```Finish``` section click on the checkbox to accept Google's User Data Policy. 
<img height="200" src="../images/oauth-acpt-dtp.png" />
- Click on ```CONTINUE```.

- Click on ```CREATE```.

<Tip>If you had previously chosen ```External``` in your ```Audience``` section, you can now navigate to ```Audience``` section again  in the side menu and add your allowed external users in the ```Test Users``` section. </Tip>

#### Setting Scopes : 
- Now navigate to the ```Data Access``` section on the left-side menu.
<img height="200" src="../images/dtacc.png" />
- Under the ```Scopes``` section you'll see the ```Add or Remove Scopes``` button. Click on that: 
<img height="200" src="../images/oauth-scopes.png" />
<Tip> If you're going for OAuth Authentication you can set all the scopes using this part of the [OAuth Authentication Guide](https://docs.xynehq.com/authentication/oauth#adding-the-scopes-for-the-enabled-apis). 
If not you can add the scopes mentioned below. </Tip>
- For now in the scope section only add ```/auth/userinfo.email```,```/auth/userinfo.profile``` and ```openid```, leave out the rest of it.

- Click on ```Save```.

This concludes the setting-up of your OAuth Consent Screen


## Setting up the OAuth Credentials
- Now, under ```Clients``` section in the menu on the sidebar, 

<img height="200" src="../images/clients.png" />

- Click on ```+CREATE CLIENT```,

- Under that you will see ```Create OAuth client ID``` option. 
<img height="200" src="../images/cocid.png" />

- Add the type as ```Web Application```, and give it a name (For ex: Xyne)
<img height="200" src="../images/oauth-6.png" />

- Add Authorized JavaScript origins as:
    - ```http://localhost:3001``` for local or replace with ```http://<YOUR_AWS_EC2_IPv4_DNS>``` for production.

- Add Authorized redirect URIs as:
    - ```http://localhost:3001/v1/auth/callback``` for local setup or ```https://<YOUR_AWS_EC2_IPv4_DNS>/v1/auth/callback``` for production.
    - ```http://localhost:3001/oauth/callback``` for local setup or ```https://<YOUR_AWS_EC2_IPv4_DNS>/oauth/callback``` for production.

<Note> Use ```http://localhost:3000``` as authorized Javascript Origins. Use ```http://localhost:3000/v1/auth/callback``` and ```http://localhost:3000/oauth/callback``` when using dev-mode.</Note>

Click ```CREATE``` and make sure to save the Client ID and Client Secret for putting it in the [```.env``` of the application](https://docs.xynehq.com/quickstart#setting-the-environment-variables)


<Tip> With this you will now be able to successfully login to Xyne with your google account.</Tip>
