- Remember the ```Client id``` associated with this json file.
- Once the key file has been created, choose a reliable location for downloading the key file, this will be used for putting it in the [```.env``` of the application](https://docs.xynehq.com/quickstart#setting-the-environment-variables)


## Enabling APIs
Switch to the new project you just created.

The first step is to enable the APIs which are needed for the app.
- From the menu in the Sidebar, under APIs and Services section select the ```Enabled APIs & Services```.
<img height="200" src="../images/enable-apis1.png" />
- In the ```Enabled APIs & Services``` page, click on the ```+ Enable APIs & Services```.
<img height="200" src="../images/enable-apis2.png" />
- You will now see a search box where you can search for the specific API that you want to enable. (For example :  Google Drive API)
<img height="200" src="../images/enable-apis3.png" />
- Once you search for an API, you will find a list of APIs. 
<img height="200" src="../images/enable-apis4.png" />
- From the list of APIs, select the Google Drive API to enable. And then click on ```Enable``` in the API page.
<img height="200" src="../images/enable-apis5.png" />
- Once the API is enabled, you will see that the Enable button now changes to ```Manage```. This means that the API has been enabled.
<img height="200" src="../images/enable-apis6.png" />
- When you go back to the ```Enabled APIs & Services``` page, you will see that the enabled API has appeared in the list.
<img height="200" src="../images/enable-apis7.png" />

Following the same steps above, enable the following APIs : 
 - [Google Drive](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com)
 - [Google Calendar](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com)

 - [People](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/people.googleapis.com)
-  [Admin SDK](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/admin.googleapis.com)

<Warning> Please make sure to **enable all** the APIs listed above to ensure the Xyne app runs smoothly. </Warning>
