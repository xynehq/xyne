<Note>This is a detailed guide to help you re-ingest your data into the Xyne app, whether it's using the OAuth account or Service Account.</Note>

Incase you have restarted the app or simply want to re-ingest your data into the Xyne app, you can use the following steps to do so : 

<Info> This guide is a temporary solution to help you re-ingest your data into the Xyne app, we will soon be creating a UI for it for easier use </Info>

## Steps to Re-Ingest Data into the Xyne app:

<Warning> Make sure the docker containers are ***running***, this is required for the following changes you'll make.</Warning>

- First we need to bash into the docker container running the database, i.e., ```xyne-db```. For this use :
    ```javascript
    docker exec -it xyne-db bash
    ```

- This will take you inside the docker container. You will see that you're logged-in as a ```root``` user and also see the ```container id``` with it.

- This means you're now inside the docker container successfully, after this you need to login to the postgres database as a xyne user. 

-  For this, use the following command :
    ```javascript
    psql -U xyne
    ```

- Once you've logged in to the postgres database as a Xyne user, you will see this :
    <img height="200" src="../images/postpsql.png" />

- Next, you wanna see the list of tables in the database, use : 
    ```javascript
    \d
    ```
- This will show you the list of tables in the postgres database, out of the tables, we will be working with ```connectors``` and ```oauth_providers```, ```sync_jobs``` and also ```sync_history```.

- Now we will have a look at the contents of each table using the following commands :
    <Tip>You can use ```q``` to exit viewing the table contents</Tip>

    - Oauth Providers
    ```javascript
    select * from oauth_providers;
    ```
     - Connectors
    ```javascript
    select * from connectors;
    ```

    - Sync Jobs
    ```javascript
    select * from sync_jobs;
    ```

    and

        - Sync History
    ```javascript
    select * from sync_history;
    ```
<Tip> Consider remembering the ```id``` for each table because you might need it later. </Tip>

<Tip>If you don't see an output for any of the above tables, you can refrain from following the next step for that specific table only.</Tip>

- This will show you the contents of the table. 

- Now lets remove the contents of the tables, for this use either:

#### Truncate

    ```javascript
    truncate table connectors, oauth_providers, sync_jobs, sync_history;
    ```
OR [If you face issues with the truncation]

#### Delete 

 - Oauth Providers
    ```javascript
    delete from table oauth_providers where id=;
    ```
     - Connectors
    ```javascript
    delete from table connectors where id= ;
    ```
    - Sync Jobs
    ```javascript
    delete from table sync_jobs where id= ; 
    ```
    and 

    - Sync History
    ```javascript
    delete from table sync_history where id= ;
    ```


- Once this is done, you can ```exit``` out of the db and docker-container using the  command: 

    ```javascript
    exit
    ```

- After doing this, when you revisit your connectors page for ingestion, you will see the form for the account like you initially did when ingesting.
