If you want to deploy Xyne using your local machine, this document will give you a detailed guide to do so.
Follow the steps listed below to get started : 

## Install the required dependencies : 
Deployment of Xyne requires you to only install Docker and Docker Compose:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Once you have installed the dependency, you can use the following steps to set up the app.


## Clone the repository : 

Use the following git command to clone the xyne repository.
```javascript
git clone https://github.com/xynehq/xyne.git
```

## Deploy Xyne with Docker  :

<Tip> Remember to ensure that your Docker service is running. Incase you're using Docker Desktop, ensure that is running too </Tip>

<Tip> If you have postgres running, we suggest you kill the process before starting docker </Tip>

Run the application with the following command from the ```xyne``` folder:
```javascript 
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yml up
```

And that is all 🎉 ! The app will now be available in port ```3001```.  [Go to xyne](http://localhost:3001/)

<Info> Since the size of the downloading models can be quite large, wait for the application to start running, this can take around 10 - 15 minutes, depending on your internet connection. </Info>

### Post Execution Steup [Environment Variables]:

For enabling Google Authentication for your application you need to create your google credentials and setup some environment variables: 

You can obtain the ```GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID``` and ```GOOGLE_SECRET``` by following guide :

Setup your Google Credentials for the application.
</Card>

#### Server side: 
Inside the ```server``` folder of the ```xyne``` folder, you will find a ```.env.temp``` file, this is the .env file that our docker uses.
For the moment you will find some default generated environment variables that we've set up for the app to work.


<Warning> We strictly recommend generating your own ENCRYPTION_KEY, SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY and JWT_SECRET values for security.</Warning>

In the ```.env.temp``` file, you can modify the following and replace the missing values with your own :

```javascript .env.temp file
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY>
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY> 
# If you wish to execute authorization using Oauth then use :   
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET>
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/v1/auth/callback
GOOGLE_PROD_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3001/v1/auth/callback
JWT_SECRET=<YOUR_JWT_SECRET>
DATABASE_HOST=xyne-db
VESPA_HOST=vespa
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY>
AWS_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_SECRET>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY>
HOST=http://localhost:3001
AWS_REGION=<YOUR_AWS_REGION>
```

And build again from the ``xyne`` folder using : 

```javascript 
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yml up 
```

<Note> Cuurently the client side has .env variables that refer to port 3001, if you've changed the port number ensure to change the values in the .env as well. </Note>
