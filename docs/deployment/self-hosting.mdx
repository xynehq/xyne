If you don't want to set-up Xyne to a Cloud Platform, you can easily set-up Xyne to your local machine. Follow the instructions below to  set-up Xyne locally.

Deployment of Xyne on Local Machine requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Vespa CLI](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/build-install-vespa.html)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

 Set-Up Xyne Locally
---
To Set-Up Xyne, follow the steps listed below :

### Clone the Xyne Repository : 

Run the following command to clone the repository :
```javascript
git clone https://github.com/xynehq/xyne.git
    ```

### Setup Environment variables: 
Inside the ```server``` folder, create a ```.env``` file using :
```javascript
touch .env
```
In the ```.env``` file, you can paste the following :

```javascript .env file
NOTION_API_KEY=<YOUR_NOTION_SECRET>
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY>
# If you wish to execute authorization using Service Account then use :
 SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY> 
# If you wish to execute authorization using Oauth then use :   
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET>
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/v1/auth/callback
POST_OAUTH_REDIRECT=http://localhost:5173/
JWT_SECRET=<YOUR_JWT_SECRET>
DATABASE_HOST=xyne-db
VESPA_HOST=vespa
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY>
```

### Set up Docker

Navigate to deployment folder : 
 ```javascript
cd xyne/search/deployment
```
Once inside the deployment folder set up docker by running the follow command : 
```javascript
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.dev.yml up
```
Running this command will host vespa and postgres containers inside your docker.



### Migrate PostgreSQL Schema

Navigate to the server folder using ```cd server``` and run the following commands : 

```javascript
bun install
```
This will install all the dependencies required by the server to run the application successfully.

```javascript
bun run generate
```
```javascript
bun run migrate
```
This will migrate the postgres schema.

###  Set-Up Vespa

Navigate to ```server/vespa``` folder and  set-up vespa : 

<Warning> Ensure ```Vespa CLI``` is installed in the local machine for it to work.</Warning>


```javascript
./deploy.sh
```

### Start the Xyne server

Once vespa has been deployed and the docker is running both Vespa and PostgreSQL containers, it is time to start the Xyne server. To do that, navigate to the ```server``` folder.
Once inside the server folder, run the following command : 

```javascript
bun run dev
```
This will start the server, which will be listening on port ```3000```.

### Start the Xyne client
To start the client side, navigate to the frontend folder using ``` cd frontend``` and run the following command : 

```javascript
bun install
```
This installs all dependencies required by the client side to run.

Then start the client using the command : 

```javascript
bun run dev
```

The app will now be available in port ```5173```.
