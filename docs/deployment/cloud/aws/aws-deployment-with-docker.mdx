<Tip>We recommend using EC2 Instance for the deployment as it is the simplest to set-up.</Tip>

If you want to deploy Xyne on AWS instead of your local machine, this document will give you a detailed guide to do so.
Follow the steps listed below to get started : 

<Note>This guide focuses on deploying the application using docker image only</Note>

## Connect to the instance remotely: 
Once you have your instance up and running, you can use your terminal to connect to your instance remotely. 
Use this command to connect to your instance : 

```javascript
ssh -i ~/path/to/your-private-key-file.pem ec2-user@public-ipv4-address
```


## Install the required dependencies : 
Deployment of Xyne on AWS EC2 using docker image requires you to only install Docker and Docker Compose:


- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Once you have installed the dependency, you can use the following steps to set up the instance.

<Warning>Ensure you have an instance with enough storage to store the dependencies and run the Xyne Application</Warning>


## Clone the repository : 

Use the following git command to clone the Xyne repository.
```javascript
git clone https://github.com/xynehq/Xyne.git
```

## Deploy Xyne with Docker  :

Run the following command to run the application :
```javascript 
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.selfhost.yml up 
```

### Your application is now deployed : 

Your application is now running and will be available in your EC2 Public IPv4 DNS address.


### Post Execution Steup [Environment Variables]:

For enabling Google Authentication for your application you need to create and setup some environment variables: 

#### Server side: 
Inside the ```server``` folder of ```xyne```, create a ```.env``` file using :
```javascript
touch .env
```
In the ```.env``` file, you can paste the following :

```javascript .env file
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY>
# If you wish to execute authorization using Service Account then use :
 SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY> 
# If you wish to execute authorization using Oauth then use :   
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET>
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/v1/auth/callback
GOOGLE_PROD_REDIRECT_URI=<YOUR_Public_IPv4_DNS_ADDRESS>/v1/auth/callback
JWT_SECRET=<YOUR_JWT_SECRET>
DATABASE_HOST=xyne-db
VESPA_HOST=vespa
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY>
AWS_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_SECRET>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY>
HOST=<YOUR_AWS_HOST>

```

#### Client side

Create a new ```.env ``` in the ```frontend``` folder, use the following command : 
```javascript
touch .env
```
Now paste the following inside the ```.env``` file : 

```javascript
 VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://<YOUR_AWS_INSTANCE_IPv4_DNS>
 VITE_WS_BASE_URL=wss://<YOUR_AWS_INSTANCE_IPv4_DNS>
```
Save the file.

Once that's done, navigate back to the ``deployment`` folder you can bring down the docker-compose using : 
```javascript 
docker-compose -f docker-compose.selfhost.yml down
```

And build again using : 

```javascript 
docker-compose -f docker-compose.selfhost.yml up --build
```
