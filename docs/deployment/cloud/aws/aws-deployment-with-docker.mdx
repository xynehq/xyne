<Tip>We recommend using EC2 Instance for the deployment as it is the simplest to set-up.</Tip>

If you want to deploy Xyne on AWS instead of your local machine, this document will give you a detailed guide to do so.
Follow the steps listed below to get started : 

## Connect to the instance remotely: 
Once you have your instance up and running, you can use your terminal to connect to your instance remotely. 
Use this command to connect to your instance : 

```javascript
ssh -i ~/path/to/your-private-key-file.pem ec2-user@public-ipv4-address
```


## Install the required dependencies : 
Deployment of Xyne on AWS EC2 using docker image requires you to only install Docker and Docker Compose:


- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Once you have installed the dependency, you can use the following steps to set up the instance.

<Warning>Ensure you have an instance with enough storage to store the dependencies and run the Xyne Application</Warning>


## Clone the repository : 

Use the following git command to clone the Xyne repository.
```javascript
git clone https://github.com/xynehq/Xyne.git
```

### Pre Execution Steup [Environment Variables]:

For enabling Google Authentication for your application you need to create and setup some environment variables: 

#### Server side: 
Inside the ```server``` folder of the ```Xyne``` folder, you will find a ```.env.temp``` file, this is the .env file that our docker uses.
For the moment you will find some default generated environment variables that we've set up for the app to work.

<Warning> We strictly recommend generating your own ENCRYPTION_KEY, SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY and JWT_SECRET values.</Warning>

In the ```.env.temp``` file, you can modify the following :

```javascript .env.temp file
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY>
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY> 
# If you wish to execute authorization using Oauth then use :   
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET>
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3001/v1/auth/callback
GOOGLE_PROD_REDIRECT_URI=<YOUR_Public_IPv4_DNS_ADDRESS>/v1/auth/callback
JWT_SECRET=<YOUR_JWT_SECRET>
DATABASE_HOST=xyne-db
VESPA_HOST=vespa
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY>
AWS_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_SECRET>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY>
HOST=<YOUR_Public_IPv4_DNS_ADDRESS>
```
<Note> You can obtain the GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_SECRET by following either the [Oauth](https://xyne.mintlify.app/authentication/oauth) or [Service](https://xyne.mintlify.app/authentication/service-accounts) Account authentication section depending on which procedure you choose.</Note>
<Warning> Ensure that these IPv4 address is the same as the you've added in your Google Cloud Project</Warning>

## Deploy Xyne with Docker  :

Run the following command to run the application :
```javascript 
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.selfhost.yml up 
```

### Your application is now deployed : 

Your application is now running and will be available in your EC2 Public IPv4 DNS address.


### Post Execution Setup [ Frontend Environment Variables]
After you have deployed your application, you need to setup some frontend variables for your application.
For this create a ```.env.production``` in your application, and then add the following :

```javascript
 VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://<YOUR_AWS_INSTANCE_IPv4_DNS>
 VITE_WS_BASE_URL=wss://<YOUR_AWS_INSTANCE_IPv4_DNS>
```

<Warning> Ensure that these IPv4 address is the same as the you've added in your Google Cloud Project</Warning>
Save the file.

Now you need to add this to the docker container running the app, for this use :

```javascript
docker cp /path/to/your/.env.production xyne-app:usr/src/app/frontend/.env.production
```

And the restart the docker container using :

```javascript
docker restart xyne-app
```
