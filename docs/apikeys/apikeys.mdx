This guide providers more details about creating and setting AI api keys in your .env file for using Xyne's chat feature.

To use **AI chat**, you need to configure access credentials. You can use one of the following providers: ***AWS, OpenAI, or Ollama***.

### AWS (Amazon Bedrock) 

- Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home)
- Generate your ```Access Key``` and ```Secret Key```.
- Add them as environment variables in your ```.env.default``` file:
    ```javascript   .env.default
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY> 
    ```
    <Note> The ```AWS_REGION``` key is optional in the ```.env.default``` file; if not provided, it defaults to ```us-west-2``` </Note>

### OpenAI
- Create an API key from the [OpenAI API settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).
- Add it as environment variables in your .env.default file:
    ```javascript .env.default
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY> 
    ```
### Ollama (Local LLM)
- Install Ollama and the desired model from ollama.com.
- Add the model name in your .env.default file:
    ```javascript .env.default
    OLLAMA_MODEL=<YOUR_OLLAMA_MODEL_NAME> 
    ```
<Tip> If you're using Ollama, ensure the specified model is downloaded locally. </Tip>    
### Key Selection Order : 
If multiple keys are set in the environment variable, our system follows this precedence:
```javascript 
AWS → OpenAI → Ollama
```
<Tip>Only anyone provider is required to get started. This means either AWS or OpenAI or Ollama can be used, all of them aren't required.</Tip>
