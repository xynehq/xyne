This guide assumes you have created the desired authentication keys, and will show you how to ingest your data into the Xyne application. 

If you haven't already setup the authentication, follow this guide below : 

<CardGroup>

<Card

</Card>

<Card
  title="Service Account Authentication"
  icon="gear-code"
  href="/authentication/oauth"

</Card>

## Connect to Google Integration and ingest data: 

Once you have setup the authentication keys and have started the application, you will see your application running in the browser. 

 - Once you login with your google account, this screen will appear :

<img height="200" src="../images/ingest1.png" />

 - On the left you will find a ```plug``` icon. That's our connector.  
<img height="200" src="../images/ingest2.png" />

- Now depending on which authentication key you have configured, you can choose ingestion using ```Service Account``` or ingest using ```Oauth Account```
