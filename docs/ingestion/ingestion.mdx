This guide assumes you have created the required authentication keys, and will show you how to ingest your data into the Xyne application. 

<Tip>If you're running the application individually and just trying it out, we recommend using OAuth authentication. 
Service accounts are better suited for organizations.</Tip>

<Note> You only need one type of Authentication, either OAuth Authentication [best suited for individual users] or Service Account Authentication  [best suited for organizations]. </Note>

If you haven't already setup the authentication, follow this guide below :

## Connect to Google Integration and ingest data: 

Once you have setup the authentication keys and have started the application, you will see your application running in the browser. 

 - Once you login with your google account successfully, this screen will appear :

 - On the left you will find a ```plug``` icon. That's our connector.

- Now depending on which authentication key you have configured, you can choose ingestion using ```Oauth Account``` or ingest using ```Service Account```.
