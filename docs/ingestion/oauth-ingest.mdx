```

Once you have uploaded the file, click on ```Create Integration```. This will create the Google integration, Once that done, you will see the ```Connect with Google OAuth``` button. 
Click on that button, you will see the screen where you can choose which account you want to connect with.

Once the ingestion has completed, you can go back to the Xyne App's Chat Or Search section using the ```+``` icon on the left side menu to start a new chat.
