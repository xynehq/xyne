# Silent Retries

If a transaction fails because of a technical reason, we retry the transaction with a different PSP.

Te decision whether to retry or not is based on error reason.

# Manual Retries

In case a transaction fails with a definitive error message, we redirect the user to a Payment Retry screen and nudge the user to use a different Payment Instrument

For the first merchant, we retried 1,163 transactions over a 24 hr window and 798 were successful
