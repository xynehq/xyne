    "answer": "The proposed solution is to implement a threshold-based check. This means the system will not sync a transaction for the first 'x' retries or 't' minutes if it has not been initiated. Syncing will only begin after that threshold is passed. This approach is intended to reduce early sync failures while also handling potential system issues like pod crashes. Additionally, it was suggested that if a sync results in the payment gateway reporting 'no order found', the system should not attempt to sync that transaction again.",

    "answer": "Sync tasks are scheduled agnostically of the initiation call to handle potential system failures. This is a safeguard in case a pod crashes after the initiation call is made but before the database status has been reliably updated. In that scenario, the scheduled sync is necessary to reconcile the transaction's status.",

Can you tell me why the scheduler isn't picking these up?",
    "answer": "The refund was not initiated immediately because the merchant `tvsmotor` was not enabled in the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` configuration.

For one test card (4242...8007), the redeem option isn't appearing due to a 'Missing Mandatory Params PROGRAM_CODE' error. For another card (4357...4343), the redeem option appears but points are not deducted. What were the root causes and resolutions for these problems?",
    "answer": "The issues were diagnosed and addressed as follows:\n\n1.  **Card ending in 8007 (Missing Redeem Option):** The initial 'Missing Mandatory Params PROGRAM_CODE' error occurred because the corresponding `program_code` was not present in the sandbox database. The Loylty team provided the code ('YES DC'), which was then added. This led to a subsequent issue where the system incorrectly validated the 6-digit BIN as a US card. A fix for this was pushed to CUG. However, the latest error reported from the Loylty gateway for this card is 'Member Profile Not Found'.\n\n2.  **Card ending in 4343 (Points Not Deducted):** The failure to deduct points was caused by the Loylty 'fetch Balance' API timing out. The Loylty team suggested this might have been due to infrastructure changes on their end and asked to retry. A separate 'Invalid Client Auth Token' error was also encountered on the payment page; this was attributed to testing via Postman without passing a `customerId` in the `/cards/balance` API call.",

    "question": "Why would I be getting an 'Invalid Client Auth Token or signature' error when calling the /cards/balance API, even if other API calls are working with the same token?",
    "answer": "Based on the discussion, this error occurs because the `/cards/balance` API call is being made without required linking data, such as a `customerId`, associated with the client auth token. This situation is particularly common when testing via an API client like Postman, where the token is sent without the context of a customer or order ID.",

Initially, the transaction did not process correctly because the merchant needed to be added to the `schedule_level_mandate_execution_enabled_merchants` configuration in the sandbox environment. After this was fixed, a subsequent retry attempt failed because the GSM check returned an error: \"User doesn't have sufficient balance in the account | Retarget_payment is not enabled by the merchant.\" A final attempt failed because the grace period for retrying had expired, as the grace period starts from the time of the initial transaction execution.",

    "answer": "The 'sample modal' does not show a real-time count but rather a sample of up to 100 orders. The discrepancy with the summary count occurs because the modal incorrectly combines both 'orders_with_transaction' and 'new orders' (orders without a transaction), whereas the summary count only includes 'orders_with_transaction'.",

Different gateways had different requirements for the refund order. Using the transaction ID-based API offloaded the responsibility of this decision from Juspay. The move to order ID-based refunds for a limited set of gateways was a step towards giving Juspay more control over the refund process based on a known logic (parent first, then child).",

This change made the system send `order succeeded` webhooks for auto-refunded transactions if a merchant's `webhook_api_version` was set to null, which was a change from the previous behavior. The resolution was to raise a hotfix (PR 5886) to correct this logic.\n\n2.  **Encrypted Webhook Credentials:** This was a Sev1 issue where webhook authorization headers contained encrypted data instead of the correct username/password. The root cause was a deployment that enabled PII encryption for new columns in the `merchant_account` table (like `webHookUsername` and `webHookPassword`). The service writing the data encrypted it, but the reading services lacked the corresponding decryption logic. The resolution was to revert the changes and run a fix on the production database to correct the affected data.",

    "answer": "The EMI+Mandate flow issue was caused by the `card info API` responding with general mandate support (`mandate_support` as True) without having the context for the combined EMI+Mandate flow. This led to transactions getting stuck in the 'STARTED' state because no intersecting gateway could be found that actually supported the specific flow.\n\nSeparately, the issue with Gateway Status Mapping (GSM) for an ICICI_UPI refund was that a mapping existed which incorrectly updated the status to 'success' based on a response message ('Transaction Successful'), even though the gateway's actual status was 'PENDING'. This practice of using GSM to determine a final success status was identified as risky, and the specific mapping was disabled.",

    "answer": "Physics Wallah reported a very low success rate (<1%) for DC EMI on PAYTM_V2. The root cause was a bug where our system incorrectly handled the `eligible = false` response from Paytm's eligibility API. This required a code-level fix, which was developed, tested, and deployed in a gateway release. \n\nSavana had an issue with missing ARNs for successful refunds. This was resolved through configuration changes and data synchronization. A hard sync was performed on ~12k past refunds, the ARN sync frequency configuration was updated, and the sync duration was increased to 30 days per the merchant's request.",

    "answer": "There were two recent issues with API error messages. First, the payment methods and /txns APIs were returning a '500 Internal Server Error' in the sandbox environment. The root cause was a new configuration value ('GCI' for 'FlowConfigSource') being set on new Merchant Gateway Accounts that was not supported by the backend 'euler-db'. This was resolved via a hotfix and backfilling the affected accounts. Second, a request was made to change the detailed JSON error response for refund attempts on MIDs where refunds are disabled to a simpler message. The investigation suggested this was not a simple code change, as the complex error response appeared to be incorrectly stored in the Refund Table in the database.",

    "answer": "The two incidents have different root causes and are at different stages of resolution:\n\n1.  **Offer Transactions (Zepto):** The root cause was a code transformation error where the mandatory `TxnOfferDetailStatus` field was missing. This was traced back to a recent \"rust decider\" service config release. The issue has been **resolved** by rolling back that release, which stopped the errors.\n\n2.  **Bulk API:** The root cause for the random 500 errors is still under investigation. The current debugging approach is focused on improving observability by adding a custom `x-request-id` (as a UUID) to the request headers to allow for better tracing. The investigation is **ongoing**, with the team analyzing specific failed request IDs (e.g., `94f2af1d-4708-4ab7-a5f2-ddd24db82545`) to debug the issue.",

    "answer": "There were two separate issues. For merchants like Zepto, production transaction latency was not caused by a PT sync failure as initially suspected. The root cause was that the default sync frequency (starting at 300 seconds) is too slow for their 3-minute fulfillment window, and a custom frequency needs to be configured. For the issue affecting ABSLI in UAT, users were not being redirected to the payment simulator page. This was caused by a recent SDK change that triggered multiple `pay/start` calls, which has since been reverted.",

The 'CARD_CATEGORY_ECI_REFUSED' error for Myntra was an internal system issue where RUPAY card BINs were being misidentified as AMEX BINs during the authorization step, which required a code fix. In contrast, the 'Mismatch between payment instrument and payment locking filter' error for Acciojobs was a merchant configuration issue, where they were disabling a payment method in the `payment_filter` and then attempting to use that same method for the transaction.",

The initial analysis by Amit Shukla suggests that if Paypal supports it, the merchant should be able to as well.\n2.  **Pinelabs for Zepto**: An issue was identified where transactions failed because Pinelabs was not sending three mandatory fields in its response for a small percentage of cases.

The root cause was identified as a `429 Too many requests` error, indicating that the transaction per second (TPS) rate was exceeding the expected limit.\n2.  **API Response Latency:** Zepto reported increased polling and a drop in their UPI Success Rate. This was traced back to an increase in our P999 redis latency, causing our API response time to exceed Zepto's 500ms timeout threshold, leading them to mark transactions as failed.",

    "answer": "Yes, we've addressed a few recent issues caused by data synchronization problems:\n\n1.  **Payment Gateway Response:** For the merchant `eazydiner`, transactions weren't automatically marked as successful. This was due to a decode failure because our system expected a mandatory `vpa` in the UPI response from the Pinelabs Online gateway, which was not present. A code change was deployed to fix this.\n\n2.  **Card Token Status:** We were seeing around 750 daily transaction failures for \"Unable to fetch token.\" The root cause was a mismatch between the token's status in our system and its actual state at the card networks (e.g., token being invalid or ineligible). To resolve this, we are implementing a token status check API and an asynchronous process to update token statuses after a failure.",

    "answer": "We have faced two significant issues recently related to transaction status handling. First, for the Pinelabs gateway, transactions that were actually 'Pending' were being incorrectly marked as 'Failed' in our system. This led to 'Failure to Success' cases, causing major reconciliation problems and an escalation from the merchant Tripjack. The root cause was an incorrect status mapping for a response code combination not present in their documentation. Second, some orders are getting stuck in the 'NEW' state when the initial transaction API call fails due to a network error. This is misleading for merchants as the failure is not visible on their dashboard, preventing them from taking action like re-initiating the transaction. The proposed solution is to mark these orders as 'JUSPAY_DECLINED' to provide better visibility.",

A fix was deployed on Feb 5th, but logs for that specific transaction could not be recovered as it occurred before the fix. For JIRA EUL-13814, the issue was a token transaction failure after a token was deleted by one user, which affected all users of the same card.

    "answer": "The 500 error for HDFC on the /session API was caused by an internal bug. A recent dashboard change incorrectly removed the `is_pii_encrypted` flag from the merchant's metadata, leading to a KMS decryption failure. The issue was resolved by reverting the change.\n\nFor the other merchants:\n- **Zoomcar:** They are experiencing 400 errors on `/txns` calls. The investigation suggests this is likely an external issue caused by their system making multiple calls for the same order ID, although Zoomcar suspects it might be our SDK.\n- **Zepto:** They reported that EMI flows are not triggering on iOS.

    "answer": "The problem occurred in several scenarios where an initial gateway interaction failed, leading to status inconsistencies. These included: failures during the initial transaction step (`GW_INIT_TXN`) with 5xx errors on gateways like `gocashfree` and `PAYU`; failures during OTP verification (`GW_VERIFY_OTP`); and failures during synchronous authorization (`GW_AUTHORIZATION_SYNC`) due to `429` rate-limiting errors. A specific instance involved a status check with the TPSL gateway timing out, which caused the transaction to be incorrectly marked as 'Authentication Failed' and subsequent webhooks to fail decoding. A similar latency issue was also seen with mpokket via Paytm_v2.\n\nThe new behavior, which is now live, is to keep the transaction in a 'Pending' state when a synchronous status check fails due to timeouts or 5xx errors. This prevents a premature failure and allows the status to be correctly updated by a later status check or webhook sync.",

First, for the Euler dashboard, it's suggested to handle non-error messages like 'COD Initiated' and 'UNKNOWN' on the dashboard side to avoid misrepresenting them as errors, without changing the API which could risk breaking merchant integrations.

Monitoring confirmed the issue is resolved.\n\n2.  **'Card bin not found' Error (Partial Captures):**\n    *   **Root Cause:** This error happened because the system was incorrectly using a card BIN to query the token BIN database table during the partial capture flow. This was due to a logic issue where a token BIN was replaced by a card BIN in a transaction object, but a related flag (`is_token_bin`) was not updated.\n    *   **Status:** The fix was successfully deployed and tested in the sandbox.

A code change was successfully tested in the sandbox environment and has been deployed to production. For the Airpay PG issue, where transactions are marked as failed due to internal API call failures (e.g., for OAuth tokens or order status) instead of the PG's transaction status, a JIRA ticket (EUL-17460) has been created to track the fix, but a deployed resolution is not mentioned in the threads.",

This will allow merchants to self-serve on issues like understanding transaction failure reasons, investigating status mismatches (e.g., customer debited but transaction failed), and inquiring about pending transactions. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to improve merchant-facing observability, as making issues visible on a dashboard is expected to help merchants prioritize fixes faster, a lesson learned from the prolonged ICICIPRU webhook problem.

The estimated time for the production fix is July 30th. Regarding alerts, a real-time SEV alert would likely not have been triggered. Our system only triggers real-time alerts for issues with a high overall impact on a merchant; for lower-impact issues, a daily mailer is sent to the support team instead.",

    "answer": "The issue of refunds getting stuck due to unexpected gateway responses is a known problem. The team's strategy for the refunds workflow is to use a deterministic approach with standardized email templates, which have been created for responding to both single and multiple orders. For well-defined failure cases, the plan is to identify the scenario and use a specific template for an automated action, such as emailing the Payment Gateway to ask why the failure occurred. This templated method is preferred for refunds, while AI/LLMs are being used more for drafting responses to transaction-related queries that have greater variation.",

The process would involve giving the LLM context on the issue (the spike in 'No Bank response' failures from PayU) and providing it with BigQuery table schemas. The LLM could then generate a relevant query to pull the affected transactions.

    "answer": "We have handled such requests in a couple of ways:\n\n1.  **For Instant Refunds (PayU):** A merchant wanted to bypass our standard 20-25 minute refund processing delay. The solution was to add their merchant ID to the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` config. This skips our internal scheduler but requires confirming that the gateway is prepared for traffic surges and the merchant can handle potential increases in API latency.\n\n2.  **For Card Features (Razorpay DOTP):** For a merchant whose card BIN was not correctly identified as supporting Direct OTP (DOTP), the solution was to perform a BIN sync. This process, which can be done via an API or an automated monthly sync, updates our `gateway_card_info` table with the correct data from Razorpay.",

    "answer": "There were two recent, distinct issues:\n\n1.  **Hyperpay Webhook Decryption Failure:** For merchant `gabit`, webhooks were failing with a 400 error. The root cause was that the system could not decrypt the webhook request because the necessary secret key was not configured. The fix was to update the gateway schema to make the secret key a mandatory field for webhooks to prevent this from being missed in the future.\n\n2.  **Stuck Refunds Logic Failure:** Some refunds were getting stuck in a pending state and moving to manual review. This happened when a 'transaction declined by beneficiary bank' error occurred. Although this error is configured for retry, the system's logic prevented the retry because an `epg txn id` was already present. The proposed product fix is to change the logic so that if an `epg txn id` exists and the error is retryable, the transaction is moved to 'Failure', allowing the merchant to re-initiate it.",

First, numerous transactions failed because `DOTP` (Device OTP) and `CVVless` were enabled on a gateway where the parent `CARD PMT` method was disabled. Second, `UPI_QR` transactions for the same merchant were incorrectly routed to the Billdesk gateway, where `UPI_QR` was not enabled, because the decider was only checking for the parent `UPI` method's enablement.

    "answer": "Certainly. Here are two recent examples:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Merchant Request:** A merchant attempting partial split refunds received an \"INVALID_INPUT\" error. The root cause was that they were passing the parameter `amount` in the request body, whereas for partial split refunds, the correct parameter is `refund_amount` nested within the `metadata.split_settlement_details` object.\n\n2.  **Internal Processing Bug:** For a merchant's instant refund feature, the payment gateway (Billdesk) was correctly sending the customer's VPA in the transaction response. However, our system failed to capture it. This was due to an internal bug where our logging happened after data type matching, obscuring the incoming field, and our logic failed to correctly overwrite the `payment_source` with the VPA received from the gateway.",

To debug this, engineers unfiltered the transaction request logs to verify the `bankCode` being sent, confirming that Juspay was correctly sending the configured code `1350`.\n\nFor the starhealth merchant, an order status mismatch occurred after a transaction was initiated twice. The gateway returned a list with both the failed and successful attempts. Juspay's system incorrectly mapped the order to the first (failed) entry in the list instead of the successful one. The root cause was that the system logic was designed to only process the head of the response list, which is now identified as an issue to be fixed.",

The system also lacked the logic to parse image sources directly from HTML. Additionally, Genius may not extract data from an image if it isn't explicitly labeled (e.g., a request ID without a corresponding text label).\n2.  **Prompt Specificity (AI Tools):** For tools like the AI code summarizer, it was noted that they might not work as expected on the first try. The recommended solution is to rephrase the prompt in a more detailed manner to get the correct result.\n\nThe primary fix being implemented for the Genius system is to add the necessary logic to parse HTML and handle inline attachments.

    "answer": "There were two distinct issues. For Smallcase, the 'Get UTR flow' was failing due to a decoding error. This was caused by the `utrNumber` field being unexpectedly absent from the `merchantSplitDetails` block in the payment gateway's response. The issue was resolved by making this field non-mandatory.\n\nFor naviloans and naviAMC, they experienced a significant Success Rate (SR) drop because their payment gateway, Razorpay, was failing to initiate transactions. The impact was high as they rely heavily on Razorpay and had no backup gateways configured at the time of the incident.",

The root cause was a `TYPE_MISMATCH` for the `cardGlobalFingerprint` field, which was receiving a `Null` value instead of the expected `String`. This issue impacted multiple merchants. For the scheduled PhonePe outage, a specific outage instance was configured at the `pmt-wallet` and `pm-phonepe` level. This was done to ensure merchants like mplgaming, who use the PhonePe wallet/container flow, would correctly see the service as 'DOWN' via the outage API.",

    "answer": "There were two recent critical issues:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Fund Settlement:** A bug was caused by a wrong Merchant ID (MID) in the Breeze frontend configuration. This led to Euler creating an order for the correct merchant but using a different merchant's gateway account for the transaction, resulting in funds being settled to the wrong merchant. This impacted \"breeze\" merchants using UPI & Net Banking. A hotfix for this has been released.\n\n2.  **Simpl Pay Later iOS Integration:** Multiple merchants reported being unable to build their iOS apps after adding the Simpl Fingerprint SDK. The Simpl team confirmed this is an issue on their end that will take around 3 months to fix. The temporary workaround is for merchants to hardcode the device parameters for iOS devices.",

For inactive user accounts, the plan is to implement a self-serve feature that automatically triggers an email to the admin and CCs the user.

    "answer": "There are two recent synchronization issues with the Euler system affecting different payment gateways:\n\n1.  **HDFC_UPI:** The Transaction Status API is returning a 403 error for normal collect and intent flows. This is because incorrect parameters are being sent in the sync request, causing transactions to be marked as failed on our end even when they are successful at the gateway. This is currently breaking the flow in UAT and is under investigation (JIRA: EUL-18312).\n\n2.  **CAMSPAY:** Refunds for `EMANDATE_REGISTER` and mandate payments are getting stuck in \"Manual Review\" due to response timeouts. The root cause is that our system does not have a refund sync implementation for these specific transaction types with CAMSPAY, although the gateway itself supports it (JIRA: EUL-16884).",

    "answer": "We recently had a critical issue with the PAYU gateway for the merchant Meesho, where failed transactions were stuck in 'Pending' status for over 30 minutes. This was traced back to certain bank error codes (e.g., E312, E1903) being configured to wait instead of causing an instant failure. The recommendation is to update the Gateway State Machine (GSM) to fix this. Additionally, HDFC Cybersource is mandating a security upgrade to P12 Authentication for their SOAP APIs, which we use for transactions.

The issue appeared to resolve after the merchant asked users to reinstall their app, and the order state numbers have since returned to normal. Regarding testing limitations, Billdesk mandates cannot be tested in the UAT environment because Billdesk has not provided UAT credentials or set up a mandate simulator for Juspay in UAT.

To prevent this, a technical solution being discussed is creating a 'deployment graph' to manage dependencies and enforce a specific deployment order (e.g., read services before write services).

    "answer": "The UPI intent failure for Zepto occurred because Juspay was constructing its own UPI deeplink, which omitted the `mode=02` parameter required by the merchant's new VPA with Kotak bank. This caused transactions via the CRED app to be declined. The fix involves prioritizing the full deeplink URL (`pgIntentUrl`) sent by the Payment Gateway (PG) instead of constructing our own.\n\nRegarding order IDs, our system does support UUIDs with hyphens. The validation allows for the special characters `-_+~{}.)` as long as the order ID begins with an alphanumeric character. However, it's important to note that some downstream PGs have their own restrictions on special characters or length, so compatibility isn't guaranteed across all of them.",

Second, card payments failed with a `Bin range not enabled` error, which was an issue on the gateway's side.\n*   **Mandate Payments:** An `ORDER_FAILED` webhook was not sent for a failed mandate payment. The root cause was an internal pod restart during webhook construction, not an issue with handling a 500 response from the gateway as initially suspected.\n\n**PII Requirements for Gateways:**\n*   **LSP:** The `customerMobile` field is mandatory for multiple APIs, including `CheckEligibility` and `initiateOrderCreate`.\n*   **PayU:** For initiating a transaction, `email` and `phone` are mandatory fields.\n\nIt's also noted that while some gateways have PII fields as optional, they do not recommend passing dummy values as it can trigger risk checks and cause transactions to fail.",

This is because downloaded data is based on transaction creation time, which may pull in transactions for orders created outside the selected date range. Furthermore, at the order level, the system only displays details from the latest transaction.\n\n2. **Refunds:** The refund amount calculation logic must specifically exclude `auto_refunded` transactions and only consider `charged` and `partially charged` ones.

    "question": "I'm reviewing our order and refund processes. Can you tell me about any new features being developed for COD orders via the `order_create` API, and also if there are any known issues or manual processes for handling refunds that fail to reach the gateway?",
    "answer": "A new feature is being developed for Cash on Delivery (COD) orders, allowing merchants to collect an upfront token amount online. This involves passing a `cod_advance_payment_amount` in the `order_create` call, and an integrity check is being implemented to enforce this amount. It's important to note that order ID-based split refunds for these COD transactions are not currently supported.\n\nSeparately, for instances where a refund is initiated but fails to be sent to the payment gateway (marked as `sent_to_gateway: false`), there is a manual process to resolve this. These refunds can be rescheduled by triggering an internal admin API: `/ec/v1/admin/refund/schedule/:txn_detail_id/:merchantId`.",

    "question": "Can you provide recent examples of bugs where our system's logic made incorrect assumptions about the data it was processing, specifically in the context of available payment options and refund statuses?",
    "answer": "Yes, here are two recent examples of bugs caused by incorrect logical assumptions:\n\n1.  **Payment Options:** An issue (PICAF-29551) occurred where Bank of India was not displayed as a payment option for e-mandates. The UI logic incorrectly assumed that for a bank to be displayed, it must support Net Banking as an authentication method. The fix involved changing the logic to show any bank listed in the `emandate` block as long as it supports at least one authentication method (e.g., Net Banking, Card, or Aadhar).\n\n2.  **Refund Statuses:** A refund processed via the Morpheus gateway remained in a 'Pending' state instead of being marked 'Failed'. Our system's refund update logic incorrectly assumed that a failure response from the gateway would always contain a non-empty `transactions` array. In this specific case, the failure happened before a transaction was even created (due to an incorrect IFSC code), so the `transactions` array was empty. Our logic did not account for this scenario, causing the status to remain 'Pending'.",

Which specific field should I use, and what's the recommended way to verify its values in BigQuery, especially since I've heard about some transaction data not appearing in the `kv.transactions_view` table?",
    "answer": "For the refund amount, you should use the `order_amount_refunded` field. You can verify its values by querying the `kv.transactions` table in BigQuery or by using the bulk-download api/qapi. It is worth noting that there have been instances where some orders were not found in BQ tables like `kv.transactions_view`, even when they were visible on the dashboard.",

    "answer": "There have been two recent items concerning the `dpplatform` MID. First, a feature request was made to allow transactions for amounts less than Re 1. It was determined that this is not possible as the minimum amount of Re 1 is hardcoded and there is no configuration to change it. Second, an issue was investigated where a transaction had a status of `AUTHORIZATION_FAILED` but the payment gateway's response message was \"Transaction is successful\". This was due to the gateway (Pine) sending a success message for what was actually a failed transaction.",

    "answer": "For the SPM outage API, you should rely on the outer status for Payment Method (PM) level outages (e.g., wallets), as it will be correctly set to 'DOWN'. The `subdetails` block is only to be used for more granular outages, like at the PSP or card-type level. For the order-status API, the ARN for the forward transaction can be found in the `pgr` (payment_gateway_response) block of the response from the `txn_details` table; this block specifically contains forward transaction data, not refund data.",

    "answer": "There have been a couple of recent issues reported by merchants related to payment flows:\n\n1.  For the merchant 'ajio' using the JIOPAY gateway in the sandbox environment, Net Banking transactions were failing with a `paymentOptionCodes is not correct` error. The root cause was a configuration mismatch where the gateway codes in the sandbox did not align with production. The fix was to add the production gateway payment method entries into the sandbox environment.\n\n2.  Merchant 'amexgbt' experienced an issue where customers were shown a blank screen upon payment failure. This occurred when ALT_ID generation failed, resulting in a `JUSPAY_DECLINED` status that the payment page did not handle correctly when a return URL wasn't configured. A fix to properly handle this error state was pushed to production.",

    "answer": "For the merchant Zepto, the engineering team built and deployed a new API to allow them to retrieve saved VPAs for their customers, a critical requirement for their migration to the Express Checkout flow (Jira: EUL-16695). For Tataaia, an issue was investigated regarding the Billdesk gateway where transactions were succeeding despite a surcharge being added. It was determined that this was expected behavior, as the integrity check for non-Customer Fee Bearing transactions is correctly performed on the `normal_amount`, not the `charge_amount` (Jira: EUL-18693).",

    "answer": "Several recent bugs have impacted transactions and refunds:\n1. **Transaction Initiation Failure:** A content-type mismatch (`application/json` instead of `url-encoded`) caused `null` request bodies to be sent to Razorpay, failing the transaction. This was fixed by reverting the change.\n2. **Refund Rejection:** Refunds failed with a \"transaction not CHARGED\" error due to duplicate transaction records created by a faulty silent retry logic on split payments. The fix involved a data correction for affected orders and a code fix for the `txnId` generation logic.\n3. **Incorrect Refund Amount Calculation:** A critical bug was raised concerning the `maximum_eligible_refund_amount` field, which merchants were using for refunds. This field is for offer validation and doesn't account for discounts. The suggested workaround is for merchants to calculate the refundable amount using the formula: `pendingRefundAmount = txnAmount - refundedAmount(Pending + success) - chargeBack`.",
