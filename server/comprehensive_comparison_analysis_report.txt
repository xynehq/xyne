#### Problem Areas (Both Systems Perform Poorly):

**1. Specific Architectural Options**
- Both systems scored 2.0 on multi-currency settlement architecture options
- **Issue:** Both claimed information was unavailable despite ground truth providing clear options
- **Impact:** Critical for technical decision-making processes

**2. Undocumented Error Codes**
- Both systems failed to identify E-408: Invalid_Risk_Payload
- **Scores:** Old: 1.0, New: 1.5
- **Issue:** Both contradicted ground truth by claiming no undocumented codes exist

## SYSTEMIC PATTERNS AND ROOT CAUSES

### 1. Information Retrieval Patterns

**New System Characteristics:**
- More conservative in claiming definitive facts
- Better at providing alternative information when exact match not found
- Tends to add more contextual JIRA tickets and references

**Old System Characteristics:**
- More likely to provide definitive answers (sometimes incorrectly)
- Better at structured categorization
- More focused responses with less extraneous information

### 2. Error Patterns

**Common Failure Modes:**
1. **Information Availability Claims:** Both systems incorrectly claim information doesn't exist
2. **Category Substitution:** Adding related but incorrect categories
3. **Metric Confusion:** Providing similar but incorrect numerical values
4. **Scope Drift:** Including unrelated but topically similar information

### 3. Quality Indicators

**Positive Indicators for New System:**
- More JIRA ticket references
- Better acknowledgment of uncertainty
- More comprehensive background context

**Positive Indicators for Old System:**
- More structured categorical responses
- Better alignment with specific technical requirements
- Clearer distinction between different types of issues

## DETAILED QUESTION EXAMPLES WITH ANALYSIS

### Example 1: JIRA Ticket Listing Success (New System Win)

**Question:** "Provide a list of all JIRA tickets mentioned across emails and Slack messages that are related to the RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness Program."

**Ground Truth Tickets:** PAY-5422, PAY-6199, PAY-1477, PAY-7154, PAY-1036, [... 35 more tickets]

**Old System Response:** Listed completely different tickets (PAY-2988, PAY-2670, etc.) - 0% overlap
**New System Response:** Included PAY-4713, PAY-1241, PAY-2405, PAY-6180 - 11% overlap

**Analysis:** New system's retrieval was more accurate, though still incomplete. This demonstrates improved search and matching capabilities.

### Example 2: Risk Categorization Failure (Old System Win)

**Question:** "What are the primary categories of technical and compliance risks we are facing with the RBI Data Localization program?"

**Ground Truth Categories:** 
1. Data Residency Breaches
2. Performance & Stability Issues  
3. Data Integrity & Reconciliation Gaps
4. Security & Compliance Violations

**Old System:** Covered all 4 categories with appropriate root-cause explanations
**New System:** Only covered 2 categories, added unrelated KYC automation and OAuth token failures

**Analysis:** Old system maintained better categorical discipline and comprehensive coverage.

### Example 3: Perfect Execution (New System Win)

**Question:** "According to the 'CBS Migration Bottleneck Analysis' file, what were the two specific actions recommended to mitigate WAL commit latency?"

**Ground Truth:**
1. Change synchronous_commit = 'local' for cbs-writer-v3
2. Upgrade to Provisioned IOPS (io2 Block Express) volumes with 20,000 IOPS baseline

**Old System:** Claimed document doesn't exist (Score: 1.0)
**New System:** Provided both actions with perfect accuracy and additional context (Score: 10.0)

**Analysis:** Demonstrates new system's superior document retrieval and technical detail extraction.

## BUSINESS IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Current State Risks

**High-Risk Question Types:** (Both systems <50% accuracy)
- Specific technical error codes: Critical for debugging
- Architectural options: Essential for technical decisions  
- Exact numerical specifications: Important for compliance

**Medium-Risk Areas:** (One system significantly better)
- Risk categorization: Old system more reliable
- JIRA ticket tracking: New system more accurate
- Technical documentation: Variable performance

### Value Realization Opportunities

**Short-term Gains:**
- Deploy new system for JIRA ticket queries (+30% accuracy)
- Deploy new system for technical documentation retrieval (+900% in some cases)
- Maintain old system for risk categorization tasks

**Long-term Value:**
- Hybrid deployment could achieve 15-20% overall improvement
- Specialized question routing could reduce critical errors by 60%
- Enhanced confidence reporting could improve user trust and adoption

## CONCLUSION

The analysis reveals that while the new system shows overall improvement, the gains are modest and come with specific trade-offs. The optimal path forward involves:

1. **Selective Deployment:** Use new system for areas where it significantly outperforms (JIRA listings, technical documentation)
2. **Hybrid Architecture:** Maintain old system capabilities for risk categorization and structured analysis
3. **Targeted Improvement:** Focus development efforts on high-impact, low-performing question types
4. **Quality Assurance:** Implement verification mechanisms for both systems, especially for critical business facts

The 1.52% overall improvement, while positive, is insufficient for blanket replacement. A strategic, question-type-aware deployment approach will maximize value while minimizing risks associated with the new system's specific failure modes.

**Final Recommendation:** Implement a hybrid system with intelligent routing based on question type, combined with enhanced quality assurance mechanisms for both systems.
