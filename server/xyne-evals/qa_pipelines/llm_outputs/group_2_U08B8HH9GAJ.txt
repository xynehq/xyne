    "Question": "What is the current situation with the request to add new bank codes? Summarize who is involved and what actions are being taken or requested.",
    "Answer": "Ananya Gupta initiated a request to add a list of new bank codes. She has asked Rajarajan to confirm if the proposed values are correct, highlighting a critical constraint: the values for `juspay_bank_code` cannot be deleted from the dashboard once they are inserted. In response, Advait Mahesh has confirmed that he and 'malav' will get these codes added. The pending action is the confirmation from Rajarajan on the exact values before insertion."

    "Question": "Based on the conversation where I am mentioned, what is the single most critical constraint that requires my confirmation before proceeding with the bank code insertion?",
    "Answer": "The most critical constraint, as stated by Ananya Gupta, is that the `juspay_bank_code` values cannot be deleted once they are inserted through the dashboard. This is why she is seeking your confirmation on the exact values to ensure they are correct before the insertion is performed."

    "Question": "How do the recent activities in the 'one-team' channel reflect its core purpose?",
    "Answer": "The 'one-team' channel's goal is to \"build comprehensive products, improve quality, automate processes, all tightly aligned with the current and long term merchant needs.\"\n\nThe recent discussion about adding new bank codes directly reflects this purpose. Specifically:\n- **Building comprehensive products:** Adding new bank codes expands the product's capabilities.\n- **Improving quality:** Ananya Gupta's insistence on getting the exact values from Rajarajan because they \"can not delete it once inserted\" demonstrates a focus on data integrity and quality assurance before making system changes."
