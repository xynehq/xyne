    "Question": "Based on the retrospective, what was the underlying cause of our recent challenges, and how are we planning to mitigate such issues going forward?",
    "Answer": "The retrospective indicates the underlying cause of challenges was related to project pressures and resource gaps. The technical debt was incurred because the legacy system integration was 'rushed' due to 'timeline pressures'. Concurrently, the team was 'under-resourced for QA', leading to bugs in the beta release. The plan to mitigate this is to address the resource gap by hiring another dedicated QA engineer, which is an action item for Q3."
