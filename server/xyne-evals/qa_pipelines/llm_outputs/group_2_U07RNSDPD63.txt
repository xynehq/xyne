    "Question": "What is the urgent task related to Gyftyr, and which team members were asked to get involved?",
    "Answer": "The urgent task is to provide support for an 'open router' integration that the merchant Gyftyr has requested. Malyada Goverdhan asked Prabu M, Milind Tahalani, and Divya Arora to shadow the product team on a couple of integrations to learn the process and then pick it up themselves. The urgency is due to merchants being 'pressurised by the PAs'."

    "Answer": "The primary focus of the 'one-team' is to 'build comprehensive products, improve quality, automate processes, all tightly aligned with the current and long term merchant needs,' with a topic of 'Make payments reliable!'. Recent conversations reflect this by discussing specific merchant-facing tasks like a new PG integration, an urgent 'open router' integration for Gyftyr, and finding workarounds when PGs hinder product development."
