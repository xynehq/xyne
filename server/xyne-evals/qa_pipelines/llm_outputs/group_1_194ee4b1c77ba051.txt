    "Question": "What is the specific requirement enhancement requested in Jira issue EUL-20018 for HDFC_UPI QR transactions?",
    "Answer": "For HDFC_UPI QR transactions, the enhancement request (EUL-20018) is to map the user's VPA (Virtual Payment Address). This VPA is obtained from the `payerVirtualAddress` parameter in the webhook payload. The goal is to have this VPA exposed in the PGR and OrderDetails API, which are used by the dashboard."

    "Question": "Based on the provided messages, what are the different kinds of issues being faced with webhook processing?",
    "Answer": "Based on the documents, there are several distinct issues with webhook processing:\n1.  **Decoding Failures:** For EaseBuzz webhooks, there is a `TYPE_MISMATCH` where the `data` field is received as a `String` instead of an `Object`. Additionally, a required `event` field is missing from the gateway's response payload.\n2.  **Missing Webhooks:** For a transaction with the TPSL gateway (Jira issue EUL-19919), no webhooks were triggered at all, leading to a status mismatch where the transaction is `CAPTURED` at the gateway but remains `AUTHORIZED` in the system.\n3.  **Integrity Failures:** For order ID `IC-66981410`, multiple webhooks were received, but after the first one was accepted, the subsequent ones were rejected with a \"Could not verify integrity of webhook response\" error.\n4.  **Duplicate Handling:** A question was raised about why subsequent duplicate webhooks were not being rejected with a \"duplicate webhook\" error, suggesting a potential issue in the duplicate detection logic."

    "Question": "Can you list the specific technical errors and expected data structures mentioned in relation to the EaseBuzz webhook failures?",
    "Answer": "Yes, the specific technical details for the EaseBuzz webhook failures are:\n1.  **Error Log:** An `APP_ERROR` log shows an exception with the code `Exception while extracting webhook response`. The specific error is a `TYPE_MISMATCH` on the `errField` named `data`.\n2.  **Expected vs. Actual:** The system expected the `data` field to be an `Object` but the `actualValue` was a `String`.\n3.  **Code Definition:** The internal data type `EaseBuzzNotificationStatusUpdateWebhook` is defined with two fields: `dataResponse` of type `EaseBuzzNotificationResponsetype` and `event` of type `Text`.\n4.  **Missing Field:** The webhook payload received from the gateway does not contain the `event` field, which is expected by the code."

    "Question": "What is the primary consequence of the webhook and sync failures described in the integration issues?",
    "Answer": "Based on the provided documents, the primary consequence is a desynchronization of transaction status between the internal system and the external payment gateways. For instance, in issue EUL-19919, a transaction was marked as `CAPTURED` by the TPSL gateway, but remained in an `AUTHORIZED` state internally because no webhook was received and subsequent sync attempts failed. This incorrect state requires manual intervention to resolve and affects the accuracy of data presented on the dashboard."

It is assigned to Aashish Kumar, the status is `IN_PROGRESS`, and the ETA is November 13.\n2.  **Issue EUL-19919:** This is an `ISSUE` reported by Aryan Tele.
