    "Question": "Based on the document, how does the Q4 plan for Project Phoenix address the problems identified during the Q3 retrospective?",
    "Answer": "The Q4 plan for Project Phoenix addresses the issues from the Q3 retrospective in the following ways:\n1.  **Resource Allocation:** The 'Analytics Dashboard', which was previously under-resourced, has been made the top priority for Q4. The plan explicitly calls for 2 backend engineers and 1 frontend engineer to be allocated to it.\n2.  **Cross-team Communication:** While the Q3 retrospective noted misaligned priorities as an issue, the Q4 plan does not explicitly state a new process for communication. However, it establishes clearer ownership (e.g., Leo Martinez leading the API security audit) and specific action items with deadlines, which can help improve alignment."
