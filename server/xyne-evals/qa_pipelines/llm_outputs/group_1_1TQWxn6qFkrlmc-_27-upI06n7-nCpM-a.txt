    "Answer": "To ensure smooth processing of your financial submissions, you should adhere to the following principles derived from the documents:\n\n1.  **Timeliness:** Submit reimbursement claims within 10 days of receiving the email from the Admin Team or Shankar J. Complete all payroll setup steps by the specified deadline of 26th Aug 2025.\n2.  **Accuracy and Correct Formatting:** Use the specified 'Expense_Month Name & Year' format for reimbursement titles. Ensure that values declared under Flexi components are also declared under IT declaration Section 10.\n3.  **Complete Documentation:** For reimbursements, provide clear, system-generated bills with unique invoice numbers. For bank account updates, provide a mandatory attachment (like a canceled cheque or passbook copy) where all details are clearly visible.\n4.  **Process Completion:** After saving a reimbursement expense, you must also click 'Submit for approval' for it to be processed. Similarly, ensure all mandatory steps for payroll setup are completed.\n5.  **Avoid Clubbing:** Do not club expenses for different months into a single reimbursement request."
