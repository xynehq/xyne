    "Question": "What different solutions and approaches have been discussed to handle varying merchant requirements for configurations and payment data?",
    "Answer": "Several solutions and approaches have been discussed across different conversations:\n1.  **Reseller-level Configurations:** Amit Shukla suggested a solution from the dashboard using reseller<>mid mappings, but questioned if all merchants under a reseller would have the same configuration (doc id: e0d661a8-d86d-4232-b7bc-7095f0c49896).\n2.  **Merchant-specific Config:** Utkarsh Kumar proposed having a merchant config to enable a specific parameter to be passed during mandate status updates (doc id: e27eb064-079e-4cf0-86c1-04aee982179c).\n3.  **Data Consumption from Metadata:** Dharnesh B R suggested convincing the merchant to consume `amount_info` from the existing metadata (doc id: 7c5df058-cd9c-48ed-84c3-79cb3a68799f).\n4.  **Modifying Data Structure:** As an alternative, Dharnesh B R proposed adding the required info as a further split under `BASE` in `txn_amount_breakup` if the merchant doesn't agree to use metadata (doc id: 7c5df058-cd9c-48ed-84c3-79cb3a68799f).\n5.  **Phased Gateway Support for Splits:** Balaji B outlined a two-phase solution where the decider needs context on which gateways support splits. Phase 1 would not send split info to unsupported gateways, and Phase 2 would involve internally calling the `/fulfillment` API for merchants who pass split info to an unsupported gateway (doc id: c5a3c65f-c4d9-4666-bfba-8a67b3e43e95).\n6.  **Configuration for Status:** Aklank mentioned that a merchant can get any status by configuring an amount or using a required VPA (doc id: 84d63a2f-daf9-49d3-bbe6-1f148df9871b)."

    "Question": "Synthesizing the discussions, what is the core recurring problem regarding merchant payment features, and what is the main challenge in implementing a universal solution?",
    "Answer": "Based on the provided messages, the core recurring problem is the need to support merchant-specific behaviors and data requirements within a standardized payment flow. This is evident in discussions about needing specific `amount_info` in order status (doc id: 7c5df058-cd9c-48ed-84c3-79cb3a68799f), passing custom parameters on mandate status (doc id: e27eb064-079e-4cf0-86c1-04aee982179c), and handling payment splits (doc id: c5a3c65f-c4d9-4666-bfba-8a67b3e43e95).\n\nThe main challenge in implementing a universal solution is the diversity of requirements. As Amit Shukla noted, it's uncertain if all reseller merchants will accept the same configuration, as \"Different merchants can have different requirements\" (doc id: e0d661a8-d86d-4232-b7bc-7095f0c49896). Furthermore, the technical capabilities vary, such as different gateways having or lacking support for features like payment splits, which complicates a one-size-fits-all approach and necessitates phased rollouts or context-aware logic (doc id: c5a3c65f-c4d9-4666-bfba-8a67b3e43e95)."
