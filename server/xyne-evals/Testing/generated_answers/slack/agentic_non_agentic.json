The problem occurs because:1. **Missing Authentication Account Configuration**: The merchant `hyperupi` (which appears to be related to `swiggy-nf`) does not have the `YES_BIZ` authentication account properly set up in the system.2. **PSP Mismatch**: When making `/upi/inapp` session params calls, the system is checking for an authentication account for the PSP `YES_BIZ`, but this authentication account is not configured for the merchant in question.3. **Configuration Gap**: Although the dashboard showed that an auth account was configured, there was a gap specifically for the `YES_BIZ` PSP authentication account setup.## Resolution StatusFrom the Slack conversations found, the issue was escalated to the appropriate teams with the following actions:- The issue was raised to be addressed with the merchant (Swiggy) team- The team identified that a `YES_BIZ` authentication account needed to be set up for the merchant- This was escalated to @Surya and @Utkarsh Gupta for merchant configurationHowever, I don't see a definitive confirmation in the current search results that this specific issue has been fully resolved. ## RecommendationTo get the current status of this issue, I recommend:1. Checking the JIRA ticket **EUL-17639** for the latest updates2. Verifying in the merchant dashboard that the `YES_BIZ` authentication account is now properly configured for MID `hyperupi`3. Testing the `/upi/inapp` endpoint again to confirm resolutionThe fix would involve properly configuring the `YES_BIZ` PSP authentication account for the `hyperupi` merchant in the sandbox environment."

    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the context I have, I can see that authentication changes were being tested directly on the sandbox environment rather than locally. Looking at the OAuth2 token expiry mitigation strategy document , there's a specific reason for this approach:The authentication changes were being tested directly on the sandbox environment instead of locally because **the integration required validation against the NPCI sandbox infrastructure**. Specifically, the document states that the changes \"will be deployed to the UAT environment for validation against the NPCI sandbox, using a JMeter script to simulate high-concurrency requests at the point of token expiry\" .This approach was necessary because:1. **External API Dependencies**: The OAuth2 token management fixes needed to be tested against the actual NPCI UPI switch endpoints, which are only accessible through their sandbox environment, not through local development setups.2. **Realistic Network Conditions**: The race condition issues being addressed were related to token expiry timing and concurrent requests, which required testing under realistic network latency and timing conditions that couldn't be replicated locally.3. **Integration Validation**: The fixes involved the `juspay-go-sdk/npci/auth` module interacting with NPCI's authentication infrastructure, requiring end-to-end validation in an environment that mirrors production connectivity .4. **Audit Requirements**: This was identified as \"a critical prerequisite for the upcoming NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit,\" requiring validation in an environment that would satisfy audit requirements for demonstrating \"robust session management and proactive risk mitigation\" .Local testing wouldn't have provided the necessary validation of the authentication flow against the actual NPCI infrastructure that the changes were designed to fix."

    "question": "How can we prevent transactions from failing because they are being synced with the payment gateway before they are initiated?",
    "answer": "The proposed solution is to implement a threshold-based check. This means the system will not sync a transaction for the first 'x' retries or 't' minutes if it has not been initiated. Syncing will only begin after that threshold is passed. This approach is intended to reduce early sync failures while also handling potential system issues like pod crashes. Additionally, it was suggested that if a sync results in the payment gateway reporting 'no order found', the system should not attempt to sync that transaction again.",
    "source_thread_id": "1716811305.791449",
    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the retrieved context, there are several strategies to prevent transactions from failing due to synchronization issues with payment gateways before initiation:## Implement Proactive Token Management**OAuth Token Refresh Strategy**: Implement a proactive token refresh mechanism that refreshes access tokens 90 seconds before expiry and stores them in a shared Redis key, eliminating local credential caching and preventing race conditions . Use a distributed lock with Redis `SETNX` command to ensure only one pod can refresh tokens at a time .**Centralized Authentication**: Store refreshed tokens in a shared Redis cluster (e.g., `npci:auth:token`) so all service instances read from this shared key instead of maintaining local caches .## Fix Routing and Configuration Issues**Correct Payment Routing**: Ensure routing rules properly classify transactions by updating configuration maps like `payment-router-rules.yaml` to include correct MCC ranges and prevent misrouting to wrong gateways . For example, include MCC range `5540-5542` for cross-border transactions in the appropriate gateway profile .**Schema Validation**: Implement automated schema validation in CI/CD pipelines to prevent malformed routing rules from reaching production .## Implement Robust Retry and Circuit Breaker Patterns**Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Deploy client-side adaptive rate limiters using token bucket algorithms with distributed state management in Redis to smooth out request bursts and prevent throttling . Configure circuit breakers to trip after encountering consecutive 429 responses within sliding windows .**Exponential Backoff**: Replace fixed-interval retry logic with exponential backoff strategies incorporating jitter to de-synchronize retry attempts and distribute load more effectively .## Address Settlement and Reconciliation Issues**Transaction State Management**: Introduce intermediate states like `PENDING_RECONCILIATION` for transactions that need verification before finalization . Implement atomic updates to both primary transaction tables and reconciliation logs to guarantee data consistency .**Real-time Status Verification**: For transactions receiving timeout responses (like `U30` codes), implement forced status checks using APIs like NPCI's `getTxnStatus` to verify final transaction states .## Monitor and Alert**Enhanced Monitoring**: Create dedicated Grafana dashboards to monitor circuit breaker states, token refresh success rates, and queue depths for deferred processing . Set up alerts for when error rates exceed acceptable thresholds (e.g., >3% over 60-second windows) .These strategies address the root causes of synchronization failures including token expiry race conditions, routing misconfigurations, rate limiting issues, and settlement discrepancies that can cause transactions to fail before proper initiation.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the available documentation, I can see several patterns related to transaction synchronization issues with payment gateways. Here are the key strategies to prevent transactions from failing due to synchronization problems:## Root Causes and Prevention Strategies### 1. Race Condition in Event ProcessingThe documentation reveals a critical issue where **callback consumers commit transaction states before initial states are fully processed** . This happens when:- The `upi_callback_consumer` service processes async success notifications from NPCI- It commits final 'SUCCESS' status before the initial transaction state is logged by upstream services- This breaks the event-sourcing pattern and creates inconsistent states**Prevention Strategy:**- Implement **atomic state transitions** in your event processing architecture- Ensure the callback consumer publishes a `txn_status_finalized` event to a dedicated Kafka topic- Create an idempotent consumer service that atomically updates both primary payments table and reconciliation logs ### 2. OAuth Token Race ConditionsAnother common synchronization issue occurs with **OAuth token refresh cycles** :- Multiple service pods independently detect expiring tokens- Concurrent refresh requests cause NPCI to invalidate all but one token- Other pods cache stale credentials, leading to subsequent API failures**Prevention Strategy:**- Implement **distributed locking using Redis** with `SETNX` commands- Centralize token refresh logic so only one pod can acquire the refresh lock- Store refreshed tokens in shared Redis keys that all instances read from- Set appropriate lock TTLs (15 seconds) to prevent deadlocks ### 3. Asynchronous Status VerificationFor transactions experiencing gateway timeouts, implement **delayed status confirmation** :- For transactions with 'T707 - Gateway Await Timeout' errors- Trigger asynchronous `ReqTxnConfirmation` API calls after a cooling-off period (60 minutes)- Add `final_status_source` field to track state origin ('RespPay' vs. 'TxnConfirmation')### 4. Pre-emptive State ManagementTo prevent sync issues in multi-currency transactions :- **Pre-fetch and cache critical data** (like FX rates) during transaction synchronization- Store alongside transaction payload in Redis cache- Avoid post-facto lookups during settlement windows that can cause state mismatches### 5. Circuit Breaker PatternsImplement **Resilience4j-based circuit breakers** to prevent cascading failures:- Configure to trip when error rates exceed thresholds (3% over 60-second windows)- Prioritize critical payment initializations over status checks- Use dedicated Kafka topics for deferred processing when circuits are open## Implementation Recommendations1. **Atomic Transactions**: Ensure all state changes are atomic across your payment processing pipeline2. **Distributed Coordination**: Use Redis-based locking for shared resources like tokens3. **Async Verification**: Implement delayed confirmation mechanisms for timeout scenarios4. **Pre-caching**: Cache critical data early in the transaction lifecycle5. **Monitoring**: Set up comprehensive monitoring for race conditions and sync failuresThese strategies address the core synchronization challenges identified in your payment gateway architecture and should significantly reduce transaction failures due to timing issues."

    "question": "Why are sync tasks scheduled without waiting for the transaction initiation call to be made first?",
    "answer": "Sync tasks are scheduled agnostically of the initiation call to handle potential system failures. This is a safeguard in case a pod crashes after the initiation call is made but before the database status has been reliably updated. In that scenario, the scheduled sync is necessary to reconcile the transaction's status.",
    "source_thread_id": "1716811305.791449",
    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the retrieved context, I can see multiple instances of OAuth token refresh failures and API timeout issues that suggest synchronization problems, but there isn't specific information about sync tasks being scheduled without waiting for transaction initiation calls.The context shows several related technical issues that might be connected to your question:**OAuth Token Refresh Timing Issues:**- Multiple reports of OAuth 2.0 token refresh failures occurring before transaction calls complete - Systems experiencing `invalid_grant` errors when refresh tokens are used prematurely - Token refresh attempts timing out after configured thresholds (1500ms-3000ms) **API Call Sequencing Problems:**- Services receiving `401 Unauthorized` responses followed by failed token refresh attempts - Cascading failures where authentication issues cause downstream API timeouts - Circuit breaker patterns being implemented to handle these sequencing issues **Settlement and Reconciliation Timing:**- Issues with settlement batch jobs running before transaction status is finalized - Reconciliation services experiencing timing mismatches between transaction completion and status updates However, the specific architectural details about why sync tasks are scheduled without waiting for transaction initiation calls aren't explicitly documented in the available context. This could be related to the OAuth token management issues or settlement timing problems mentioned above, but I'd need more specific technical documentation to provide a definitive answer about the sync task scheduling logic.",

However, I can provide insights from related scenarios:## Identified Synchronization IssuesFrom the documentation, there are several instances where timing and sequencing of tasks create problems:### 1. Race Conditions in Event ProcessingThe analysis of UPI Settlement Mismatch reveals a critical race condition where:- The `upi_callback_consumer` service commits final 'SUCCESS' status to the database **before** the initial `U30` transaction state has been fully processed- This circumvents the intended event-sourcing pattern because state changes aren't atomically reflected in reconciliation staging tables### 2. Async Processing Without Proper DependenciesIn the forex rate caching implementation , there's a similar pattern where:- The system performs offline transaction synchronization via `syncOfflineTxns` endpoint- FX rates are cached at sync time rather than waiting for the actual transaction initiation- This creates a timing mismatch where rates may be stale by the time transactions are actually processed### 3. Token Management Scheduling IssuesThe ICICI OAuth refresh problem shows another example where:- Background tasks are scheduled (token refresh every 15 minutes) without proper coordination with actual API call timing- This leads to authentication failures when the scheduled refresh doesn't align with actual usage patterns## Root Cause PatternThe underlying issue appears to be **lack of proper dependency management** in the task scheduling system. Tasks are being scheduled based on time intervals or external triggers rather than waiting for prerequisite operations to complete.Would you be able to provide more specific details about:1. Which particular sync tasks you're referring to?2. What type of transaction initiation calls should be happening first?3. Any specific error codes or system components involved?This would help me search for more targeted information about your specific use case."

Here's what's happening:1. **Missing Configuration in Sandbox**: The `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` configuration was not properly released/deployed in the sandbox environment [referenced in Slack message].2. **Scheduler Bypass Logic**: Because this configuration is missing in sandbox, the system is incorrectly skipping the scheduler process, even though the merchant (`tvsmotor`) should be processed through the normal refund scheduling flow.3. **ProcessTracker Issue**: The refund was added to ProcessTracker but is not being executed properly due to the configuration mismatch between what the code expects and what's actually deployed in sandbox.## Additional ContextThere's also a separate API flow issue with CCAvenue that's worth noting:- CCAvenue returns a \"Success\" response for refund initiation requests, but the actual refund status needs to be checked via the `getRefundDetails` API call- This creates a discrepancy where the system thinks the refund succeeded when it may still be pending## Immediate Solutions1. **Deploy Missing Config**: Ensure the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` configuration is properly deployed to the sandbox environment2. **Add Merchant to Config**: If instant refunds are desired, add `tvsmotor` to the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` list3. **Check ProcessTracker**: Debug why ProcessTracker isn't executing the scheduled refunds even when they're added to the queue4. **Verify Scheduler Service**: Ensure the refund scheduler service is running properly in sandbox and can process the `refund_sync_frequency_intervals` (currently set to 300 seconds/5 minutes)The JIRA ticket **EUL-18115** has been created to track this issue. This is indeed a blocker for the merchant's go-live, so immediate attention to the configuration deployment in sandbox is needed."

    "model_answer_non_agentic": "The `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` flag was actually tested for TVS Motor but it didn't resolve their issue . According to the analysis, even after enabling TVS Motor on this configuration, the problem persisted because of how CCAvenue handles refund responses .The core issue is that CCAvenue returns a Success Response at the API level for refund requests, but the actual status of the refund is only available when calling `getRefundDetails` . This means that even with instant execution enabled, the system was still showing success based on the initial API response rather than the true refund status .Due to this continuing issue, TVS Motor was actually removed from the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` configuration, but the system is still initiating refunds directly to CCAvenue and giving a SUCCESS response . The team identified that they need to modify the flow to call `getRefundDetails` after refund initiation to get the actual status of the refund .So simply enabling the flag isn't sufficient - the integration needs to be updated to properly handle CCAvenue's two-step response pattern where the real refund status comes from a separate API call.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the Slack conversations I found, I can now explain why simply enabling the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` flag for TVS Motor doesn't fix their refund issue:## The TVS Motor Refund Issue and Why the Flag Doesn't Fix ItThe problem with TVS Motor's refund flow via CCAvenue is **not just about timing or scheduling** - it's a fundamental issue with how CCAvenue's API behaves:### The Core Issue:1. **CCAvenue's misleading API response**: When a refund request is made to CCAvenue, they return a \"Success\" response immediately, but this is just an API acknowledgment, not the actual refund status.2. **Actual refund status is asynchronous**: The real refund status is only available through a separate `getRefundDetails` API call, which needs to be made after the initial refund request.### Why the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` Flag Doesn't Help:Even when TVS Motor was added to the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` flag (which bypasses the scheduler and processes refunds immediately), **the issue persisted** because:- The flag only changes **when** the refund is processed, not **how** the refund status is determined- CCAvenue still returns the same misleading \"Success\" response regardless of timing- The system still needs to make the additional `getRefundDetails` call to get the actual refund status### What Actually Needs to Be Fixed:The solution requires **modifying the refund flow** to:1. Make the initial refund request to CCAvenue2. **Immediately follow up** with a `getRefundDetails` call to get the actual refund status3. Use the status from `getRefundDetails` (not the initial API response) to determine if the refund was successful### Current Status:- TVS Motor has been **removed** from the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` configuration- The system is currently giving a \"SUCCESS\" response based on CCAvenue's misleading initial response- This creates a poor user experience because users think the refund succeeded when it may have actually failedThe fix requires a code change to the refund processing logic, not just a configuration flag change."

For example, document describes how weak cipher suites like `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA` can cause handshake failures and recommends using modern cipher suites like `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`.## Recommended Resolution1. **Check TLS Configuration**: Verify that both the client (Juspay) and SIMPL's API endpoint are using compatible TLS versions and cipher suites.2. **Header Normalization**: Ensure that the request headers being sent to SIMPL match the successful pattern - remove or adjust the additional headers (`Content-Type`, `x-art-recording`, `Accept`) that appear in failed requests.3. **SSL/TLS Debugging**: Enable detailed SSL debugging to identify the exact point of handshake failure.4. **Cipher Suite Alignment**: Work with SIMPL's technical team to ensure cipher suite compatibility, similar to the ICICI Bank coordination mentioned in document .The issue is currently being tracked and has been escalated to @Mariyam and @Richa for resolution ."

    "question": "The merchant TimesPrime is facing issues with their LOYLTY Rewards integration in the sandbox environment. For one test card (4242...8007), the redeem option isn't appearing due to a 'Missing Mandatory Params PROGRAM_CODE' error. For another card (4357...4343), the redeem option appears but points are not deducted. What were the root causes and resolutions for these problems?",
    "answer": "The issues were diagnosed and addressed as follows:\n\n1.  **Card ending in 8007 (Missing Redeem Option):** The initial 'Missing Mandatory Params PROGRAM_CODE' error occurred because the corresponding `program_code` was not present in the sandbox database. The Loylty team provided the code ('YES DC'), which was then added. This led to a subsequent issue where the system incorrectly validated the 6-digit BIN as a US card. A fix for this was pushed to CUG. However, the latest error reported from the Loylty gateway for this card is 'Member Profile Not Found'.\n\n2.  **Card ending in 4343 (Points Not Deducted):** The failure to deduct points was caused by the Loylty 'fetch Balance' API timing out. The Loylty team suggested this might have been due to infrastructure changes on their end and asked to retry. A separate 'Invalid Client Auth Token' error was also encountered on the payment page; this was attributed to testing via Postman without passing a `customerId` in the `/cards/balance` API call.",

When checking the `/cards/balance` call, it returned the error \"Missing Mandatory Params PROGRAM_CODE\" because no outgoing call was being made to the LOYLTY Gateway . The Bin Info API showed `\"reward_supported\": false` and `\"reward_support_gateways\": []` for this card .**Technical Details:** The system wasn't recognizing this test card as eligible for LOYLTY rewards, so the \"Use Reward points to pay Redeem now\" option wasn't appearing on the payment page .## Problem 2: Test Card 4357083333374343 - Points Not Deducting**Root Cause:** There were two issues identified :1. **Missing Program Code:** For the corresponding program code `5278GHBM3806JJUW2267`, the program_code was not present in the sandbox database, causing the \"Missing Mandatory Params PROGRAM_CODE\" error .2. **API Performance Issues:** The fetch balance API was experiencing response timeouts due to high latency from the payment gateway side, with response times exceeding 10 seconds on first calls and around 5 seconds on subsequent calls .## Additional Context**Authentication Issues:** While the redeem option appeared for the second card when tested via Postman (returning successful balance response), the payment page showed authorization errors with `\"error_code\":\"access_denied\"` and `\"developer_message\":\"Invalid Client Auth Token or signature\"` . However, other API calls like SavedPaymentMethods were working fine with the same client_auth_token, indicating a specific issue with the balance API authentication .**Resolution Status:** The team was working on fixes for the missing program codes in the sandbox database and investigating the API timeout and authentication issues .",

    "question": "Why would I be getting an 'Invalid Client Auth Token or signature' error when calling the /cards/balance API, even if other API calls are working with the same token?",
    "answer": "Based on the discussion, this error occurs because the `/cards/balance` API call is being made without required linking data, such as a `customerId`, associated with the client auth token. This situation is particularly common when testing via an API client like Postman, where the token is sent without the context of a customer or order ID.",

    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the context, you're getting an 'Invalid Client Auth Token or signature' error on the `/cards/balance` API because **you're not passing linking data like customerId along with the client auth token** .According to the Slack discussion, this error occurs specifically \"because against the client auth token, we're not passing any linking data like customerId\" . The solution is to **pass customer id and check again** .Additionally, another team member confirmed that this response \"will come only in case of invalid auth\" , and there's mention that for signature-based merchants, \"you are getting this error because you are testing via postman and loading PP in which case clientauthtoken is being sent without either of customer id/order id/wallet id\" .So while your token might be valid for other APIs, the `/cards/balance` endpoint specifically requires additional linking data (customerId, orderId, or walletId) to be passed along with the client auth token to properly authenticate and authorize the request.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the available context and the authentication issues documented in your systems , here are the most likely causes for the \"Invalid Client Auth Token or signature\" error specifically on the `/cards/balance` API while other APIs work:## Potential Root Causes:### 1. **Endpoint-Specific Token Scopes or Permissions**The `/cards/balance` API may require different OAuth scopes or permissions compared to other APIs. Even with a valid token, it might lack the specific authorization scope needed for card balance queries.### 2. **API-Specific Signature Requirements**Based on the OAuth issues documented in your system , some endpoints may have different signature validation requirements:- The `/cards/balance` endpoint might require additional headers or a different signature algorithm- It could be validating the token signature against a different certificate or key### 3. **Token Expiry Race Conditions**Similar to the issues documented with ICICI integrations , there may be a race condition where:- Your token is near expiry and other APIs are more tolerant of slightly expired tokens- The `/cards/balance` API has stricter token validation timing### 4. **Caching Issues**From the token management problems described , consider:- Stale tokens cached specifically for card-related operations- Redis cache inconsistencies where the cached token for cards APIs is different from other services## Immediate Troubleshooting Steps:1. **Check Token Scopes**: Verify your OAuth token includes the necessary scopes for card balance operations2. **Force Token Refresh**: Clear any cached tokens and request a fresh one specifically for the cards API3. **Review Headers**: Ensure all required headers (Content-Type, Authorization, any custom headers) are identical to working API calls4. **Check Token Timing**: Verify the token hasn't expired and has sufficient time remaining5. **Validate Signature Method**: Confirm the signature algorithm and any client certificates are correctly configured for the cards serviceWould you be able to share the specific error response details or check your token scopes to help narrow down the exact cause?"

    "answer": "The mandate failed to retry due to a sequence of issues. Initially, the transaction did not process correctly because the merchant needed to be added to the `schedule_level_mandate_execution_enabled_merchants` configuration in the sandbox environment. After this was fixed, a subsequent retry attempt failed because the GSM check returned an error: \"User doesn't have sufficient balance in the account | Retarget_payment is not enabled by the merchant.\" A final attempt failed because the grace period for retrying had expired, as the grace period starts from the time of the initial transaction execution.",

Here's what's happening:### Primary Issue: Missing Gateway Status Mapping1. **Configuration Gap**: Your mandate execution is likely going through the HYPER_PG gateway, but there's a missing Gateway Status Mapping (GSM) entry for handling 'pending' notification responses .2. **System Behavior**: When the gateway responds with a 'pending' status, Juspay's system cannot interpret this response due to the missing GSM configuration, causing the workflow to become stuck waiting for a system-level state transition .3. **No Retry Trigger**: Since the system doesn't recognize the 'pending' response, it doesn't trigger the retry mechanism, even though you've enabled retries on the dashboard .### Technical Details- The notification framework uses an explicit NotificationStatus state machine in Juspay's codebase (Euler) - The GatewayStatusMap mapping logic determines how external gateway responses are converted to system states - Without a matching GSM entry for the 'pending' response, the transition never completes, causing indefinite stalling ### Secondary Issues (from related cases)From similar recent cases, there are also broader issues with mandate execution:1. **HYPER_PG Gateway Support Gap**: The notification logic (`syncNotificationForMandateV2`) only implements support for RBL_BIZ gateway, with HYPER_PG defaulting to a `GATEWAY_NOT_SUPPORTED` path 2. **Missing PDN Implementation**: For HYPER_PG, there's no Pre-Debit Notification (PDN) pipeline, which is required for mandate execution ## Immediate Actions Required### For Your Specific Case:1. **GSM Configuration Fix**: The engineering team needs to insert a GSM entry for HYPER_PG 'pending' state mapped to JuspayStatus 'Pending' for mandate flows 2. **Manual Intervention**: This requires internal Juspay configuration changes - no merchant action can resolve this### Broader System Fixes Needed:1. Implement notification creation and tracking logic for HYPER_PG within `syncNotificationForMandateV2` 2. Add configuration flag `HYPER_PG_MANDATE_NOTIFICATION_ENABLED` for affected merchants 3. Create HYPER_PG-specific notification retry and timeout policies ## EscalationThis is a **critical production-blocking issue** affecting all HYPER_PG UPI mandates. Similar cases show 0% success rates for mandate executions using this gateway configuration . The issue requires immediate attention from the engineering team to resolve the GSM configuration gap.You should escalate this to the technical team with reference to the specific order ID (203745493720) and merchant ID (sangam) to get the missing GSM configuration added."

    "question": "How is the grace period for mandate retries calculated? Does it start from the time of the retry failure?",
    "answer": "The grace period for a mandate retry starts from the time of the initial transaction execution, not from the time of the retry failure. If the execution is delayed, a retry may not be possible if it falls outside this grace period.",
    "source_thread_id": "1737616675.104799",

Retry feature not supported.\" This indicates that the system checks whether the current date has exceeded the grace period calculated from the retry failure date, and if so, it blocks further retry attempts.This grace period calculation appears to be part of the mandate retry logic that determines whether retry functionality is still available for a given mandate based on how much time has passed since the initial retry failure occurred.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the available context fragments, I can provide information about grace periods and retry mechanisms, though the specific calculation details for mandate retry grace periods are limited in the current documents.From the context, here's what I can tell you about grace periods and retries:## Grace Period ConfigurationThe system uses a `grace_period_ms` configuration parameter. In one case mentioned, there's a **35,000ms (35 second) grace period** configured in the reconciliation service . However, this appears to be insufficient for catching certain edge cases before marking transactions as settled.## Retry Mechanisms and TimingThe documents show several retry strategies being implemented:1. **Exponential Backoff with Jitter**: For handling HTTP 429 responses, the system implements exponential backoff strategies with initial intervals like 500ms and multipliers of 1.5 .2. **Fixed Interval Retries**: Some services use fixed-interval retry policies (e.g., 3 attempts at 500ms intervals) , though this approach is being replaced due to creating \"thundering herd\" effects.3. **Delayed Status Checks**: For certain transaction types, the system triggers delayed confirmation API calls after a 60-minute cooling-off period .## Mandate-Specific ContextFor mandate operations, there are references to:- Mandate creation API rate limiting issues - OAuth2 token refresh failures affecting mandate reporting - Retry strategies specifically for mandate-related failuresHowever, the specific calculation of when the grace period starts for mandate retries (whether from initial failure or retry failure) is not explicitly detailed in the available documents.**To get the exact calculation details you're looking for**, you may need to:1.

This has been reported for merchant ID `adityabirla_sunlife` in the production environment.## Root Cause AnalysisBased on the Slack discussion in the one-team channel , this appears to be a **data inconsistency issue** where:1. **Summary Count Logic**: The summary count (showing 15) is using one query/filter criteria for counting orders with \"Unknown\" payment gateway2. **Detailed List Logic**: The detailed list view is using different query parameters or filters, resulting in more records being displayed3. **Mixed Order Status**: The investigation shows that orders with various statuses (success, authorization failed, etc.) are appearing under the same \"Unknown\" gateway category ## Technical Investigation FindingsThe issue shows that:- Orders are being incorrectly categorized or filtered when displaying the summary count vs. the detailed list- There may be a **query parameter mismatch** between the summary aggregation and the list view API calls- Different payment gateway classifications are getting grouped together inappropriately## Similar Known IssuesThis appears related to other gateway classification problems in the system, such as:- **Settlement discrepancies** where transactions are processed through one gateway but show up under another - **Silent retry scenarios** where failed transactions on one gateway get retried on another, but the dashboard continues to show the original gateway [mentioned in related discussions]## Immediate Actions NeededThe engineering team should:1. **Compare API endpoints**: Check the exact curl/API calls being made for the summary count vs. the detailed list view2. **Query parameter analysis**: Verify that both views are using identical filter criteria for \"Unknown\" payment gateway3. **Database consistency check**: Ensure the payment gateway field is correctly populated and consistently referenced across both queriesThis is a critical dashboard accuracy issue that affects merchant trust and should be prioritized for immediate investigation and resolution."

    "question": "What is the logic of the 'sample modal' for orders, and why does it show a different number of records than the summary count?",
    "answer": "The 'sample modal' does not show a real-time count but rather a sample of up to 100 orders. The discrepancy with the summary count occurs because the modal incorrectly combines both 'orders_with_transaction' and 'new orders' (orders without a transaction), whereas the summary count only includes 'orders_with_transaction'.",
    "source_thread_id": "1718277739.045289",
    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the Slack conversation, the 'sample modal' logic works as follows:The sample modal doesn't show the real count - it just displays a sample of 100 orders if there are more than 100 orders . This sample includes both:- New orders (without transactions)- Orders which have transactions The discrepancy occurs because:1. **Sample Modal Count**: Shows orders_with_transaction + new orders (up to 100 as a sample) 2. **Summary Table Count**: Shows metrics only for orders with transactions and doesn't include new orders So if you see 15 orders in the UI, those are specifically the orders for which transactions have been created . The sample modal shows a broader set that includes both transaction orders and new orders, while the summary table is filtered to only show orders that have associated transactions .This explains why there's a difference between the number of orders_with_transaction shown versus the number of sample orders displayed in the sample modal .",

The `upi-common-library` has a race condition during NPCI OAuth token refresh cycles, where multiple Kubernetes pods independently detect expiring tokens and initiate refresh requests concurrently . This causes NPCI's token endpoint to invalidate all but one of the new tokens, leaving other pods with stale credentials.**Mitigation Strategy**: The proposed solution involves implementing a distributed lock using Redis with `SETNX` commands to ensure only a single pod can refresh tokens. The winning pod will refresh tokens 90 seconds before expiry and update shared Redis keys for other instances to use .## Configuration Management Problems**Cross-Border Routing Misconfiguration**: The HyperSwitch routing engine experienced a critical misconfiguration in the `bin_routing_rules.yaml` file, where static rules failed to exclude new Singaporean BIN ranges, causing incorrect routing of international transactions . This resulted in approximately 850 transactions being incorrectly processed through domestic endpoints.**Remediation**: A hotfix deployment of updated `bin_routing_rules.v1.6.yaml` with more specific regex patterns was implemented, along with plans to integrate an external BIN database API to replace static rule files with dynamic lookups .## Service-Specific Deployment Issues**KYC Processing Timeouts**: The `kyc-processor` service is experiencing cascading failures when handling high-risk customer segments, with critical Kafka consumer lag exceeding 10,000 messages due to insufficient HTTP client timeout configurations (3000ms) for ICICI Bank's CKYC API .**Rate Limiting Problems**: Services are facing persistent HTTP 429 responses from external APIs, requiring implementation of adaptive rate limiters using token bucket algorithms and exponential backoff strategies .## Infrastructure Configuration Issues**Redis Cache Contention**: The Sentinel risk-scoring engine experienced P99 latency spikes from ~80ms to >350ms due to Redis cache misses caused by incorrect `allkeys-lru` eviction policy configuration . The solution involves switching to `volatile-lfu` eviction policy and implementing tiered caching strategies.**PCI Compliance Violations**: Multiple services have configuration issues leading to PCI DSS violations, including unmasked PAN data in Kafka topics and weak TLS cipher suites in Nginx Ingress Controllers .These issues highlight the need for better centralized configuration management, improved deployment validation processes, and more robust service mesh configurations to handle authentication and rate limiting challenges.",

Currently, when a 5xx response is received from the Pinelabs gateway with a generic error message like \"An error has occurred,\" the refund status is being updated as **failure** at Juspay's end . However, this is problematic because in many cases, the first refund was actually processed successfully at the gateway level .This handling has led to several concerning scenarios:## Specific Issues Identified:1. **False Failure Status**: Refunds are being marked as failed when they were actually successful at the gateway 2. **Duplicate Refunds**: When merchants retry refunds believing the initial attempt failed, all subsequent attempts fail since the full amount had already been refunded 3. **Partial Refund Risk**: For partial refunds, merchants could unintentionally initiate duplicate refunds due to this incorrect failure handling ## Current Impact:For example, with merchant `pharmeasytech`, there were cases where:- **Order ID: 0027820382**: 8 refund attempts were made, with 7 showing as failed on Juspay dashboard and 1 successful, but Pinelabs confirmed all 8 attempts were actually successful - **Order ID: 0027824429**: 4 attempts were made with 3 showing as failed, but all were confirmed successful by Pinelabs ## Recommended Solution:The current procedure should be updated so that **refunds with 5xx response codes in refund syncs are kept in 'pending' status instead of being marked as 'failure'** .

    "answer": "The plan is to identify all gateway response fields that are marked as mandatory but are not actually used in the code, and then refactor them to be optional (`Maybe`). Sandeep Reddy is leading this effort and has already extracted the unused field data from `api-txns` and `api-gateway`. He is now writing the logic to filter this data. The technical approach involves a 'code-as-data' traversal to find usage patterns. However, there is a noted risk that making a field optional could alter the `fromJSON` decoding sequence, potentially breaking deserialization for certain data types.",

    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the discussion in the team channel, there is a plan to address the recurring decode errors caused by unused mandatory fields in gateway responses . The proposed solution involves:**Identification Phase:**- Use code-as-data analysis and LLM technology to identify all gateway response type fields that are marked as mandatory but are not referenced anywhere in the codebase - Focus on fields that are required by gateways but not actually used by the application logic **Remediation Approach:**- Mark the identified unused mandatory fields as \"Maybe\" (optional) instead of mandatory - This would prevent decode errors when gateways update their responses or when certain fields are marked mandatory unnecessarily **Technical Implementation:**- Leverage automated code analysis tools combined with LLM capabilities to systematically review the codebase - The team members @sandeep reddy, @Divyanshu Varshney, @ag, and @Eswar are involved in this effort The root cause of these decode errors is that gateways sometimes update their responses or mark certain fields as mandatory when they shouldn't be, causing the application's decode logic to fail when these unused fields are missing or have unexpected values .",

    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the retrieved context, I can see several code patterns and field usage detection scenarios across different systems:## Database Field Usage Patterns**Connection Pool Monitoring**: The Sentinel Risk Engine experienced latency spikes due to ScyllaDB connection pool exhaustion, where the `scylla_connection_wait_time_ms` metric was used to detect thread contention . The `scylla.db.connection.pool.max_size` parameter was monitored and adjusted from 250 to 400 connections .**Query Pattern Detection**: Inefficient query patterns were identified in the risk scoring engine, where multiple sequential database lookups were detected instead of batched operations . The system monitors `ReadIOPS` saturation on Aurora PostgreSQL read replicas .## API Field Validation Patterns**Missing Field Detection**: Several instances show systems detecting missing or null fields:- The `beneficiary_country` field being populated as null in cross-border payment payloads - Missing `device_fingerprint` and `user_risk_score` fields causing HTTP 422 errors - The `enhanced_monitoring_flag` and `transaction_risk_score` fields causing routing parameter errors **Field Format Validation**: PAN masking patterns are implemented using `6x 4x` format (e.g., `454545XXXXXX4545`) , with regex patterns for cardholder data detection before tokenization .## Configuration Drift Detection**Parameter Monitoring**: The Flink job configuration drift was detected through the `slidingWindow.interval` parameter change . Circuit breaker patterns using Resilience4j are implemented to detect API rate limiting with error code `J_EXT_THROTTLED` .## Fraud Model Field Analysis**Feature Vector Analysis**: The fraud detection models monitor specific field patterns:- `device_freshness_score` over-weighting detection - `device_first_seen` field sensitivity for LITE X accounts - Transaction velocity and history field cross-referencing across `transaction_history`, `device_fingerprints`, and `merchant_velocity` tables ## Error Code Pattern DetectionSystems track various error codes and field-related failures:- `FRD_801` (Anomalous Velocity) for false positives - `FLAG_REASON_CODE: 701` for velocity check mismatches - `GW-RL-003` for API quota exceeded scenarios These patterns suggest comprehensive field usage monitoring across payment processing, fraud detection, and compliance systems.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the available context from your technical documents, I can see several specific code patterns that are being used to determine if fields are actually being used:## Field Detection Patterns**1. Regex Pattern Matching for Sensitive Data**From the PCI DSS remediation documents , your team implements:- **Predefined regex patterns** for cardholder data detection before log events are written- **Field matching patterns** that identify sensitive fields like `pan_last4` in production logs- **Custom data masking filters** that utilize regex to obfuscate fields matching specific patterns**2. JSON Payload Field Inspection**Several documents show patterns for detecting field usage in JSON structures:- **Field-specific matching** like `payment_details.card_number` field within JSON payloads - **Object-level detection** where entire `payment_details` objects are identified and processed- **Nested field patterns** for complex JSON structures in API responses**3. Database Field Usage Detection**From the technical implementations described:- **Schema field tracking** where new fields like `final_status_source` are added with clear audit trails - **Field correlation analysis** across multiple database tables (`transaction_history`, `device_fingerprints`, `merchant_velocity`) - **Cross-reference patterns** that identify which fields are actively queried in complex multi-join operations**4. Configuration-Based Detection**The documents show patterns for:- **Configuration drift detection** using tools like Conftest to validate field usage in Helm charts - **Parameter validation** patterns that check for field presence and usage in service configurations- **Feature flag patterns** that control which fields are actively processed**5. Log Analysis Patterns**- **String pattern monitoring** like alerts configured to detect specific field names (`pan_last4`) in logs - **Field redaction patterns** that identify sensitive fields (`deviceFingerprint`, `vpaHandle`) before Kafka publication - **Audit trail patterns** that track field access and modification across servicesThese patterns suggest your organization uses a combination of static analysis tools, runtime monitoring, and configuration validation to determine actual field usage across your payment processing infrastructure."

First, to fix early sync failures, a custom PT sync frequency was created for SBI (`PT_TXN_SYNC_FREQUENCY_MAPPINGS_SBI`) and set to 10 minutes. Second, to handle the redirection response correctly, mandatory sync was enabled for the SBI gateway by adding it to the `sync_enabled_gateway_for_redirection` and `authentication_failed_enabled_sync_gateways` configurations.",

To resolve this, they requested a customized PT (Payment Transaction) sync frequency specifically for SBI gateway, starting from 300 seconds (5 minutes) instead of the default 90 seconds .**Resolution for Sync Check on Redirection:**Regarding the mandatory sync check issue, it was confirmed that the SBI gateway wasn't enabled under the `sync_enabled_gateway_for_redirection` config . However, team member Pankhudi Jain clarified that most gateways don't rely on this config and automatically perform sync directly . The team needed to check the specific gateway implementation for SBI to confirm whether this configuration change would suffice or if the config wasn't being considered for the gateway implementation itself .The issues were tracked with order IDs ORD091224000145 and ORD091224000027 for merchant ID 'ccil' in the production environment, and the resolution was being coordinated through JIRA ticket EUL-14446 .",

Here's what was identified and resolved:## Resolution for SBI Gateway Sync IssuesThe SBI gateway sync issues involved two main problems and their corresponding resolutions:### **Issue 1: Missing Sync Check on Redirection****Problem**: The system wasn't performing a mandatory sync check with the SBI gateway upon receiving a redirection response. The gateway wasn't enabled under the config `sync_enabled_gateway_for_redirection`.**Resolution**: - Enabled the gateway under the `sync_enabled_gateway_for_redirection` configuration- Enabled the gateway for the config `authentication_failed_enabled_sync_gateways` to allow syncing for failed cases### **Issue 2: Early Sync Failures****Problem**: The system was performing PT (Payment Transaction) sync within 2 minutes of initiation. However, the SBI gateway tends to give a failure response if synced before the first 5 minutes of transaction creation on their end. The default `PT_TXN_SYNC_FREQUENCY_MAPPINGS` config had sync starting after 90 seconds, which was too early for SBI.**Resolution**: - Increased the PT sync frequency for SBI specifically to 10 minutes (600 seconds) instead of the default 90 seconds- This was later refined to start syncing after 5 minutes and 30 seconds (330 seconds) to ensure syncing happens after redirection response### **Additional Issues and Resolutions**The team also identified and resolved several related problems:1. **Invalid Reference Number Handling**: Added support in code for GSM (Gateway State Management) handling to keep transactions with \"Invalid Reference Number\" error messages as Pending for a threshold before moving to Authorization Failed2. **Order and Transaction Status Mismatch**: Fixed issues where transaction status was being overwritten from Failed to Pending due to incorrect handling of `v2/pay/response`3. **Force Sync Implementation**: Enabled mandatory sync so the system could consume status responses during `v2/pay/response`These changes were implemented to prevent failure-to-success cases and ensure proper transaction status synchronization between Juspay's system and the SBI gateway.The resolution was tracked under JIRA ticket EUL-14446 and involved immediate fixes to handle the urgency of the issue while identifying areas for longer-term code improvements."

This caused the CRED ↔ Swiggy success rate to drop to 0% starting from 3:45 PM on the day the issue was reported .**The Problem:**From the Slack alert, it appears that Juspay's system was rejecting successful order webhooks from CRED payment gateway when they were destined for Swiggy's merchant ID. The alert shows a sample successful transaction payload with:- Status: \"OK\" - State: \"COMPLETED\"- Amount: ₹168- Payment method: UPI- Tracking ID: \"com.swiggy-221930100000243-1\"However, despite CRED indicating these transactions were successful, Juspay's webhook processing system was rejecting them, causing the success rate to drop to zero .**Resolution:**While the search results don't show the exact technical resolution steps, the pattern from similar webhook issues in the system suggests the resolution likely involved:1. **Investigation of webhook validation logic** - The system was likely applying incorrect validation rules to CRED's webhook format for the specific Swiggy MID2. **Configuration fixes** - Adjustments to merchant-specific webhook processing rules3. **Merchant ID mapping corrections** - Ensuring proper routing of CRED webhooks to the correct Swiggy merchant configurationThe alert was escalated to the engineering team for immediate investigation and resolution, as indicated by the `<!subteam^S01HMM1KV53>` tag in the Slack message .Unfortunately, the search results don't contain the follow-up messages showing the exact technical root cause or the specific steps taken to resolve the issue.

    "answer": "Mandatory sync is necessary because the incoming webhook requests do not contain a checksum or any other type of hash for validation.",
    "source_thread_id": "1738856307.508469",
    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the retrieved context, mandatory sync is a requirement for webhooks due to several critical reasons:**Error Handling and Data Integrity:**Mandatory sync is essential because webhooks can fail or be rejected, and the sync process provides the actual error information needed for proper handling . When mandatory sync fails, the webhook is also rejected to maintain data consistency .**Reliable Transaction Status:**For successful transactions, webhooks may not always provide complete information. The sync process ensures that Payment Gateway Records (PGR) are created based on the actual transaction status rather than just webhook data, as auth codes are sometimes only available through sync for certain cases .**System Reliability:**Webhooks are not always reliable - they can be encrypted (making them difficult to process) , may not be consumed properly , or may fail entirely . Mandatory sync provides a fallback mechanism to ensure transaction data is properly captured and processed.**Compliance and Audit Requirements:**The sync process helps maintain complete audit trails and ensures that transaction states are accurately reflected in the system, which is crucial for regulatory compliance and settlement processes.The mandatory sync requirement essentially serves as a safety net to ensure data completeness and accuracy when webhook-based communication fails or provides incomplete information.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the documentation I found, mandatory sync is a requirement for webhooks primarily due to **regulatory compliance and audit requirements**. Here are the key reasons:## NPCI Data Localization MandateThe primary driver for mandatory sync in webhooks is **NPCI's data localization mandate for UPI International transactions** . Your organization must eliminate batch-based polling mechanisms that introduce settlement latency and potential data residency gaps.## Real-Time Settlement RequirementsThe current batch-based approach (cron job querying forex partner's API every 15 minutes) introduces **settlement latency of up to T+900 seconds** . This violates NPCI's requirements for:- **Instantaneous event data capture** within India-based infrastructure- **Real-time webhook-based systems** that ensure event data is captured immediately upon successful currency conversion ## Audit Trail and ComplianceMandatory sync ensures:- **Complete and immutable audit trails** for NPCI review through direct logging to append-only audit tables - **Data consistency guarantees** by providing robust, auditable records for every transaction state change, satisfying RBI requirements - **P99 latency targets** under 150ms for settlement acknowledgement ## Technical ImplementationThe sync requirement is implemented through:- **Decoupled confirmation events** from final database writes using dedicated Kafka topics- **Atomic updates** to both primary payments tables and reconciliation logs- **Failure monitoring** with specific timeout codes (like `FX_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT`) if callbacks aren't received within 30 seconds The mandatory sync requirement essentially ensures that your webhook implementations meet stringent regulatory standards for financial transaction processing while maintaining data sovereignty within Indian infrastructure."

Here's what's happening:## Root Cause AnalysisFor order **29912440** (merchant: icicipru, payment gateway: PAYU), the refund gateway sync shows a success status, but it remains marked as pending on your end due to a **case sensitivity issue** in the status response handling.## The IssueAccording to the Slack discussion found, the problem is that:1. **Normal successful cases**: PAYU typically returns the success status in **lowercase**2. **Your specific order**: PAYU returned the success status in **uppercase** 3. **System behavior**: Your refund processing system wasn't properly handling the uppercase success status, causing it to remain in \"pending\" state despite the gateway showing success## Similar Pattern IdentifiedThe search results also show a related pattern documented in the Slack messages where during refund initiation, if an error occurs from the payment gateway, the system marks the refund as \"Pending\" and continues syncing. However, due to error responses during initiation, the system doesn't receive the `epgTxnId` from the gateway, making it unable to update the corresponding entry in the refund table.## Technical ContextFrom the documentation found, this appears to be part of a broader issue with PAYU refund sync processes where:- Initial refund requests may encounter errors but still process successfully on PAYU's end- Case sensitivity in status responses isn't being handled uniformly- The sync process continues but fails to properly update internal records due to missing transaction mappings## Recommended ActionThis case sensitivity issue should be escalated to the engineering team to implement proper case-insensitive status checking in the PAYU refund sync process, ensuring that both uppercase and lowercase success statuses are properly recognized and processed."

Here are the key examples:## Examples of Payment Gateway Configurations### 1. **RuPay Token OTP Support Configuration**For enabling RuPay token OTP support for a specific gateway, the process involves updating a configuration parameter :**Example Case**: Adding Gocashfree to support RuPay token repeat OTP- **Configuration**: `RUPAY_TOKEN_REPEAT_OTP_SUPPORTED_GATEWAYS`- **Process**: Simply adding the gateway name (e.g., \"Gocashfree\") to this configuration was sufficient to enable routing of RuPay token repeat OTP transactions- **Sample Order**: PD2520205TXNN4AJ14DQALS042 for merchant `dreameleven`The team confirmed that adding the PG to the config was sufficient, without requiring additional code changes .### 2. **UPI QR Payment Gateway Configuration**Several examples show how UPI QR configurations were managed:**Example 1**: StarHealth + Camspay UPI QR Support - **Requirement**: Enable UPI QR payments via Camspay gateway for merchant `starhealth`- **Challenge**: UPI QR was not supported for Camspay initially- **Solution**: Required both gateway-level support and PGCC (Payment Gateway Configuration Center) dashboard configuration**Example 2**: TPSL Gateway Routing Issue - **Issue**: ICICIPru enabled TPSL gateway with UPI (upi_pay) but UPI QR transactions were getting routed incorrectly- **Root Cause**: The system was checking UPI enablement in MGA (Merchant Gateway Account) for older transaction formats- **Investigation**: Sample orders 31050227, 31050230, 31050274 for MGA ID 5254### 3. **GSM (Gateway State Management) Configuration for UPI QR Timeouts****Example**: ICICILombard UPI QR Timeout Issue - **Problem**: UPI QR codes were failing after ~4.5 minutes instead of the expected 10 minutes- **Configuration**: GSM threshold settings - Initial threshold: 15.0 minutes with `CHECK_THRESHOLD_AND_UPDATE` action - Expected behavior: 10 minutes QR validity- **Process**: The system was checking transaction status via gateway sync and marking transactions as `AUTHORIZATION_FAILED` prematurely despite GSM configuration### 4. **Payment Method Structure Configuration****Backward Compatibility Handling** :- **Legacy Format**: `payment_method: UPI` with `txn_type: UPI_QR`- **New Format**: `payment_method: UPI_QR` - **Configuration Logic**: The system checks UPI enablement in MGA and gateway support for the transaction type- **Dashboard Control**: UPI_QR enablement on dashboard affects filtering, but only for merchants passing `pm=UPI_QR`### 5. **CBDC Payment Method Configuration****Example**: New CBDC Payment Method - **Implementation**: CBDC configured exactly like UPI_QR- **Testing Setup**: Live credentials configured for test merchants (testhdfc2, testhdfc1) in UAT- **Challenge**: End-to-end testing was blocked by payment failures after 30 seconds of QR activity## Key Configuration Processes:1. **Gateway-Level Configuration**: Adding gateways to specific support lists (e.g., `RUPAY_TOKEN_REPEAT_OTP_SUPPORTED_GATEWAYS`)2. **PGCC Dashboard Configuration**: Enabling payment methods through the dashboard interface for merchant access3. **MGA (Merchant Gateway Account) Settings**: Controlling which payment methods are available per merchant-gateway combination4. **GSM (Gateway State Management)**: Configuring timeout thresholds and status update behaviors for different transaction states5. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining support for both legacy and new transaction request formatsThese examples show that gateway configurations typically involve multiple layers - from low-level gateway support lists to merchant-facing dashboard controls, with careful consideration for backward compatibility and proper timeout/sync behaviors."

    "question": "What were the root causes and resolutions for the recent incidents involving incorrect webhooks for auto-refunds and encrypted webhook credentials?",
    "answer": "There were two separate high-severity incidents recently:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Webhooks for Auto-Refunds:** The root cause was a code change deployed around April 30th. This change made the system send `order succeeded` webhooks for auto-refunded transactions if a merchant's `webhook_api_version` was set to null, which was a change from the previous behavior. The resolution was to raise a hotfix (PR 5886) to correct this logic.\n\n2.  **Encrypted Webhook Credentials:** This was a Sev1 issue where webhook authorization headers contained encrypted data instead of the correct username/password. The root cause was a deployment that enabled PII encryption for new columns in the `merchant_account` table (like `webHookUsername` and `webHookPassword`). The service writing the data encrypted it, but the reading services lacked the corresponding decryption logic. The resolution was to revert the changes and run a fix on the production database to correct the affected data.",

    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the Slack discussions, there were several significant incidents involving webhooks for auto-refunds and encrypted webhook credentials:## Auto-Refund Webhook Issues**Root Cause:** The system was not properly sending `AUTO_REFUND_FAILED` webhooks after retry attempts were exhausted . The process was designed to send webhooks only for `AUTO_REFUND_INITIATED` but failed to trigger events for `SENDING_AUTO_REFUND_FAILED_WEBHOOK` .**Resolution Status:** The team identified that webhooks should be sent after all retries are exhausted , with one case showing a webhook was sent after 5 tries . However, there were still gaps in the logging and event triggering mechanism that required further debugging .## ORDER_SUCCEEDED Webhooks for Auto-Refunded Cases**Root Cause:** A critical bug was introduced by a PR raised on April 28th that caused the system to send `ORDER_SUCCEEDED` webhooks for transactions that were actually `AUTO_REFUNDED` . This circumvented all framework checks and balances, including the hierarchy of status .**Impact:** This issue went undetected until Kotak Insurance reported it, affecting an undetermined number of transactions .## Encrypted Webhook Credential Issues**Root Cause:** Multiple encryption-related problems were identified:- Decryption failures due to gateways potentially using different working keys (Working Key 1 vs Working Key 2) when only one was configured - Webhook payload structure updates from gateways causing decoding failures - Integrity framework not handling failure webhooks correctly by passing encrypted payloads instead of decrypting them first **Resolutions:**- A fix for webhook payload structure issues was scheduled for Thursday testing - The integrity framework issue was being addressed by decrypting payloads before updating PGR records - Teams were working on parallel fixes to handle the source issue in the integrity framework ## Broader ImpactThese incidents were part of two major production issues that went undetected for months, causing losses to merchants and requiring potential compensation discussions . The issues highlighted the need for better framework-level checks and balances in the webhook orchestration system .",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the search results, I can identify two major incidents involving webhooks for auto-refunds and their root causes and resolutions:## Major Webhook Incidents Identified### 1. CRED Status Mismatch Issue**Root Cause:** - The system was incorrectly interfering with the status sent by CRED payment gateway- This violated Juspay's core principle of not deducing status but only forwarding what the PA/PG sends- The refund/transaction status field was being modified instead of being treated as \"sacrosanct\"**Impact:** - Affected 4,000 orders from January to May 26th- Caused financial losses to merchants, with some reaching out for compensation- Went undetected for months**Resolution/CoE Required:** - Need to establish framework-level checks and balances to prevent status manipulation- Implement safeguards to ensure status is only forwarded, never deduced or modified### 2. ORDER_SUCCEEDED Webhooks for Auto-Refunded Cases**Root Cause:** - Caused by a PR (pull request) raised on April 28th- Bug circumvented all existing checks and balances in the framework- System was sending ORDER_SUCCEEDED webhooks for transactions that had AUTO_REFUNDED status- This violated the hierarchy of status in the system**Impact:** - Went undetected until Kotak Insurance reported the issue- Impacted merchant reconciliation and flow processes- Impact assessment was still ongoing when reported**Resolution/CoE Required:** - Need to strengthen framework-level checks to prevent status hierarchy violations- Implement additional validation layers for webhook event triggering### 3. Auto-Refund Webhook Processing Issues**Root Cause:** - AUTO_REFUND_FAILED webhooks were not being sent properly after retry exhaustion- System was only sending AUTO_REFUND_INITIATED webhooks but missing FAILED webhooks- Internal retry mechanism (up to 11 times) was not properly triggering failure webhooks**Resolution:** - Webhooks for auto-refund failures are sent only after all retries are exhausted- Process clarified: order gets marked auto-refunded first, then refund is initiated in parallel- When refund attempts are exhausted, AUTO_REFUND_FAILED webhook is sent to merchant### 4. Encrypted Webhook Credential Issues**Root Cause:** - Issues with AES encrypted webhook payloads- Problems with webhook integrity verification: \"Could not verify integrity of webhook response\" - Merchants not configuring AES key and IV properly in gateway accounts - Complex scenarios involving different PG credentials and reference IDs **Resolution Framework:** - Established 5 webhook authentication scenarios: 1. No ref id configured (standard format) 2. Ref id with same PG credentials (no ref id needed) 3. Ref id with different PG credentials (ref id required) 4. Tenant-level webhooks (global configuration) 5. Gateway-specific webhook URLs (sent during transaction initiation)**Action Items for Resolution:** - Maintain configuration for PGs requiring encryption- Debug CCA webhook cases- Verify webhook URL formats and reference ID requirements- Ensure proper AES key and IV configuration guidance for merchants## Overall Framework Improvements NeededThe incidents highlighted the need for :- Stronger framework-level checks and balances- Better status hierarchy validation- Improved webhook event triggering validation- Enhanced monitoring for webhook processing failures- Clearer merchant integration guidelines for encrypted webhooksThese incidents emphasized the critical importance of maintaining Juspay's role as an orchestrator that forwards payment gateway responses without modification, and the need for robust safeguards to prevent such violations."

    "answer": "The EMI+Mandate flow issue was caused by the `card info API` responding with general mandate support (`mandate_support` as True) without having the context for the combined EMI+Mandate flow. This led to transactions getting stuck in the 'STARTED' state because no intersecting gateway could be found that actually supported the specific flow.\n\nSeparately, the issue with Gateway Status Mapping (GSM) for an ICICI_UPI refund was that a mapping existed which incorrectly updated the status to 'success' based on a response message ('Transaction Successful'), even though the gateway's actual status was 'PENDING'. This practice of using GSM to determine a final success status was identified as risky, and the specific mapping was disabled.",

    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the retrieved context, there are two distinct issues related to your query:## EMI+Mandate Flow Issue - STARTED State TransactionsThe root cause of transactions getting stuck in 'STARTED' state for EMI+Mandate flows was a lack of proper communication and visibility between backend and frontend systems . The key problems identified were:1. **Card Info API limitations**: The Card Info API was checking if card bins were eligible for mandates without considering whether the specific card brand was enabled under the payment gateway or the gateway reference ID 2. **List Card API issues**: The API was showing mandate/EMI support on the UI even when the underlying payment gateway didn't support the mandate + token repeat flow, causing transactions to get stuck 3. **Gateway compatibility**: Merchants enabled EMI + Mandates flow where only specific gateway card bins (like CCAVENUE_V2) were eligible, but the card info API lacked this context and responded with general mandate support 4. **Order metadata missing**: The major APIs like List Card and Card Info didn't have visibility on order details, causing them to respond generally rather than based on specific order requirements ## ICICI_UPI GSM Issue - Incorrect Refund StatusRegarding the ICICI_UPI refund status issue, the problem was related to Gateway Status Mapping (GSM) entries that were matching response codes and messages, leading to automatic status updates without proper verification . The specific case mentioned:- **Order ID**: 1715578772jp25378892812 for merchant 'railyatri' - **Issue**: There was a mismatch in refund status between ICICI_UPI and Juspay, where no success logs were found but the status was updated to success - **Root cause**: A GSM entry was present that matched the response code and message, causing automatic status updates based on this mapping rather than actual transaction verification Both issues highlight the need for more precise API responses based on actual gateway capabilities and more careful GSM configuration to prevent incorrect status updates.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on my search through the available incident reports and technical documentation, I can provide you with details about both incidents that required changes to core logic:## EMI+Mandate Flow Issue - Root Cause AnalysisThe **EMI+Mandate flow transactions stuck in 'STARTED' state** had multiple root causes :### Primary Root Causes:1. **API Visibility Issues**: The major APIs (List Card, Card Info) lacked visibility on order details/metadata, causing them to respond generically without context .2. **Gateway Support Mismatches**: - Card bins could be supported for mandates, but underlying Payment Gateways didn't support the mandate + token repeat flow - EMI was enabled for banks via PGs that didn't support EMI + Token repeat, causing transactions to get stuck - Merchants enabled EMI + Mandates flow where only specific gateways (like CCAVENUE_V2) supported the flow, but Card Info API had no context and responded with general mandate support 3. **Configuration Gaps**: - No functional gateways supporting specific transaction combinations - Card brand enablement issues under PGs - Missing eligibility checks for specific gateway + flow combinations ### Specific Technical Issues:- **AMEX and DINERS networks** had limited PG support for token repeat transactions - **EMI Plans API** shared gateway info but not card brands enabled under PGs, causing configuration issues - Merchants couldn't control which card bins were enabled for mandates, leading to misconfigurations ## ICICI_UPI GSM Issue - Root Cause AnalysisThe **ICICI_UPI GSM problem with incorrect refund statuses** involved Gateway Status Mapping (GSM) configuration issues:### Root Cause:The core problem was **missing or incorrect GSM entries** for specific gateway responses . Specifically:1. **Missing GSM Entry for 'Pending' Status**: Juspay's system couldn't map the 'pending' notification status from gateways due to missing Gateway Status Mapping entries, causing workflows to be stuck waiting on system-level state transitions .2. **DEEMED Status Handling**: For ICICI_UPI refunds, when the gateway returned \"DEEMED\" status, the GSM mapping incorrectly handled this status. The gateway required waiting at least T+1 days for deemed transactions, but Juspay's system was reinitiating refunds within 30 minutes, leading to \"Duplicate merchant TranId\" failures.3. **Status Mapping Discrepancies**: There were cases where: - Gateway confirmed refund was successful, but Juspay marked it as failed - GSM mappings were updating statuses based on incorrect assumptions - \"Transaction Timed out\" messages were being incorrectly mapped to failure states### Technical Impact:- The notification framework in Juspay's codebase (Euler) uses an explicit NotificationStatus state machine- GatewayStatusMap mapping logic determines how external gateway responses are converted to system states- When GSM entries were missing, code failed to find matching entries, causing indefinite workflow stalling ### Required Fixes:- Insert proper GSM entries for gateway-specific pending states- Correct mapping for DEEMED status handling with appropriate wait times- Review and validate GSM configurations for all gateway response typesBoth incidents required **core logic changes** to the payment processing system, specifically around API context handling for EMI+Mandate flows and GSM configuration management for proper status mapping."

AJIO (Multiple Issues)**- **Split Settlement Refund Issue**: Refunds failing with error \"Split info provided has amount mismatch with actual transaction amount\" despite valid settlement amounts, yet system still initiated refunds to PG - **Split Pending State**: Refunds failing with \"Invalid request; split is still in a pending state\" error for PAYU split settlement transactions - **Split Doesn't Exist**: Error \"Split doesn't exist for this transaction\" during refund initiation, despite successful split settlement transactions **3. Ixigo (MID: ixigoprod)**- **Issue**: Refund marked as failed with parsing error \"Parsing of the NonEmptyText value failed: Tried to convert an empty Text\" despite successful initiation to CRED gateway - **Impact**: Potential double refund situation due to status discrepancy **4.

The team suggested that merchants implement a \"fulfilment window based terminal status check instead of relying on the v2/pay/response redirection because there is a delay in many cases of 100/200 ms\" . However, the specific technical resolution details were not provided in the available context.The issue appears to be related to timing delays in status updates, where the order status API was not immediately reflecting the AUTO_REFUNDED status even after the webhook was sent, causing merchants to incorrectly fulfill orders that should have been refunded.",

This affects multiple scenarios:- 64.72% of cases involve gateway initialization errors in `gocashfree` & `PAYU` gateways - 22.88% involve `GW_VERIFY_OTP` step failures - 4.29% have errors in `v2/pay/response` calls ### 2. **Gateway-Specific Problems**- **MPGS Gateway**: 5% of transactions moving from failure to success due to delayed redirection responses, impacting ₹5.79Cr in processed amounts - **Cybersource**: Transactions moving from failure to success when merchants initiate order status checks during AuthN/AuthZ calls - **EPAYLATER**: Incorrect handling of pending statuses ('new' and 'agreed') causing failure-to-success cases - **LOANTAP**: 10% of transactions affected due to reduced sync frequency from 5 minutes to 90 seconds ### 3. **Auto-Refund Complications**For merchants with auto-refund enabled for failure-to-success cases, there are issues where refunds fail but the system blocks manual intervention . One critical case involved a ₹2.5 Lakh transaction where the refund was rejected by PAYU but the merchant couldn't initiate manual refunds .## Resolutions and Handling Approaches:### 1. **Framework-Level Changes**The team emphasized that \"Marking Transaction Status as Failure because of API call failure should never happen\" . They're working on a comprehensive Status framework implementation to handle these cases systematically .### 2. **Gateway-Specific Configurations**- **MPGS**: Added GSM entries to handle specific error patterns, though some limitations exist with dynamic variables - **LOANTAP**: Recommendation to add `PT_TXN_SYNC_FREQUENCY_MAPPINGS_LOANTAP` to start sync after 5 minutes instead of 90 seconds - **SBI**: Increased sync frequency to 30 seconds post-5 minutes and enabled \"authentication_failed_enabled_sync_gateways\" config ### 3. **Error Code and Status Management**The team has:- Restricted sync initiation for cases where second factor status is INIT - Introduced new error codes for unified handling - Implemented threshold-based failure marking to avoid false failure-to-success cases ### 4. **Manual Intervention Processes**For critical cases, the team performs:- Hard sync operations to update transaction status - Manual status updates from success to failure when requested by merchants - Force sync operations for impacted transactions ### 5. **Merchant Communication**The team is working with merchants to:- Update transaction statuses based on gateway confirmations - Handle refund scenarios for deemed successful transactions - Provide clear error messaging for split settlement mismatches The overall approach focuses on preventing these discrepancies through better sync logic, gateway-specific configurations, and comprehensive status framework implementation rather than just reactive fixes.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the search results, I can identify several recent issues regarding transaction status discrepancies and their resolutions. Let me provide you with a comprehensive overview:## Recent Transaction Status Discrepancy Issues### 1. **Primary Issue: Failure-to-Pending Status Discrepancy** **Problem**: After Juspay sends a failure webhook (`ORDER_FAILED`/`TXN_FAILED`) for an order/transaction, the system returns a \"pending\" status when merchants make order status sync calls.**Key Scenarios Contributing to This Issue**:- **1st Case (64.72% Contribution)**: Error in gateway init (`GW_INIT_TXN`) with 5xx responses in gocashfree & PAYU gateways- **2nd Case (22.88% Contribution)**: `GW_VERIFY_OTP` step failed with 2xx responses containing error messages- **3rd Case (4.29% Contribution)**: `v2/pay/response` had errors with 302 response codes- **4th Case (1.15% Contribution)**: `GW_AUTHORIZATION_SYNC` step failed due to gateway rate-limiting (429 responses)### 2. **SBI-CCIL Multiple Issues** **Problems Identified**:1. Unwanted Failure to Success cases - \"Invalid Reference Number\" error message was being handled as Failed instead of Pending2. Order and transaction status mismatch due to transaction status being overwritten from Failed to Pending3. Transactions being marked as Pending instead of receiving Success again**Resolution Actions Taken**:1. Added support in code for GSM handling to keep transactions with \"Invalid Reference Number\" error as Pending for a threshold, then moving to Authz Failed to handle F2S cases2. Increased PT sync frequency to 10 minutes for this gateway and merchant combination3. Enabled mandatory sync to consume status response during `v2/pay/response`### 3. **Branch-Pay10 Refund Processing Issue** **Problem**: Refunds for transactions (deemed successful) were processed by the gateway directly, but when merchants attempted to initiate refunds through the refund API, they received 'INVALID REFUND DATA' errors.**Resolution**: The gateway confirmed they would return a 'failure' status for such cases via API and manually update specific transactions from 'success' to 'failure' as requested by merchants.### 4. **Cybersource Failure-to-Success Issue** **Problem**: Transactions moving from FAILURE to SUCCESS when merchants are enabled for sync with PG during Juspay order status checks.**Root Cause**: When receiving `rcode` as 0, the application was marking transactions as failed, but merchant-initiated status checks were calling status checks with PG before AuthN and AuthZ calls were completed.**Proposed Resolution**: Block transaction sync with PG until AuthN and AuthZ calls are completed or for a specific time period from transaction initiation.## Common Resolution Patterns### Immediate Fixes:1. **Increased sync frequencies** for affected gateway-merchant combinations2. **Enabled mandatory sync** to properly consume webhook responses3. **Added GSM (Gateway Status Mapping) handling** for specific error messages4. **Manual status updates** for affected transactions### Systematic Improvements Needed:1. **Fix v2/pay/response handling** - The decrypted result in the preVerification step should be passed to the next function 2. **Improve sync reliability** - Not completely reliable, leading to rise in pending transactions 3. **Better webhook handling** - PGs not sending webhooks when failure transactions turn to success 4. **Enhanced status mapping** - Better prioritization of customer-related fields while initiating API calls with PG The team has identified that these issues require both immediate tactical fixes (like increasing sync frequencies and enabling mandatory sync) and longer-term strategic improvements to the core status handling and webhook processing systems."

The Global Info Sec team has required this upgrade by May 31st, 2025, as SHA-1 has known vulnerabilities that could expose systems to potential threats .**Data Localization Compliance**: The team is addressing data localization requirements that apply to anyone processing payments in India, including TPAPs, Plugins, Payment Aggregators, and Payment Gateways .## System Stability and Configuration Management**MGA Configuration Improvements**: A significant initiative involves removing legacy fallback mechanisms for `supported_payment_flows` configuration . The system now strictly adheres to defined behavior instead of relying on outdated fallbacks, with the change being rolled out incrementally to specific MGA IDs .**Unified System Architecture**: There's a comprehensive \"Switchboard\" system being developed to manage feature enablement/disabling across all systems . This includes:- Segregation of backend and frontend configs/API calls- Staggered A/B testing for config changes- Atomic rollback capabilities to ensure system integrity ## Operational Risk Management**Load Management for Merchant APIs**: The team is addressing high-volume API calls that impact system load, particularly around SIMPL's Eligibility API calls triggered by merchant \"Refresh Wallet Balances\" requests . This affects multiple merchants including Zepto, Myntra, and 1Paisa .**Merchant Configuration Self-Service**: There's a push to enable merchants to own their configurations themselves rather than having operations teams handle these activities . This includes showing upfront messages about CUG (Closed User Group) processes that need completion .## Observability and Monitoring**Business Reliability Engineering (BRE)**: A comprehensive \"Towards Zero Escalations\" initiative is being developed . This includes:- Enhanced error categorization (Internal vs. External, System vs. Business)- Improved anomaly detection with auto-RCA capabilities- A/B system investments for post-release monitoring- Target of less than 2 escalations per month **Unified Observability Platform**: Plans for a unified approach to analytics and monitoring are being discussed, moving away from separate systems built by different teams . This aims to eliminate bottlenecks in migration and changes .",

What was the reasoning behind removing the ability for merchants to update their API version from the dashboard, and what is the correct procedure now if a merchant needs to be on a newer version?",
    "answer": "The ability for merchants to update their webhook API version was removed from the dashboard as part of a strategic decision to simplify integration. For new merchants, the system defaults to the latest version at the time of their onboarding, and the version parameter has been removed from public documentation.\n\nIf an existing merchant, like `caratlane`, needs to upgrade their API version to access new features, the update must be handled internally. The current procedure is to make an on-demand request for an engineer to update the merchant's default `api_version` in their account settings via an internal API. There are plans to add this functionality to an admin dashboard for easier internal management.",

    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the Slack discussions about the `caratlane` incident, here's what happened regarding API version management:## The Caratlane IssueThe merchant `caratlane` was experiencing inconsistent behavior where the `remaining_refundable_amount` field was present for some API versions (2024-07-22, 2025-04-16) but missing for others (2025-01-01) . The issue was traced to their merchant account having an old `api_version` of `2024-06-28`, which caused internal order status calls to use this version and cache responses without the field for 30 minutes .## Reasoning Behind Removing Dashboard Version UpdatesThe ability for merchants to update webhook API versions via dashboard was removed because **version headers have created issues multiple times** . The team identified several problems:1. **Lack of Streamlined Process**: There was no proper process to inform merchants about version changes, especially data type or format changes . When merchants used older versions, they missed relevant fields/params, impacting their business use-cases and reconciliation processes .2. **Merchant Confusion**: Merchants weren't aware of what the correct version should be, leading to issues like passing the current date as version, which broke their flows .3. **Multiple Historical Issues**: The team decided to remove version headers for new merchants entirely, as they had caused problems repeatedly .## Current Procedure for Version UpdatesFor merchants needing newer API versions:1. **Backend Database Update**: The merchant account update API supports version updates from the backend side , though ideally database fixes should be avoided .2. **New Merchant Strategy**: - New merchants are automatically set to the latest version during onboarding in `merchant_account.default_version` - New merchants should be on the latest API payload always, without needing to pass version headers - The system uses the `default_version` value if no version is passed in headers 3. **Version Management Process**: - New versions and change logs should be published - Merchants need to make relevant changes at their end with required version bump-ups - For existing merchants, the dashboard remains as-is, while new documentation should not mention version requirements For the caratlane case specifically, the immediate fix was asking the merchant to use an older version temporarily, while raising the issue with the Euler team to understand format changes in latest versions .",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the context I've gathered from the search results, I can now provide a comprehensive answer about the CaratLane incident and the API version management changes.## CaratLane Incident Summary and API Version Management Changes### The CaratLane IncidentThe CaratLane incident involved the `remaining_refundable_amount` field being inconsistently present in order status API responses . The issue occurred because:1. **Version-specific field availability**: The field was present in API versions 2024-07-22 and 2025-04-16, but missing in version 2025-01-01 2. **Caching complications**: CaratLane's merchant account had API version set to `2024-06-28`, which caused internal order status calls to be cached for 30 minutes without the `remaining_refundable_amount` field 3. **Merchant dependency**: CaratLane relied on this field for their refund processing logic, making this a blocking issue ### Reasoning Behind Removing Dashboard API Version UpdatesThe ability for merchants to update their API versions from the dashboard was removed as part of a broader strategy change:1. **Version key deprecation**: The dashboard support was removed when the version key was deprecated [referenced in search results]2. **Strategic shift to controlled versioning**: The team moved to a more controlled approach where: - For new merchants: Latest version is automatically set during onboarding in `merchant_account.default_version` - Version remains static unless merchant requires new features or payload changes - Version bumps are done on-demand from the backend after merchant confirms backward compatibility [referenced in search results]3. **Toggle-based approach**: The strategy shifted toward toggle-based webhooks rather than version-based management, especially for new merchants [referenced in search results]### Current Procedure for API Version UpdatesWhen a merchant needs to be on a newer API version, the current procedure is:1. **Backend-only updates**: Merchants can no longer update API versions themselves - it must be done from the backend [referenced in search results]2. **Manual coordination**: Updates require coordination with the backend team (e.g., Ankit Jain was asked to update CaratLane's API version in production) 3. **Merchant confirmation required**: Before version updates, merchants must confirm that their systems are backward compatible and that the flow works as expected 4. **Both environments**: Updates typically need to be applied to both sandbox and production environments ### Resolution of CaratLane IssueThe CaratLane issue was resolved by having the backend team update their API version in both sandbox and production environments, after the merchant confirmed the flow was working as expected .This incident highlights the importance of having proper version management processes and clear communication channels when merchants need API version updates, especially since they can no longer self-service these changes through the dashboard."

    "answer": "Yes, we have two recent examples of such inconsistencies. First, for the merchant Curefit, orders were stuck in a `PENDING` state even when the gateway response confirmed one part of a split payment was `CHARGED`. The system failed to update the overall order status to `PARTIAL_CHARGED`. Second, for the merchant railyatri, our dashboard was displaying a refund ARN, but the gateway's response showed the `arn_number` as null, indicating our system was incorrectly mapping the RRN to the ARN field.",

    ],
    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the retrieved context, here are several examples of data inconsistencies between your system and payment gateways:## Order Status Update Inconsistencies**1. Order Status Mapping Issues**There are transactions where `actual_order_status` is marked as 'NEW', but the corresponding `actual_payment_status` values are inconsistent—appearing as 'STARTED', 'JUSPAY_DECLINED', and 'PENDING_VBV', which seems incorrect . This suggests improper mapping between order and payment statuses.**2. Failure-to-Success Status Changes**For merchant 'branch' using 'pay10' gateway, transactions that were initially marked as failures were later processed as successful by the gateway directly after reconciliation with the bank . The merchant attempted to initiate refunds through the API for these transactions, which resulted in 'INVALID REFUND DATA' errors from the gateway . The gateway confirmed these transactions had already been successfully refunded from their end .**3. Decode Failures Leading to Status Inconsistencies**For EazyDiner transactions, decode failures occurred because the system expected a mandatory 'vpa' field in the payer block, but the gateway response didn't include it . This caused transactions to not be marked as charged despite successful processing at the gateway level .**4. Missing Mandatory Fields**For Wakefit orders using PINELABS_ONLINE, the system expected a mandatory 'details' field in the tenure response which was missing, causing decode failures and preventing transaction status updates . The transaction was successful at the gateway but couldn't be updated in your system .## Refund Data Processing Inconsistencies**1. Auto-Refund Gateway Sync Issues**For MID 'zeptomarketplace', an auto-refund was initiated on May 05, 2025, but it was not initiated to the gateway . The field `sent_to_gateway` was marked as false, creating a discrepancy between internal refund status and actual gateway processing .**2. Split Settlement Refund Amount Mismatches**For TimesPrime merchant, refunds for split payment orders were being initiated based on the total transaction amount instead of the exact amount processed for each individual transaction . For example, order 'KSAQ5524TURI7285MQRQ' had a ₹886 transaction with a ₹1 offer applied (captured amount ₹885), but the system attempted to refund ₹886 instead of ₹885, causing gateway failures .**3. Missing epgTxnId During Refund Processing**For PayU refunds, when errors occurred during refund initiation, the system didn't receive the `epgTxnId` from the gateway . During subsequent sync processes, responses containing the `epgTxnId` couldn't be matched to existing refund entries, leaving refunds in 'Pending' state while being successful at the gateway .**4. Refund Status Sync Failures**For AJIO merchant, despite detecting amount mismatches in split settlement refunds and showing the error message 'Split info provided has amount mismatch with actual transaction amount', the system continued to initiate refunds to the payment gateway instead of failing the process . This create sync attempts returned 'Record not found' errors, yet `sent_to_gateway` was marked as true, creating data inconsistency .These examples demonstrate systematic issues with data synchronization, field validation, error handling, and status mapping between your internal systems and various payment gateways.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on my search of your system's logs and incident reports, I can provide you with several examples of data inconsistencies between your system and payment gateways.

This was identified as expected behavior based on transaction amount (e.g., amounts > 700 take time, < 500 succeed). Since merchants needed to test higher success amounts, the suggested workaround was to use the VPA `success@upi` to force a successful transaction.\n\n2.  **Payment Method Typo:** A payment method was created with a typo (`NB_CFSB` instead of `NB_CSFB`), causing frontend issues for a merchant. To fix this, the incorrect entry needs to be deleted. However, the deletion API is not exposed, so the proposed solutions were to either raise an Alfred ticket or use the unexposed API via Postman.",

    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the context I have from the search results, I can see two main configuration issues mentioned. Let me provide you with the details about these problems and their solutions:## DUMMY Payment Gateway Transaction Status Issue**Problem**: The issue occurred when using the DUMMY gateway for testing. When 2 transactions were charged by the gateway, the system would:- Move the first transaction to CHARGED status- Keep the second transaction in PENDING_VBV status - During sync with the gateway, the second transaction should move to AUTO_REFUNDED based on CHARGED status received from gateway- However, the auto-refund mechanism wasn't working properly in some cases**Additional Configuration Issue**: Even when `autoRefundMultipleChargedTransactions` was set to false in the merchant account, the system relied on merchant_config value and would fallback to merchant_account value if not present. Since `autoRefundMultipleChargedTransactions` was true in the config, it should have worked but didn't.**Solution**: The solution involved ensuring proper configuration hierarchy where:- System checks merchant_config value first- Falls back to merchant_account value if not present- For the working case cited: Order ID `JUSP1757517572` for MID `mandate_juspay` showed the correct auto-refund behavior## Gateway Status Mapping (GSM) Configuration Issue**Problem**: Two specific mandate execution failures were identified:1. **Order SPSE2510042220364712**: The core problem was Juspay's system being unable to map the 'pending' notification status from HYPER_PG gateway due to a missing Gateway Status Mapping (GSM) entry. This configuration gap caused the workflow to be stuck waiting on a system-level state transition.2. **Order SPSE2510042220377516**: Pre-debit notification (PDN) delivery failure - the system couldn't send or complete the required customer notification, resulting in 'PDN Failed. Your notification is in pending state' error.**Proposed Solutions**: For GSM Mapping Issue:- **Fix**: Insert GSM entry for HYPER_PG 'pending' state mapped to JuspayStatus 'Pending' for mandate flows- The Haskell code at the notification/status mapping layer confirms only known values can progress the workflowFor PDN Notification Issue:- Improve resilience by implementing notification delivery retries- Add proper alerts for notification failures - Implement better merchant-side monitoring of notification completion- Per RBI guidelines, if notification delivery doesn't mark 'success' or remains 'pending', debit is blocked entirely**Impact Summary**: - 3,899 cases of 'PDN Failed. Your notification is in pending state' were observed for flipkartpayin3 in two days with 0% success rate- The GSM mapping problem was less frequent but significant for troubleshootingBoth issues required manual intervention to resolve and highlighted the need for better configuration management and monitoring systems."

    "answer": "The issues had two different root causes:\n1.  **Snapdeal:** Card transactions were failing due to an 'Offer not applicable' error. The root cause was a code change that made the previously acceptable `\"offer_data\": {\"offer_details\": null}` format invalid. The fix was to remove the `offer_details` block and pass `\"offer_data\": null`.\n2.  **Airtel:** The `logs.juspay.in/payment/status` endpoint was returning 503 errors because the entire service had been deprecated and removed under the mistaken belief it was unused. This API is used for invoice calculations, and its removal resulted in the loss of billing data from January 8th onwards, with data for Jan and Feb 2025 confirmed as lost.",

The team was actively on a call with the merchant when this issue was reported.However, the specific root cause analysis for this token expiration issue is not detailed in the available context.### Additional Snapdeal-Related InformationThe context also shows that Snapdeal had concerns about transaction routing when they went live with the GOCASHFREE gateway . Specifically:- They routed only 10% of cards traffic via Gocashfree gateway- However, over 50% of cards where the issuer country was not India were being routed via Cashfree- They questioned whether card issuer country affects transaction routing even without explicit logic in the Payment Logic (PL)## Airtel Payment Status Logging and Billing ImpactUnfortunately, **the available context does not contain specific information about Airtel's payment status logging issues or their billing impact**. The search results show various merchant issues with payment status mismatches and logging problems, but none specifically mention Airtel or provide details about billing impact for Airtel.## Other Related Merchant Issues FoundThe context does reveal several other significant merchant issues with similar patterns:1. **Firstcry Status Mismatch**: Payment marked successful at gateway but showing as `AUTHN_FAILED` in Juspay systems2. **PayU Integration Issues**: 253 failures across merchants due to amount mismatches between Juspay and PayU calculations 3. **ICICI Lombard UPI Issues**: QR code transactions failing after 4.5 minutes due to status check issuesTo get complete information about Airtel's specific payment status logging and billing impact issues, I would need to search for more specific terms or access additional data sources that contain Airtel-related incident reports."

Despite the split settlement settings being correctly configured, there was a mismatch between the submid and the available gateway mappings.### 3. Request to Change Error Message for Disabled Refunds**Issue**: There was a request from the PI team to change the error message format when refunds are not enabled for a merchant ID. **Current Error Message**:```json \"status\": \"error\", \"error_code\": \"access_denied\", \"error_info\": { \"user_message\": \"Unauthorized.\", \"developer_message\": \"Merchant disabled for refund\", \"code\": \"UNAUTHORIZED\", \"category\": \"USER_ERROR\" }}```**Reason for Change Request**: The PI team was trying to create alerts based on this API response, but the current complex error structure was causing handling issues. They requested a simpler, single-line error message format to facilitate better alert processing.### 4. Database-Related Internal Server Errors**Additional Context**: There were also broader internal server errors affecting `/txns` API calls, with underlying database issues including:- SQL syntax errors - Collation mismatch errors (\"Illegal mix of collations\")- MySQL version compatibility issuesThese database-level issues were contributing to the overall pattern of internal server errors across multiple API endpoints.The team was actively investigating these issues, with specific mentions of team members like @Richa, @Yashasvi Dwivedi, and others being tagged for resolution."

The backend encountered a failure because the offer detail object lacked the required 'TxnOfferDetailStatus' field, triggering a code path that returns a generic 500 error instead of a specific business error .2. **Second attempt**: Payment processed successfully but hit a business rule error 'COUNTER with dimensions [OfferId, MerchantId, CustomerId] has reached Max' (JP701), meaning the offer limit was exhausted .**Technical Issue**: The codebase analysis showed that if the mandatory 'TxnOfferDetailStatus' is missing, the transformation layer raises a generic 500 error when internal states are not handled properly .**Current Impact**: Multiple transactions are being declined with \"Something went wrong\" errors, specifically impacting 'Offer Txns' with 207 such orders reported in a single day .## Bulk API 500 Errors**Current Status**: The Bulk API is experiencing 500 Internal Server Error issues . The error logs show:```HTTP.Exceptions.StatusError(500, \"POST\", \"/download?schedule=true\", HTTP.Messages.Response:\"Something went wrong\")```**Debugging Approach**: The team is investigating whether the error originates from the Bulk Download API itself, as they are unable to locate corresponding logs in Istio/Envoy .

    "question": "What were the root causes for the recent payment processing issues affecting merchants like Zepto in production and ABSLI in the UAT environment?",
    "answer": "There were two separate issues. For merchants like Zepto, production transaction latency was not caused by a PT sync failure as initially suspected. The root cause was that the default sync frequency (starting at 300 seconds) is too slow for their 3-minute fulfillment window, and a custom frequency needs to be configured. For the issue affecting ABSLI in UAT, users were not being redirected to the payment simulator page. This was caused by a recent SDK change that triggered multiple `pay/start` calls, which has since been reverted.",

In one case, the system attempted to refund ₹886 instead of ₹885 for a Razorpay transaction (order KSAQ5524TURI7285MQRQ), causing gateway failures with the error \"The refund amount provided is greater than the amount captured.\"**Redis Decoding Error :** Zepto faced a screen issue after OTP submission for Kotak credit card payments (order 8132DRNEQ39047), caused by a Redis exception with error \"rGet value cannot be decoded to target type\" - specifically a type mismatch where a String was expected but a Number was received for key `token_bin_449266791`.**Amazonpay Later De-linking Issue :** When offers configured for Amazonpaylater were applied, the wallet was getting de-linked even after multiple linking attempts, though normal flow worked fine without offers.## ABSLI (Aditya Birla Sun Life) Issues:**Amount Check Failures :** ABSLI experienced failures marked as 'AMOUNT_CHECK_FAILED' caused by mismatches in surcharge and total transaction amount calculation between Juspay and PayU. The root cause was identified as discrepancies in SHA512 hash validation that includes transaction amounts, which must exactly match Juspay's computed amount (base + surcharge + tax). This issue particularly affected EMI/no-cost EMI flows and was systemic across multiple merchants using PayU integration.## Cross-Merchant Impact:The PayU amount validation issue was not isolated to ABSLI but affected multiple merchants including TataAIA, ICICI Pru, GoIndigo, and Star Health, with 253 total failures across merchants in 30 days, all showing 0% success rate for AMOUNT_CHECK_FAILED transactions.",

'Mismatch between payment instrument and payment locking filter' Error - Acciojobs**Root Cause:** Based on the available context, this error appears to be related to a **payment instrument validation issue** where there's a configuration mismatch between the payment method being used and the payment locking filter settings configured for the merchant.**Limited Context Available:**- Order ID: LSPd6EcekrMwaHV- Error: \"Mismatch between payment instrument and payment locking filter\"- Status: JUSPAY DECLINEDUnfortunately, the search results don't provide detailed root cause analysis for the Acciojobs payment locking filter issue. The available context shows the error was reported but doesn't include the technical investigation details or resolution steps that were taken.## Recommendations:For the Myntra RUPAY/AMEX BIN issue, the resolution would likely involve:1. Correcting the BIN mapping configuration to properly identify RUPAY cards2. Ensuring proper card type validation before sending to Cybersource3. Implementing additional validation checks to prevent BIN misidentificationFor the Acciojobs payment locking filter issue, more detailed investigation would be needed to understand the specific configuration mismatch and provide targeted recommendations."

The main issues include:- Invalid token reference IDs (191 Amex cases)- Token state mismatches where \"The token state does not allow the operation\" (361 Visa cases)- Ineligible tokens marked as \"CARD_NOT_ELIGIBLE\" (84 Visa cases)- Rupay API errors (25 cases)- Connection timeouts (45 cases)These errors occur due to mismatches in token status between Juspay's system and the card networks .**Specific Token Issues**: Merchants like BMS are experiencing issues where saved card entries exist but corresponding tokens don't exist in the token table, leading to \"No such token exists\" errors . Similarly, Diners cards weren't showing up in ListCard because they were already tokenized but had no available gateway to process transactions .## Payment Gateway Data Mismatches**Split Settlement Issues**: AJIO is experiencing split settlement refund problems where the system reports \"Split info provided has amount mismatch with actual transaction amount\" but still processes the refund as pending instead of failing it outright . For example, with an original amount of 3292.59 and settlement amount of 399, the system should fail but continues processing.**Dashboard Data Discrepancies**: Tata AIA faced significant data mismatch issues where downloaded dashboard data showed 92,731 unique order IDs while the summary table showed only 91,247 unique order IDs for the same filters . The merchant reported ongoing inconsistencies in downloaded data.**Transaction Status Mismatches**: FirstCry reported cases where payments were successful at the gateway with amounts debited, but marked as `AUTHN_FAILED` on Juspay's end with the error \"Since Wallet Account exists, a Direct Wallet Token is mandatory for this transaction\" .## Solutions Being Implemented**For Token Issues**: The team is implementing:1. Token status check API calls for all tokens2. Async token status check API calls (tokenStatus) to update entries whenever tokenization/get fails 3. Improved error messages to provide clearer explanations **For Card Data Issues**: There were inconsistencies where 9-digit BINs were mapped to correct Rupay Domestic card details, but 6-digit BINs were incorrectly mapped to Diners (US issued card), causing international card classification errors and preventing alt_id provisioning calls .**General Recommendations**: Recent AutoRCA analysis suggests implementing better error parsing, distributed locking for counter operations, and enhanced monitoring to distinguish between business declines and technical errors .",

    "question": "What are some recent examples of how our system's handling of transaction statuses has negatively impacted merchants, particularly regarding failed, pending, or uninitiated states?",
    "answer": "We have faced two significant issues recently related to transaction status handling. First, for the Pinelabs gateway, transactions that were actually 'Pending' were being incorrectly marked as 'Failed' in our system. This led to 'Failure to Success' cases, causing major reconciliation problems and an escalation from the merchant Tripjack. The root cause was an incorrect status mapping for a response code combination not present in their documentation. Second, some orders are getting stuck in the 'NEW' state when the initial transaction API call fails due to a network error. This is misleading for merchants as the failure is not visible on their dashboard, preventing them from taking action like re-initiating the transaction. The proposed solution is to mark these orders as 'JUSPAY_DECLINED' to provide better visibility.",

    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on recent Slack discussions, there are several concerning examples of how transaction status handling has negatively impacted merchants:## Major Status Mismatch Issues**Failure-to-Success Cases**: Multiple merchants experienced transactions marked as failed on Juspay's end while payment gateways showed success with customer debits. For example, Firstcry reported transactions marked as `AUTHN_FAILED` with \"Since Wallet Account exists, a Direct Wallet Token is mandatory\" error, despite successful gateway processing and customer debits . Similarly, BigBasket faced issues with EPAYLATER transactions where Juspay sent 'order failed' webhooks but later received success responses from the gateway .**Pending-to-Failed Inconsistencies**: A systematic analysis found that after Juspay sends failure webhooks (`ORDER_FAILED`/`TXN_FAILED`), the system incorrectly returns *pending* status during merchant order status sync calls . This affects 64.72% of cases due to gateway init errors, 22.88% from OTP verification failures, and smaller percentages from other gateway response issues .## Merchant-Specific Impact Examples**Swiggy**: Experienced status discrepancies where transactions showed failure webhooks from the gateway on July 13th, but merchant order status checks returned `Pending_VBV` until July 15th, causing significant confusion .**Kotak Insurance**: Requested additional parameters in order status API responses to indicate conflicted transactions that will be auto-refunded, as they keep transactions open until receiving `Pending_VBV` status, blocking customers from initiating new transactions .**Vodafone App**: Faced a massive spike in stuck transactions - from 28 in May to 98,241 by mid-July - where transactions remained in 'Authorizing' status instead of moving to terminal states after 7 days as expected .**ICICI Lombard**: UPI QR transactions failed prematurely at ~4.5 minutes instead of the expected 10-minute window, with the system incorrectly marking transactions as `AUTHORIZATION_FAILED` despite GSM configuration allowing 10 minutes .## Gateway-Specific Problems**YPP Gateway (Branch Merchant)**: Transactions only reach terminal states after receiving gateway webhooks, with no automatic PT sync triggering for pending transactions, leaving them stuck in `PENDING_AUTHENTICATION` indefinitely .**Pinelabs**: Transactions getting stuck in pending state due to missing webhooks, requiring manual sync to move to failed state with \"TRANSACTION FAILED DUE TO LATE AUTH\" error .**Pay Impact**Customer Blocking**: Multiple merchants reported that incorrect pending statuses prevent customers from initiating new transactions, directly impacting business operations .**Reconciliation Issues**: Status mismatches create significant challenges for merchant reconciliation processes, particularly when webhooks and status checks provide conflicting information .**Manual Intervention Required**: Many cases require manual PT sync or internal team intervention to resolve, indicating systemic issues with automated status management .These examples demonstrate that transaction status handling issues are widespread across different payment gateways and merchant types, with impacts ranging from customer experience degradation to operational complications for merchant partners.",

The root cause was a database collation error: \"Illegal mix of collations (latin1_swedish_ci,IMPLICIT) and (utf8mb3_general_ci,COERCIBLE) for operation\" .2. **Payment Methods Configuration**: Another HDFC issue was resolved by making changes in the payment methods config and re-enabling from PGCC .3. **Transaction Not Found Cases**: HDFC PG had ~500 pending cases where \"Transaction Not Found\" responses weren't being properly mapped to failure after a 15-minute threshold. The system was hardcoded to handle specific gwCode and gwMsg combinations, but HDFC wasn't defined in the service config, causing transactions to remain forever in pending status .## Zoomcar IssuesWhile Zoomcar isn't specifically mentioned in the recent context, there are similar patterns of internal system issues affecting merchants.## Zepto IssuesZepto experienced a **wallet refresh balance issue** with SIMPL gateway . The root cause was **internal**: SIMPL gateway was missing a refreshBalance implementation that calls external APIs. The system was returning 5-month-old cached balance data instead of making fresh API calls to SIMPL, while eligibility calls worked correctly because they had proper external API integration.## Pattern Analysis: Internal vs External CausesMost of these issues appear to be **internal system problems** rather than external gateway failures:- **HDFC**: Database configuration issues, payment method configs, and hardcoded logic problems - **Zepto/SIMPL**: Missing API implementation in internal codebase - **Other merchants**: Similar patterns of internal configuration and code issues affecting PayU integration with amount validation failures The common theme is that these are primarily **internal Juspay system issues** - configuration problems, missing implementations, database collation errors, and hardcoded logic gaps - rather than external gateway or bank-side failures.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on my search through the available context, I can provide you with an overview of recent merchant-impacting issues:## HDFC 500 Errors - Root Cause AnalysisFrom the context fragments, there are **two distinct types of HDFC-related 500 errors** with different root causes:### 1. Database Collation Issues - **Root Cause**: Database collation mismatch causing SQL errors- **Error Message**: \"Illegal mix of collations (latin1_swedish_ci,IMPLICIT) and (utf8mb3_general_ci,COERCIBLE) for operation\"- **Impact**: ~34 transactions affected across multiple merchants, with major impact on Mastercard card brand- **Nature**: **Internal system issue** - database configuration problem### 2. HDFC PG Transaction Not Found Issues - **Root Cause**: System configuration gap in Gateway Status Mapping (GSM)- **Problem**: When HDFC gateway returns \"Transaction not found\" errors, transactions remain stuck in pending status forever due to missing threshold configuration- **Impact**: ~500 transactions reported by Starhealth alone- **Nature**: **Internal configuration issue** - hardcoded handling without proper threshold mapping## Internal vs External Cause Patterns### Internal Causes (System/Configuration Issues):1. **Offer Engine Failures** : Missing 'TxnOfferDetailStatus' field causing 500 errors during offer application2. **Database Issues** : SQL collation mismatches 3. **Configuration Gaps** : Missing GSM entries and threshold configurations4. **Cache Synchronization Issues** : Redis cache not updated when DB is updated directly for HDFC merchants### External Causes (Gateway/Business Issues):1. **Gateway Downtime** : Axis Biz gateway outages causing 60% failure rates2. **Business Rule Violations** : PayU amount verification failures due to surcharge mismatches3. **Customer-side Issues**: Insufficient funds, incorrect UPI PINs## Zoomcar and Zepto IssuesFrom the available context, I found limited specific information about Zoomcar and Zepto issues, but I did identify:### Zepto Issue:- **Problem**: Auto-refund initiated but not sent to gateway (`sent_to_gateway: false`) [search results]- **Order ID**: 30E6ADPVN69528- **Nature**: **Internal system issue** - refund processing failureThe pattern shows that **most recent merchant-impacting issues are internally caused** rather than external gateway problems:## Key Recommendations:1. **Fix Database Collation Issues**: Address SQL collation mismatches affecting multiple merchants2. **Update GSM Configurations**: Proper threshold mapping for HDFC \"Transaction not found\" scenarios3. **Improve Error Handling**: Better distinction between internal errors and business rule failures4. **Cache Synchronization**: Fix Redis cache invalidation when DB is updated directly5. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Better visibility into root causes of merchant failuresThe trend indicates that while external gateway issues do occur (like Axis Biz downtime), the majority of merchant-impacting 500 errors are stemming from internal system configuration and coding issues that need immediate attention."

These included: failures during the initial transaction step (`GW_INIT_TXN`) with 5xx errors on gateways like `gocashfree` and `PAYU`; failures during OTP verification (`GW_VERIFY_OTP`); and failures during synchronous authorization (`GW_AUTHORIZATION_SYNC`) due to `429` rate-limiting errors.

A similar latency issue was also seen with mpokket via Paytm_v2.\n\nThe new behavior, which is now live, is to keep the transaction in a 'Pending' state when a synchronous status check fails due to timeouts or 5xx errors.

Here are the key scenarios and issues identified:## Different Scenarios Where the Problem Occurred:### 1. **High Latency 5XX Responses During Status Sync** - **Issue**: Transactions marked as failure at Juspay's end despite being successful at the gateway- **Example**: Gameskraft case where transaction was successful at Gocashfree but marked as failure due to 5XX response with high latency during status sync- **Problem**: Instead of marking transactions as \"authentication failed,\" a gateway sync call should have been initiated to retrieve the latest transaction status### 2. **Failure Webhook Followed by Pending Status** The analysis identified multiple contributing scenarios:**Case 1 (64.72% contribution)**: Gateway initialization errors- 5XX responses from `gocashfree` & `PAYU` gateways- 2XX responses from `PAYTMV2` but with error content**Case 2 (22.88% contribution)**: `GW_VERIFY_OTP` step failures- 2XX responses but containing error messages**Case 3 (4.29% contribution)**: `GW_POST_PAY_RESPONSE` errors- 302 response codes with error content**Case 4 (1.15% contribution)**: `GW_AUTHORIZATION_SYNC` failures- 429 responses (rate-limiting from GOCASHFREE)### 3. **Async Status Checks on Non-Initiated Transactions** - **Issue**: Status checks performed with gateways even when transactions weren't initiated- **Result**: \"Order not found\" or \"transaction not found\" errors from gateways- **Impact**: Discrepancies in success rates and transaction counts### 4. **Second Factor Status INIT Termination** - **Issue**: Sync sessions terminated when second factor status remained INIT- **Error**: \"Terminating sync session as the second factor status is still INIT\"## Problematic Flow Pattern:1. **Initial failure** occurs (gateway init, OTP verification, etc.)2. **Failure webhook** sent to merchant3. **Gateway polling** returns error with pending status4. **Merchant status check** receives \"authorizing/pending\" response5. **Later gateway webhook** provides actual success/failure status6. **Subsequent merchant polling** gets correct status ## Issues with Current Behavior:- Transactions incorrectly marked as failed when gateways had temporary issues- Status sync calls not initiated when they should have been - Async status checks performed even when transactions weren't initiated with gateways - Inconsistent handling of 5XX errors and timeouts during status synchronizationWhile the search results don't show explicit details of a recent deployment fix, they indicate ongoing discussions about:- Improving error handling for 5XX responses- Better distinction between business failures vs technical errors- Implementing proper sync logic for authentication failed scenarios- Restricting async status checks when transactions haven't been initiatedThe discussions suggest that fixes are being implemented to ensure gateway sync calls are properly initiated during high latency or error scenarios rather than immediately marking transactions as failed."

    "question": "What recent proposals have been made to improve the accuracy of transaction status reporting, both on the Euler dashboard and within the SDK?",
    "answer": "There are two main proposals to improve status reporting accuracy. First, for the Euler dashboard, it's suggested to handle non-error messages like 'COD Initiated' and 'UNKNOWN' on the dashboard side to avoid misrepresenting them as errors, without changing the API which could risk breaking merchant integrations. Second, for the SDK, the proposed best practice is to make a final 'payment-status' call just before the SDK exits to ensure it returns the most up-to-date transaction status, preventing cases where a stale status like 'authorizing' is shown after a transaction has already succeeded.",

    "answer": "Here is the status of the two fixes:\n\n1.  **Pinelabs UPI Token Issue:**\n    *   **Root Cause:** The `TOKEN_IS_NOT_VALID` error occurred because our system was URL-decoding the token received from Pinelabs, which incorrectly converted '+' characters into spaces. The fix was to stop decoding the token and send it as received.\n    *   **Status:** This fix has been deployed to production via a hotfix. Monitoring confirmed the issue is resolved.\n\n2.  **'Card bin not found' Error (Partial Captures):**\n    *   **Root Cause:** This error happened because the system was incorrectly using a card BIN to query the token BIN database table during the partial capture flow. This was due to a logic issue where a token BIN was replaced by a card BIN in a transaction object, but a related flag (`is_token_bin`) was not updated.\n    *   **Status:** The fix was successfully deployed and tested in the sandbox.

During the Accept Payment API call, Juspay receives a token from Pinelabs in URL-encoded format, but before calling the Process Payment API, this token was being URL-decoded, restoring special characters like '+', '=', '/'. When the Process Payment API hits Pinelabs, their network layer replaces the '+' in the token with a space, resulting in a TOKEN_IS_NOT_VALID error .**Impact**: Approximately 4-5% of transactions were affected daily .**Solution Status**: There was verification that \"the token issue is not reproduced now\" for UPI INTENT flow , suggesting the fix was implemented. However, the exact production deployment status is not explicitly confirmed in the available context.## Card Bin Not Found Error (Partial Captures)**Root Cause**: The issue occurs in the partial capture flow when:1. Parent transaction's txn_card_info is fetched and tokenBin is replaced with cardBin using `replaceTokenBinWithCardIsin` function 2. The payment source still has `is_token_bin` as true 3. When creating child txn_card_info for partial capture, the system uses parent's object but calls `replaceTokenBinWithCardIsin` again 4. The function checks for token bin flag (true) but tries to use cardBin as tokenBin to fetch from token_bin_info table, where no entry exists **Affected Transactions**: Multiple merchants reported this issue including Egencia team and testing with HDFCBANK_SMARTGATEWAY PG .**Error Details**: The error manifests as \"card bin not found for token bin\" with status \"internal_error\" .## Additional Context**Auth Token Expiration**: There were also issues with Pinelabs auth tokens expiring frequently, causing \"Token claims invalid: [\"exp\"]=\"token expired\"\" errors . This required manual token refresh by the team .**Production Status**: While the root causes have been identified, the context doesn't provide explicit confirmation that all fixes are live in production.

This caused problems because Pinelabs' network layer validation would replace '+' characters in the token with spaces, resulting in TOKEN_IS_NOT_VALID errors.**Status:** The fix appears to have been implemented and verified. A team member confirmed that \"the token issue is not reproduced now\" for the UPI INTENT flow for Pinelabs, and the intent UPI deeplink is being produced successfully.**Impact:** The issue was affecting approximately 4-5% of transactions daily before the fix was implemented.**Additional Issues:** There are still some ongoing token-related issues:- Token expiry issues in sandbox environments - Token refresh failures - Issues with shared MIDs across merchants in sandbox ## Card Bin Not Found Error for Partial Captures**Root Cause:** The search results show multiple instances of \"card bin not found for token bin\" errors occurring during partial capture attempts, but the specific root cause analysis is not detailed in the available context.**Current Status:** The issue appears to be ongoing based on the search results.

    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the search results, I can see several significant issues with gateway integrations, particularly around syncing and transaction initiation. Let me provide a comprehensive overview of the recent issues and fixes being worked on:## Recent Gateway Integration Issues### 1. Transaction Initiation Timeout IssuesOne of the major issues identified is **transaction initiation timeouts** where requests to gateways time out and transactions don't get registered at the payment gateway's end . This leads to:- TXN_SYNC calls receiving \"No Such Transaction Found\" responses with status \"Invalid\" and response code \"300\"- Transactions staying in their previous status instead of failing properly- Need for code changes to handle this error type correctly### 2. Premature Syncing Before Transaction InitiationA critical issue where the system **syncs with gateways before actually initiating transactions** to them . This creates:- \"Failure to success\" scenarios leading to auto-refunds- Confusion in transaction flows- Unnecessary resource waste- False positive transaction outcomes### 3. Gateway-Specific Sync Timing IssuesSeveral gateways have specific timing requirements that weren't being respected:**LOANTAP Gateway**: BigBasket faced ~10% failure-to-success issues due to default PT sync being changed from 5 minutes to 90 seconds. LOANTAP expects syncing only after callback response or after 5 minutes .**SBI Gateway**: Similar issues where the gateway gives failure responses if synced before the first 5 minutes of transaction creation .### 4. Customer Hash Handling IssuesWhen initiation fails to gateway, the system doesn't receive customerHash from the payment gateway, leading to second factor update failures and exceptions during sync calls .## Fixes and Improvements Being Worked On### 1. Preventing Premature Sync**Solution in Progress**: Implementation of checks to ensure transactions are only synced with gateways **after proper initiation** . The proposed approach involves:- Checking second_factor status before allowing sync- Only syncing when transaction status has changed to \"Pending\" - Introducing new error codes and messages for better handling### 2. Gateway-Specific Sync Configurations**Active Fixes**:- Adding `PT_TXN_SYNC_FREQUENCY_MAPPINGS_LOANTAP` to start PT sync after 5 minutes for LOANTAP gateway - Defining customized PT SYNC for SBI gateway starting from 300 seconds - Enabling proper sync configurations for specific gateways like SBI under `sync_enabled_gateway_for_redirection`### 3. Enhanced Error Handling**Improvements Include**:- Better handling of \"No Such Transaction Found\" responses- Proper transaction status updates when initiation fails- Implementation of unified error codes to avoid false failure-to-success cases ### 4. AMEX Void Initiation Enhancement**Phase I Completed**: For AMEX AUTH_AND_SETTLE transactions, when receiving `AUTHORIZED` status during sync, the system now initiates void calls to unblock customer funds and sets status as `AUTHORIZATION_FAILED` .**Phase II Planned**: Adding void retry support in sync flow for failed void calls.### 5. Systematic Integration ImprovementsRecognition of broader integration quality issues has led to initiatives for:- Proper SOPs for each integration- Better end-to-end testing from Juspay's side- Improved checklists for new PG integrations ### 6. Transaction Analytics and Monitoring**Planned Improvements** :- Enhanced dashboard with API latency, routing info, and silent retry information- Revamped audit trails- Better transaction analytics that are merchant-friendly- Improved testing for new payment method enablementThese fixes address critical reliability issues that have been causing transaction discrepancies, unnecessary refunds, and merchant escalations. The team is actively working on implementing these solutions to improve overall gateway integration stability and reliability."

This issue has been raised to them multiple times, but they have not addressed it. The issue was confirmed to be on ICICI Prudential's server side, not Juspay's internal systems .## ICICI NB Gateway Error MessagesThe `icicipru` merchant raised concerns about unhelpful error messages from the ICICINB payment gateway .

ICICI Bank Debit Card Gateway Integration Issue **Problem**: ICICIPru merchant was testing one-time Debit Card transactions in sandbox environment pointing to Production TPSL gateway, but transactions were failing with the error: **\"0399: Tariff not defined for bank for payment code\"****Root Cause**: Incorrect bank code being passed to the gateway- **Configured codes**: Scheme Code: FIRST, Debit Card Bank Code: 1350 - **Actual bank code received at gateway**: 9120 (incorrect)- **Sample Order ID**: 1068635The issue was caused by a mismatch between the configured bank code (1350) and the actual code being sent to the TPSL gateway (9120), likely due to incorrect mapping in the payment processing logic.### 2. ICICI Netbanking Error Message Quality Issue **Problem**: ICICIPru merchant complained that error messages from ICICINB payment gateway were not useful for analysis, making it difficult to troubleshoot failed transactions.**Root Cause**: - ICICINB gateway was unable to provide proper failure reasons in status checks- The same terminal implemented via Razorpay gateway provided clear error messages, but direct ICICI integration lacked detailed error reporting- This became a blocker for ICICIPru's plan to move their ICICI NB traffic to direct integration### 3. Card Transaction Failure with Insufficient Funds **Problem**: A recent transaction failure for ICICIPru showing gateway response issues.**Root Cause**: Based on the gateway response logs, the transaction failed due to:- **Gateway Code**: \"INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS\" - **Transaction Amount**: 39,538 INR- **Order ID**: icicipru-33057049-1- **Result**: \"FAILURE\"This was a legitimate business decline due to insufficient customer funds, not a technical gateway issue.## Common Patterns and RecommendationsThe issues identified show a pattern of:1. **Configuration mismatches** between expected and actual gateway parameters2. **Poor error messaging** from certain gateway integrations 3. **Standard business declines** being confused with technical issues**Key Recommendations** for ICICIPru:1. Audit and validate all gateway configuration mappings, especially bank codes2. Implement enhanced error parsing and reporting for better merchant visibility3. Consider gateway alternatives that provide clearer error messaging for operational efficiency4.

However, this analysis was later corrected - the actual issue was that notifications were created but sync gave 429 errors .**Paytm Gateway Limitations**: Users experienced transaction failures when Paytm had a GMV limit breach at their end . Since most users did UPI Intent and only had Paytm available, transactions were not routed to any other gateway to mitigate this issue .**Limited Gateway Support for Specific Flows**: For merchants like those using EASEBUZZ for UPI and PHONEPE for Card transactions , there are constraints in gateway routing that can impact transaction success rates.## Card EMI Mandate Flow Limitations:**STARTED State Transaction Issues**: Multiple tickets have been raised by merchants where EMI+ Mandate flow transactions get stuck in STARTED state . The major issue is insufficient communication between backend and frontend, with APIs like List Card and Card Info lacking visibility on order details .**Gateway Compatibility Problems**: - Card bins can be supported for mandates for a merchant, but the underlying payment gateway might not support the mandate + token repeat flow - EMI is enabled for a bank via a PG, but the PG doesn't support EMI+ Token repeat, causing STARTED state transactions - EMI is enabled for a bank via a PG that supports EMI+ Token repeat, but the card brand is not enabled under that PG **AMEX and RuPay Specific Issues**: - AMEX card EMI transactions face issues because issuers decline these transactions due to Juspay doing tokenization while other PGs do authorization - RuPay cards are not supported by some gateways like PayU, yet support was somehow added initially - AMEX co-branded cards are also not supported, creating bin mismatch issues **API Response Limitations**: - Card Info API checks if card bins are eligible for mandates irrespective of whether the card brand is enabled under the PG or gateway ref id - List Card API shows token repeat flow on UI even when merchants don't have any gateway supporting the flow - EMI Plans API shares gateway and gateway ref id but doesn't share card brands enabled under that PG **Eligibility API Issues**: For merchants enabled for Eligibility API, the API is not being called with should_create_mandate as false when it fails with should_create_mandate as true for OPTIONAL flow, leading to user errors and ambiguity .",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive overview of the recent issues encountered related to gateway selection for UPI transactions and Card EMI mandate flows:## Recent Gateway Selection Issues for UPI Transactions### 1. UPI Collect Gateway Selection ProblemsSeveral merchants have encountered a critical issue where UPI collect transactions fail with the error **\"Can't find a suitable gateway to process the transaction\"** despite having proper gateway configurations :- **Croma_CUG (Sandbox)**: UPI collect transactions failing despite having Razorpay configured for UPI collect- **TataAIA (Sandbox)**: Similar issue with PayU configuration for gateway ref ID \"LEADTOISSUANCE\"### 2. CCAvenue Traffic Routing IssuesBestprice is experiencing a significant gateway selection problem where CCAvenue isn't receiving traffic for UPI transactions despite being set as first priority :- CCAvenue reports zero traffic on their end while few transactions are routed but fail with \"No record found\" errors- This causes gateway score reduction, leading to traffic being redirected to Easebuzz instead- Issue appears to be an integration problem with form posting not reaching CCAvenue's servers### 3. BILLDESK UPI Transaction State IssuesVodafone app reported a major spike in transactions stuck in \"Authorizing\" status for BILLDESK UPI and netbanking :- **Trend escalation**: May (28) → June (41,902) → July (98,241)- Transactions with error code `0002` and response \"pending. Transaction Pending\" not moving to terminal state- Issue particularly affects Intent transactions and requires manual gateway sync to resolve### 4. Gateway Score and Routing Algorithm IssuesThe routing algorithm faces challenges especially with UPI collect, which is noted as \"generally a problem\" . The system has implemented the same routing algorithm as transaction routing for VPA verification, but accuracy needs monitoring and works only with redundancy.## Card EMI Mandate Flow Limitations### 1. Lack of Granular ControlMerchants face significant limitations in controlling which card bins are enabled for mandates:- When merchants enable card mandates, the flag enables mandates for ALL eligible card bins without merchant control over specific bins- This creates issues when merchants want selective mandate support### 2. Gateway-Specific EMI + Mandate Support IssuesCritical problems exist with EMI + Mandate flows:- Card bins supported by CCAVENUE_V2 are the only ones eligible for the flow- The card info API lacks context about this limitation and responds with general mandate support- This leads to transactions getting stuck in STARTED state### 3. Eligibility API Flow ProblemsFor merchants enabled with Eligibility API:- When the API fails with `should_create_mandate=true` for OPTIONAL flow, it doesn't retry with `should_create_mandate=false`- Users are shown errors on UI, creating ambiguity and poor user experience### 4. Brand-Specific LimitationsSpecific issues identified with card brands:- **AMEX cards**: Problems with saved card token mandate setup across merchants- **RuPay cards**: PayU doesn't support RuPay cards, but support was somehow enabled- **AMEX co-branded cards**: Bin mismatch issues due to lack of proper synchronization with PayU for supported bins## Systemic Issues and RecommendationsThe analysis reveals that **UPI collect flow is facing structural challenges**, with NPCI planning to remove the collect flow entirely. The recommendation is to show UPI QR by default and keep UPI collect hidden until NPCI officially discontinues it .These issues highlight the need for:1. Better gateway configuration validation2. Improved routing algorithms with proper fallback mechanisms3. More granular merchant controls for mandate flows4. Enhanced synchronization between Juspay and payment gateway configurations"

    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the recent discussions, there are several significant issues that have impacted merchants, particularly around split payments and platform stability:## Split Payment SR Calculation Issues**TWID Integration Problem**: There's a major issue in the split payment refunds flow between TWID and Juspay where TWID is passing incorrect refund amount values . The problem occurs during `/refundInquiry` calls where TWID returns wrong values for `pg_refund_request` and `points_refund_request`. For example, with Order ID o-54246219-r616kn (manmatters), TWID calculated refundable amount as 2114.10 - 699.25 = 1414.85, but the correct calculation should be (2114.10 - 44.0) - 699.25 = 1370.75 .**SR Calculation Discrepancies**: Multiple payment gateways including PAYU and CAMSPAY have reported issues where SR at their end appears good, but on Juspay's end, the same PG shows low SR . This is mainly due to transactions where Juspay didn't receive the `/v2/pay/start` hit from merchants and didn't initiate transactions to the gateway, but eventually marked them as AUTHENTICATION_FAILED .**Split Transaction SR Issues**: When one transaction in a split payment gets marked as \"Authz Failed\", the other transaction remains in \"Started\" state, leading to lower SR reporting at Juspay's end when the transaction actually didn't hit the gateway . This affects SR-based routing as less traffic gets routed to these gateways .## Refund Processing Problems**Incorrect Refund Amounts**: For TimesPrime merchant in Sandbox environment, refunds for split payment orders are being initiated based on total transaction amount instead of the exact amount processed for each individual transaction . For example, with Order ID KSAQ5524TURI7285MQRQ, the system attempted to refund ₹886 instead of ₹885 for a Razorpay transaction, causing gateway failures .**Core Calculation Issues**: Split payments refund calculations have been problematic since inception, with incorrect `parentTxnAmount` calculation where `netAmount - txnAmount` happens but `txnAmount` is not inclusive of offers, leading to incorrect `childRefAmount` .## Platform Instability Issues**Testing Environment Problems**: There have been critical testing issues affecting merchants, with mentions of adding merchants to \"disableAny\" configurations and enabling \"all false\" settings to address testing problems .**Horizontal Changes Impact**: Several horizontal changes have caused merchant impacts including Money Framework issues (affecting PayU and CCA), removal of config to route transactions to api-gateway by default, and new feature launches affecting existing flows like co-badged card features impacting existing traffic .**Gateway Integration Issues**: There have been problems with payment gateway credentials and testing capabilities, with teams having to escalate issues via WhatsApp and email to resolve credential problems that prevent both backend and frontend testing .These issues collectively represent significant challenges for merchants, particularly those using split payment functionality, and highlight the need for better testing protocols and more robust SR calculation methods.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive overview of recent merchant issues, particularly focusing on split-payment SR calculation problems and platform instability:## Recent Merchant Issues### Split-Payment SR Calculation Problems**1. Core SR Calculation Issue in Split Transactions** - **Problem**: When one transaction in a split-payment gets marked as \"Authz Failed,\" the other transaction remains in \"Started\" state, leading to incorrect SR reporting at Juspay's end- **Impact**: The transaction didn't actually hit the gateway but is still counted, causing lower SR calculations- **Proposed Solution**: Remove such transactions from dashboard metrics using the logic: \"If Split-payment, txn status is Started, second_factor = init → Do not consider in SR calculation\"**2. Manmatters Split-Payment Analytics Issue** - **Merchant**: Manmatters- **Problem**: Two separate transaction entries created with different gateways (TWID Rewards + RZP/YES_BIZ)- **Issue**: When RZP/YES_BIZ fails, TWID transaction stays in \"started\" state but gets included in SR calculation despite not being initiated- **Sample Order**: o-54503128-bl6jae**3. High Drop-off Rate Impact on SR** - **Issue**: Merchant released a product with collection links where 90%+ transactions remain in pending state- **Impact on Elimination**: Threshold of 0.35 means 20 consecutive pending transactions lead to 0.3 score, causing all PGs to get eliminated- **Impact on SRV2**: Merchant not using SRV2 due to this product behavior### Split-Payment Refund Issues**1. TWID Split-Payment Refund Calculation Error** - **Merchant**: Manmatters - **Order**: o-54246219-r616kn- **Problem**: TWID passing incorrect refund amount values to Juspay during `/refundInquiry` calls- **Current Error**: `2114.10 - 699.25 = 1414.85`- **Expected**: `(2114.10 - 44.0) - 699.25 = 1370.75`- **Status**: Working with TWID to fix; considering migrating calculation entirely to Juspay**2. Split-Payment Code Issue with Offers** - **Problem**: Split payments not handled properly when offers are applied- **Issue**: During `parentTxnAmount` calculation, `txnAmount` excludes offer amount, leading to incorrect calculations- **Impact**: Incorrect `parentTxnAmount` and `childRefAmount` calculations**3. AJIO Split Settlement Refund Mismatch** - **Merchant**: AJIO- **Problem**: \"Split info provided has amount mismatch with actual transaction amount\" error- **Issue**: Despite mismatch error, system marks refund as pending and initiates to PG instead of failing- **Original Amount**: 3292.59, **Settlement Amount**: 399### Platform Instability Issues**1. Gateway Downtime Impact**- **Axis Biz Gateway**: September 8, 12AM-2AM IST downtime- **Stats**: Out of 4,375 transactions, only 1,731 successful (~60% failure rate)- **Failure Types**: ResponseTimeout (680), Request Not Found (532), Request Expired (289)**2. Split Request Implementation Issues** - **Merchants**: idea_preprod, others- **Problem**: When merchants want full settlement in marketplace account, empty `splitRequest {}` sent to PayU- **Impact**: PayU processes without split, causing refund issues later- **Order**: PRE1652828533860273### Recommendations1. **Immediate**: Fix SR calculation logic to exclude split-payment transactions in \"Started\" state2. **Short-term**: Migrate TWID refund calculations to Juspay to eliminate dependency3. **Medium-term**: Enhance retry mechanisms with proper error distinction and exponential backoff4. **Long-term**: Implement circuit breakers and better monitoring for gateway outagesThese issues highlight the need for better split-payment handling, more robust SR calculation methodology, and improved platform stability monitoring."

    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on your team's past experiences with payment provider integrations, here are the key data mappings and configurations you'll likely need to handle for your new payment provider:## Critical Data Mappings### 1. **Transaction Reference Mappings**- **Internal Transaction ID** to **Provider Transaction ID** - Example: `epgTxnId` mapping to `payments.id` (like `v1-250722102810-aa-9TWlk9-cc-a`)- **Provider ARN/RRN Fields** - Map provider's `arn` field from refund responses to your internal `refundArn` - Example: HYPER_PG returns `arn: \"434871125398\"` in refund block### 2. **Acquirer Data Structure** Your team standardizes acquirer response fields:```json\"acquirer_data\": { \"approval_code\": \"022618\", \"acquirer_reference\": \"52360000000234875361\", \"rrn\": \"523612314944\", \"is_aggregator\": true, \"acquirer_name\": \"RBL\", \"arn\": \"null\"}```### 3. **UDF Parameter Mapping** For providers like PINELABS, your team maps UDFs in the `udf_data` parameter:```haskelludf_data = just $ makeUdfParams orderReference omv2```## Provider-Specific Configurations### 4. **Amazon Pay Integration** - **V2 Integration Flag**: Used for sending metadata details to Amazon- **Metadata Handling**: Ensure proper metadata structure for backward compatibility with older SDKs- **PayFort Card Mandates**: For recurring transactions, implement subscription flow per PayFort documentation### 5. **EMI/Tenure Data Structure** Critical for credit providers - ensure your data model handles:```haskelldata Tenure = Tenure { tenure_id :: Text , details :: [Detail] -- Often missing in provider responses! , processing_fee_details :: Maybe ProcessingFeeDetails , interest_rate_percentage :: Double }```### 6. **Seamless Integration Forms** For wallet providers like EASEBUZZ, handle form-based redirects:```html<form action='https://pay.easebuzz.in/initiate_seamless_payment/' method='POST'> <input type='hidden' name='access_key' value='...'/> <input type='hidden' name='payment_mode' value='MW'/> <input type='hidden' name='bank_code' value='PHONEPE'/></form>```## Data Validation Considerations### 7. **Missing Field Handling** Always make fields optional that providers might not return:- `details` array in tenure objects- `arn` fields (sometimes returned as \"null\" string)- Various filtered/masked fields in responses### 8. **Response Field Mapping** Your team maintains extensive field mappings for analytics. Ensure your provider supports these common fields:- `payment_method_type`, `auth_code`, `card_bin`- `mandate_status`, `emi_tenure`, `gateway_reference_id`- `offer_total_discount_amount`, `processing_fee_amount`### 9. **Card Network Data** For card networks, ensure proper mapping of:- Wallet support indicators- Consumer finance options - Network-specific metadata## Recommendations1. **Start with Core Mappings**: Focus on transaction ID, status, and amount mappings first2. **Handle Missing Fields Gracefully**: Make most response fields optional in your data models3. **Test Edge Cases**: Providers often return inconsistent data formats (strings vs nulls)4. **Document Provider Quirks**: Each provider has unique requirements (like PINELABS missing `details` field)5. **Implement Robust Error Handling**: Payment responses can fail decoding due to unexpected field structuresThis should give you a solid foundation based on your team's real-world integration experiences!"

The code was only handling success cases, and when an error response was received, it resulted in a decode error.**Specific Response**: The Shopse transaction API returned:```json \"status\": 500, \"path\": \"FILTERED\", \"error\": \"Internal Server Error\", \"message\": \"Provider is unavailable, please connect with the merchant\", \"timestamp\": \"2024-07-08T10:41:09.910+0000\"}```**Technical Details**: The decode error occurred because there was a `MISSING_FIELD` error for the \"orderId\" field in the Shopse transaction API response . The error was incorrectly mapped to the response_message in PGR, which meant merchants could see this technical error on their dashboard and in API responses.## ETA/Resolution TimelineBased on the available information, I couldn't find a specific ETA mentioned for this particular Shopse DECODE_ERROR. However, there are references to ongoing efforts to fix decode errors systematically:- Sandeep Reddy mentioned that instead of fixing issues gateway by gateway, they were discussing fixing all gateways' code at once using a 'code as data' approach - Malav initiated a thread to \"eliminate decode errors fully\" and suggested using code-as-data and LLM to refactor mandatory fields that aren't referenced in the code ## Alerting Logic AssessmentRegarding whether this type of error would trigger a real-time SEV alert based on current alerting logic:**Likely YES** - DECODE_ERROR would trigger alerts because:1. The search results show that SEV1 alerts are triggered for 500 errors and INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR responses, which is what the Shopse gateway returned [search results show \"We are encountering sev1 alerts where /txns is failing with 'INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR', res code: 500\"]2. The system appears to have alerting in place for transaction failures and gateway errors, as evidenced by multiple references to alerts for similar error conditions3. However, the alerting might categorize this as a general 500 error rather than specifically identifying it as a decode error, since the underlying issue was the gateway's 500 response that wasn't properly handled.The DECODE_ERROR itself appears to be a symptom of improper error handling rather than the root cause, so the alert would likely trigger on the HTTP 500 status from the gateway rather than the subsequent decode failure."

    "answer": "The issue of refunds getting stuck due to unexpected gateway responses is a known problem. The team's strategy for the refunds workflow is to use a deterministic approach with standardized email templates, which have been created for responding to both single and multiple orders. For well-defined failure cases, the plan is to identify the scenario and use a specific template for an automated action, such as emailing the Payment Gateway to ask why the failure occurred. This templated method is preferred for refunds, while AI/LLMs are being used more for drafting responses to transaction-related queries that have greater variation.",

AI-Driven Strategy (Experimental/Future)** The team has proposed an AI-based approach for handling unhandled cases where automated emails are not sent:- Create \"context\" by storing ticket details JSON and solution algorithms in English sentences- When new unhandled tickets come in, the system generates English sentence-based algorithms- These algorithms become prompts that are reviewed and edited by humans- Vision: \"unhandled ticket comes → AI creates an algorithm → AI generates code → Human review → Merge to live workflow\"**2. Current Templated Workflow Approach** The team has deployed multi-step workflow support that:- Splits complex single-step workflows into multiple manageable steps- Provides visual separation of steps and logical paths- Makes debugging easier by pinpointing exactly where execution fails- Reduces timeouts by breaking API calls out of loops### **External Dependencies Challenge** **Key finding**: Most refund workflow failures are attributed to **external dependencies** rather than internal issues:- Unavailability of logs- Logviewer not responding - Zoho API errors- Gateway response issuesThe team acknowledges there's \"limited scope for significant increase in success percentage\" due to these external factors, though they're \"actively exploring ways to better handle these external cases.\"### **Current Performance & Strategy** **Current stable automated reply percentage is 40%** for refunds. Recent progress shows:- **51% accuracy** in generating draft outputs without manual intervention- Team is working on \"low hanging fruits\" that could increase accuracy to ~70%- **~30% of total refund tickets** are being completely auto-closed (42 out of 145 tickets in a 10-day period)### **Approach for Gateway Response Errors**While the specific \"Unexpected Response from Gateway\" error isn't directly addressed in the recent discussions, the team's strategy focuses on:1. **Better error handling** through multi-step workflows that can isolate where failures occur2. **Improved external dependency management** 3. **Gradual coverage expansion** through both templated logic and AI-assisted algorithm generationThe current approach appears to be primarily **templated/deterministic** for production use, with **AI integration being experimental** and focused on generating new handling logic for previously unhandled cases."

    "answer": "There were two recent, distinct issues:\n\n1.  **Hyperpay Webhook Decryption Failure:** For merchant `gabit`, webhooks were failing with a 400 error. The root cause was that the system could not decrypt the webhook request because the necessary secret key was not configured. The fix was to update the gateway schema to make the secret key a mandatory field for webhooks to prevent this from being missed in the future.\n\n2.  **Stuck Refunds Logic Failure:** Some refunds were getting stuck in a pending state and moving to manual review. This happened when a 'transaction declined by beneficiary bank' error occurred. Although this error is configured for retry, the system's logic prevented the retry because an `epg txn id` was already present. The proposed product fix is to change the logic so that if an `epg txn id` exists and the error is retryable, the transaction is moved to 'Failure', allowing the merchant to re-initiate it.",

    ],
    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the retrieved context, here are the key production issues related to decryption and system logic failures:## Hyperpay Webhook Decryption Issue**Cause:** The issue was due to decryption failure where webhooks received were getting rejected for the merchant and gateway . The root cause was that the gateway (CCAVENUE_V2) was encrypting the payload using different working keys - sometimes \"Working Key 1\" and other times \"Working Key 2\". Since \"Working Key 2\" was not configured on the dashboard, the decryption was failing for some cases .**Example Error:** When attempting to decrypt HyperPay's webhook request, the system returned \"Unable to decrypt HyperPay's webhook request\" with error \"Invalid request params. Please verify your input\" .## RRN and ARN Mapping Issue for Hyperpay**Cause:** RRN and ARN were not being mapped for gateway Hyperpay . The issue was initially raised by the UrbanClap team who required ARN for refunds. Upon investigation, it was found that:- Hyperpay sends RRN in the `transaction.receipt` field within the webhook- Since the webhook request body is encrypted, direct verification in logs was not possible- The system performs a mandatory sync with the gateway after receiving the webhook, and RRN was found in the sync response within `resultDetails` **Proposed Fix:** Map `transaction.receipt` to RRN, and in the case of refunds, map it further to ARN .## Refund Status Issues**Problem 1 - CRED Status Mismatch:** There was interference with the status sent by CRED, where refund/transaction status (a sacrosanct field) was being modified instead of just forwarding what the PA/PG sends. This affected 4000 orders from January till May 26th .**Problem 2 - ORDER_SUCCEEDED Webhook for Auto-Refunded Cases:** A bug caused by a PR raised on April 28th sent ORDER_SUCCEEDED webhooks for auto-refunded cases, circumventing all checks and balances in the framework .**Problem 3 - Refund Status Mapping Error:** A refund was marked as Success when it was actually a Failure on the gateway's side. The sequence involved:- Refund initiated with gateway- Sync performed post-initiation incorrectly updated status as Success- ORDER_SUCCEEDED webhook triggered to merchant- Subsequent syncs showed actual status as Failure, but status wasn't updated since it was already marked as Success ## PAYU Split Settlement Refund Failures**Cause:** Refunds were failing with \"Refund token already used\" error for PAYU split settlement. The issues included:- Multiple partial refunds of the same amount being initiated for a single order- PAYU doesn't allow multiple refunds of the same amount within 5 minutes- System retrying failed refunds with the same unique request ID, which PAYU doesn't accept- Since this specific error wasn't mapped, refunds were incorrectly marked as pending with repeated sync attempts **Proposed Solution:** Implement a check to delay refund attempts of the same amount for a particular order by at least 5 minutes .## General Fixes and RecommendationsFor visibility and logging issues, proposed solutions included:- Unfilter keys which are only numeric by default for PayU- Store latest refund initiate & latest refund sync responses in PGR for Billdesk & other PGs- Log all decode failures and give default Pending status when unable to decode responses",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the search results, I can now provide a comprehensive summary of both production issues you mentioned. Here's what I found:## Summary of Recent Production Issues### 1. Hyperpay Webhook Decryption Issue**Root Cause:**- The issue was due to **decryption failure** for Hyperpay webhooks - The gateway was encrypting payloads using different working keys (`Working Key 1` in some cases and `Working Key 2` in others) - Since `Working Key 2` was not configured on the dashboard, decryption was failing for transactions using that key **Symptoms:**- Most webhooks received were getting rejected for the merchant and gateway - Error response: \"Unable to decrypt HyperPay's webhook request\" with \"Invalid webhook response\" - The webhook URL `https://sandbox.juspay.in/v2/pay/webhooks/gabit/hyperpay/` was returning 400 responses **Additional Related Issue:**- There was also a separate Hyperpay issue where **RRN and ARN were not being mapped** properly - This was initially raised by the UrbanClap team who required ARN for refunds - Hyperpay sends RRN in the `transaction.receipt` field within webhooks, but since webhook requests are encrypted, this couldn't be directly verified **Proposed Fix:**- For the RRN/ARN mapping issue: Map `transaction.receipt` to RRN, and for refunds, map it further to ARN - The team performed mandatory sync with the gateway after receiving webhooks to get the transaction receipt from `resultDetails` ### 2. Stuck Refunds / Incorrect Status Mapping Issues**Root Cause - Issue 1 (Zeptomarketplace):**- A refund was **incorrectly marked as Success** on Juspay's end when it was actually a **Failure** on the gateway's side [search result]- The sequence was: 1. Refund initiated with gateway 2. Post-initiation sync incorrectly updated status as Success 3. `order.refunded` webhook was triggered to merchant 4. Subsequent syncs returned actual status as Failure 5. **System didn't update the status** because it was already marked as Success**Root Cause - Issue 2 (AJIO Split Settlement):**- System logic failure in split settlement refunds where despite detecting amount mismatches, the system continued processing refunds instead of failing them [search result]- Error: \"Split info provided has amount mismatch with actual transaction amount\"- **Unexpected behavior**: Instead of failing the refund due to mismatch, the system marked it as pending and initiated refund to PG**Root Cause - Issue 3 (PAY10 Gateway):**- Refund status incorrectly mapped as **failed** on Juspay's end when gateway reported success [search result]- Issue with response signature validation and lack of GSM mapping for PAY10 refunds- Gateway confirmed refund status as success, but Juspay system showed failure**Current Status:**- Multiple JIRA tickets created for tracking these issues (EUL-15798, EUL-16917)- Investigation ongoing with various team members tagged for resolutionThese issues highlight systemic problems with webhook decryption configuration, refund status synchronization logic, and gateway response mapping that need immediate attention to prevent merchant and customer impact."

    "question": "What were the root causes and resolutions for the recent 'connection refused' errors during deployments and the surcharge display issue for the 'oolka' merchant?",
    "answer": "The 'connection refused' errors were caused by the deployment process killing pods during initialization due to incorrect replica scaling. This was fixed by setting the initial replica count to 1 and adding a scheduler warmup.\n\nThe surcharge display issue for the 'oolka' merchant was caused by a missing frontend configuration. The problem was resolved by adding the `applyGatewayFilter: true` setting, and it was suggested this be made the default in the future.",

    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the retrieved context, here are the root causes and resolutions for both issues:## Connection Refused Errors During Deployments**Root Cause:** The connection refused errors occurred during AP (Application Platform) deployments due to a scaling issue . When AP starts deployment, it creates a new deployment file from the older running version with replicas equal to the number of currently running pods. The system then tries to scale up to that number but immediately scales down to 1 pod, killing all other pods except one. However, the pods were not in 'running' state but in 'initializing' state, yet the scheduler starts running immediately without depending on API calls .**Technical Context:** Connection refused errors should only come from the destination, and source restarts on unavailability typically result in timeouts or 0DC rather than connection refused . The issue was specifically related to outgoing calls to api-gateway/order-status during the deployment process .**Resolution/Action Items:**1. AP will have initial replicas set to 1 rather than the max pods from the older deployment 2. Implement initial warmup in scheduler so it doesn't start running immediately when the deployment file is applied ## Surcharge Display Issue for 'oolka' Merchant**Root Cause:** The surcharge was being applied on the backend, but the text was not being displayed on the Payment Page (PP) . The frontend configurations were pushed in CUG, but from the SPM call, it was observed that the surcharge was not being received from the backend .**Technical Details:** This appears to be a backend-to-frontend communication issue where the surcharge calculation was working correctly on the backend but wasn't being properly transmitted to display on the payment page.**Status:** The issue was reported for merchant 'oolka' integrating surcharge in sandbox environment, with Order ID: 202508193941bcd9d33e . The team was actively investigating and requested help to check the backend surcharge transmission.Both issues represent different types of system problems - one related to deployment orchestration and pod lifecycle management, and the other related to data flow between backend services and frontend display components.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the search results, I can provide information about both issues you asked about:## Connection Refused Errors During Deployments**Root Cause Analysis:**The connection refused errors during deployments were caused by issues in the deployment process itself . According to Priyanshi Mittal's analysis:1. **Deployment Process Issue**: When AP (presumably deployment system) starts deployment, it creates a new deployment file from the older version that's running, with replicas equal to the number of pods running at that moment .2. **Pod Scaling Problem**: The deployment file tries to scale up the number of pods mentioned in the replica field, but the next command scales pods to 1, causing all other pods except 1 to be killed .3. **Scheduler Timing Issue**: Pods were not in `running` state but were in initializing state, yet the scheduler started running because it doesn't depend on any API call .4. **Connection Logic**: The connection refused errors were puzzling because these were outgoing calls to api-gateway/order-status, but the consumer (sending requests) went down, not the order-status/api-gateway service .**Resolution:**Two action items were identified to prevent these issues :1. **AP Configuration**: Set initial replicas to 1 rather than the max pods from the older deployment2. **Scheduler Warmup**: Implement initial warmup in scheduler so it doesn't start running immediately when the deployment file is applied## Oolka Merchant Surcharge Display Issue**Root Cause Analysis:**The oolka merchant was experiencing a surcharge display issue where [search result]:- The surcharge was being applied correctly on the backend (BE)- However, the surcharge text was not being displayed on the Payment Page (PP)- Frontend configurations were pushed in CUG- From SPM call observations, the surcharge was not being received from the backend**Technical Details:**- **Order ID**: 202508193941bcd9d33e- **Environment**: sandbox- **Issue**: Backend was applying surcharge but frontend wasn't receiving it for displayThis appears to be related to a broader pattern of surcharge-related issues affecting multiple merchants, where amount mismatches between Juspay and payment gateways (particularly PayU) cause transaction failures due to surcharge calculation discrepancies [search result].The issue requires investigation from both frontend and backend teams to ensure proper communication of surcharge information from BE to FE for display on the payment page."
