- **Issue:** Both systems failed to find the information, but old system provided more relevant search context

#### B. **Completeness Issues (-3.7%)**
The new system frequently misses parts of complex queries:

**Example Problem Case:**

**Query: "Provide a list of all JIRA tickets mentioned across emails and Slack messages related to RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness Program"**
- Old Score: 5.25/10
- New Score: 4.0/10

### 3. QUESTION TYPE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

#### A. **NEW System Performs BETTER on:**

**1. Definitive Technical Queries (Low Complexity)**
- Perfect scores on specific JIRA ticket lookups
- Excellent at extracting specific technical parameters
- Strong performance on configuration details

**Example:** "What was the threefold remediation plan detailed in document PAY-4637?"
- New Score: 10/10 vs Old baseline
- **Success Factor:** Direct document reference with specific technical steps

**2. Status Updates with Concrete Facts**
- Better at providing current system states
- More accurate on numerical metrics and thresholds

**Example:** NPCI relationship management queries scored 9.5/10
- **Success Factor:** Clear factual reporting of communication patterns

#### B. **OLD System Performs BETTER on:**

**1. Complex Inferential Questions**
- Better at synthesizing information from multiple sources
- More complete coverage of multi-part questions

**Example:** Risk scoring engine synthesis queries
- **Old System Advantage:** Provided more comprehensive root cause analysis

**2. High-Vagueness Questions Requiring Interpretation**
- More effective at handling ambiguous queries
- Better at providing contextual background

**3. Comprehensive Listing Tasks**
- More complete enumeration of items
- Better recall of historical information

## Critical Problem Areas for BOTH Systems

### 1. **Information Retrieval Failures**
Both systems struggle with:
- Finding specific meeting notes or document contents
- Locating archived communications
- Cross-referencing between different data sources

**Example Failure Pattern:**
Query: "What are the two architectural options for PAY-5422?"
- Both systems: Unable to locate the specific meeting documentation
- **Root Cause:** Search limitations in underlying data access

### 2. **Data Contradiction Issues**
Both systems occasionally provide conflicting information:
- Different JIRA ticket numbers for same issues
- Inconsistent error code reporting
- Conflicting timeline information

### 3. **Context Window Limitations**
Complex multi-part questions often lose important details:
- Missing secondary requirements in compound queries
- Incomplete coverage of all requested information
- Focus on first part of multi-part questions

## Conclusion

The new tool_revamp system represents a **focused improvement in factual accuracy** at the cost of some semantic flexibility and completeness. The +8.5% improvement in factuality is significant and valuable for technical queries, but the system loses some capability in comprehensive analysis and complex synthesis tasks.

**Strategic Recommendation:** Deploy both systems in complementary roles:
- **NEW system** for technical fact lookup, specific documentation queries, and precise information extraction
- **OLD system** for comprehensive analysis, risk assessment, and complex multi-source synthesis tasks

The marginal overall score improvement (+0.025%) masks important qualitative differences in system capabilities that should drive specific use-case optimization rather than wholesale replacement.
