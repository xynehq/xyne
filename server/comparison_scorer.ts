  const promptText = `You are an EXPERT COMPARISON EVALUATION SYSTEM designed to score and compare old vs new agentic answer quality for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Your task is to evaluate both answers against ground truth and provide precise comparative analysis.

CORE EVALUATION PRINCIPLES:

Objectivity First: Base scores on observable evidence, not assumptions

Consistency: Apply the same standards across all evaluations

Granularity & Differentiation: Use the full 1-10 scale with high sensitivity to differences. Score comparatively—compare both answers directly against each other and the ground truth simultaneously, not independently. Small differences in factual precision, relevance, or completeness must result in noticeable score differences (≥1 point difference). Avoid clustering around middle values or assigning similar scores unless both are equally strong.

Evidence-Based: Every score must be justified with specific examples

Comparative Analysis: Always compare both old_Agentic_answer and new_Agentic_answer head-to-head against ground truth (Answer field) before assigning scores. If one answer is moderately better, reflect with at least a 1-point gap.

SCORING CRITERIA:
Evaluate each answer pair on these TWO factors (scale 1-10). Each score must be an integer with clear justification.
CRITICAL: First verify that the answer actually addresses the specific question asked. Then evaluate factuality and completeness.

Factuality (1-10):

__Definition:__ Correctness and accuracy of information when compared to ground truth. Focus on identifying contradictions, verifying claims, and assessing information accuracy.

__Critical Evaluation Process:__

__Step 1: Identify Overlapping Topics__

- List all topics/facts mentioned in BOTH ground truth and agentic_answer
- These are your comparison points

__Step 2: Check for Contradictions__

- For each overlapping topic, verify if the information matches
- A contradiction = any factual claim that directly opposes ground truth
- Minor wording differences are NOT contradictions if meaning is preserved

__Step 3: Assess Additional Information__

- Information in agentic_answer NOT in ground truth: Neutral (doesn't affect score unless contradictory)
- Information in ground truth NOT in agentic_answer: Affects Completeness, not Factuality

__Detailed Scoring Rubric:__

__Score 10 (Perfect Factuality):__

- Zero contradictions with ground truth
- All overlapping information is accurate
- Any additional information (beyond ground truth) is verifiable and correct
- Example: Ground truth says "latency was 450ms" → Agentic answer says "latency reached 450ms" ✓

__Score 7-9 (High Factuality):__

- No direct contradictions
- Minor deviations in presentation but same core facts
- Slight differences in numerical precision that don't change meaning
- Example: Ground truth says "approximately 1,200 transactions" → Agentic answer says "around 1,200 transactions" ✓

__Score 4-6 (Moderate Factuality):__

- Mix of accurate and inaccurate information
- Some contradictions on secondary points
- Core facts correct but supporting details may be wrong
- Example: Correct error code but wrong timestamp or wrong person who reported it

__Score 1-3 (Poor Factuality):__

- Significant factual errors
- Direct contradictions on core information
- Misattributes actions, misquotes numbers, or fabricates details
- Example: Ground truth says "JIRA PAY-1234" → Agentic answer says "JIRA PAY-5678" ✗

__Special Cases:__

__Case A: Agentic answer has MORE detail than ground truth__

- If additional details don't contradict ground truth → Score based on accuracy of overlapping info
- Don't penalize for being more comprehensive

__Case B: Different but equivalent information__

- "OAuth token refresh failed" vs "Authentication token renewal error" → Same meaning, no penalty
- Focus on semantic equivalence, not exact wording

__Case C: Partial information__

- Ground truth: "Error codes U30, U39, and U68"
- Agentic answer: "Error codes U30 and U39"
- This is incomplete (affects Completeness score) but not inaccurate (Factuality remains high)

---
Completeness (1-10):

__Definition:__ How thoroughly the answer addresses all aspects of the question compared to the ground truth.

__Detailed Scoring Rubric:__

__Score 10 (Fully Complete):__

- Addresses every element mentioned in ground truth
- Covers all sub-questions or multi-part aspects
- No significant omissions
- Example: Question asks for "root cause, impact, and solution" → Answer provides all three

__Score 7-9 (Mostly Complete):__

- Covers all major points
- Minor gaps in supporting details
- May lack some examples or specifics present in ground truth
- Example: Provides root cause and solution but less detail on impact

__Score 4-6 (Partially Complete):__

- Addresses main question but misses important elements
- Significant gaps in coverage
- May focus on one aspect while neglecting others
- Example: Multi-part question answered only partially

__Score 1-3 (Incomplete):__

- Major gaps in addressing the question
- Superficial treatment of complex topics
- Misses most sub-questions or key elements
- Example: Question asks for list of 5 items, answer provides only 1-2

COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
After scoring both answers, perform detailed comparison:

Better Answer: Compare answers based on how well they address the specific question and their factuality/completeness scores

Overall Assessment: 2-3 sentence summary of which answer is better and why

Key Differences: List 3-5 specific differences between the answers, focusing on relevance to the question asked

OVERALL_SCORE CALCULATION: Calculate as the average of Factuality and Completeness scores: Overall_Score = (Factuality + Completeness) / 2. This should be a decimal number (e.g., 7.5, 6.0, 8.5).

REASON FIELD: Template: "Factuality scored [X] because [specific observation]. Completeness scored [Y] because [specific observation]. Overall_Score is [Z] (average of Factuality and Completeness)."

INSIGHTS FIELD: Structure with MISSING TRUTH, CONTRADICTIONS, DEVIATIONS, ADDITIONAL CONTEXT, and OVERALL assessment.

You must return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:

"key_differences": "1) ... 2) ... 3) ... 4) ..."
}
}
]
}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

Return ONLY valid JSON - No markdown, no code blocks, no explanations outside the JSON

Wrap in "results" array - Follow exact format above

Preserve all original fields exactly as provided in input

Use integer scores only (1-10, no decimals for Factuality and Completeness)

Ensure valid JSON syntax - No trailing commas, proper escaping

Input Data: ${JSON.stringify(batch, null, 2)}

For each item:

"Question" is the question being asked

"Answer" is the Ground Truth

"old_Agentic_answer" is the old answer to evaluate

"new_Agentic_answer" is the new answer to evaluate

Score both answers against the ground truth using Factuality and Completeness (with question alignment considered within these factors), then provide comparison analysis.`

🔄 Comparison Scorer - Compare Old vs New Agentic Answers

Usage: bun run comparison_scorer.ts [oldEvalFile] [newEvalFile] [outputFile]

Arguments:
  oldEvalFile   Path to the old agentic answers JSON file (default: ${DEFAULT_OLD_EVAL_FILE})
  newEvalFile   Path to the new agentic answers JSON file (default: ${DEFAULT_NEW_EVAL_FILE})  
  outputFile    Path to the output JSON file (default: ${DEFAULT_OUTPUT_FILE})

Options:
  --help, -h    Show this help message

Example:
  bun run comparison_scorer.ts api_agentic_answers.json tool_revamp_agentic.json comparison_results.json

This tool will:
1. Read both agentic answer files (old vs new)
2. Match questions between old and new answers
3. Score both answers using Factuality and Completeness (with question alignment considered within these factors)
4. Compare the answers and determine which is better
5. Save detailed comparison results with comprehensive summary statistics

The output will include:
- Individual scores for old and new answers with overall scores
- Comparison analysis determining which answer is better
- Detailed insights about differences between answers
- Summary statistics about overall performance
- All results saved directly in the output file for further analysis
