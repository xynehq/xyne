The problem occurs because:1. **Missing Authentication Account Configuration**: The merchant `hyperupi` (which appears to be related to `swiggy-nf`) does not have the `YES_BIZ` authentication account properly set up in the system.2. **PSP Mismatch**: When making `/upi/inapp` session params calls, the system is checking for an authentication account for the PSP `YES_BIZ`, but this authentication account is not configured for the merchant in question.3. **Configuration Gap**: Although the dashboard showed that an auth account was configured, there was a gap specifically for the `YES_BIZ` PSP authentication account setup.## Resolution StatusFrom the Slack conversations found, the issue was escalated to the appropriate teams with the following actions:- The issue was raised to be addressed with the merchant (Swiggy) team- The team identified that a `YES_BIZ` authentication account needed to be set up for the merchant- This was escalated to @Surya and @Utkarsh Gupta for merchant configurationHowever, I don't see a definitive confirmation in the current search results that this specific issue has been fully resolved. ## RecommendationTo get the current status of this issue, I recommend:1. Checking the JIRA ticket **EUL-17639** for the latest updates2. Verifying in the merchant dashboard that the `YES_BIZ` authentication account is now properly configured for MID `hyperupi`3. Testing the `/upi/inapp` endpoint again to confirm resolutionThe fix would involve properly configuring the `YES_BIZ` PSP authentication account for the `hyperupi` merchant in the sandbox environment."

    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the context I have, I can see that authentication changes were being tested directly on the sandbox environment rather than locally. Looking at the OAuth2 token expiry mitigation strategy document , there's a specific reason for this approach:The authentication changes were being tested directly on the sandbox environment instead of locally because **the integration required validation against the NPCI sandbox infrastructure**. Specifically, the document states that the changes \"will be deployed to the UAT environment for validation against the NPCI sandbox, using a JMeter script to simulate high-concurrency requests at the point of token expiry\" .This approach was necessary because:1. **External API Dependencies**: The OAuth2 token management fixes needed to be tested against the actual NPCI UPI switch endpoints, which are only accessible through their sandbox environment, not through local development setups.2. **Realistic Network Conditions**: The race condition issues being addressed were related to token expiry timing and concurrent requests, which required testing under realistic network latency and timing conditions that couldn't be replicated locally.3. **Integration Validation**: The fixes involved the `juspay-go-sdk/npci/auth` module interacting with NPCI's authentication infrastructure, requiring end-to-end validation in an environment that mirrors production connectivity .4. **Audit Requirements**: This was identified as \"a critical prerequisite for the upcoming NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit,\" requiring validation in an environment that would satisfy audit requirements for demonstrating \"robust session management and proactive risk mitigation\" .Local testing wouldn't have provided the necessary validation of the authentication flow against the actual NPCI infrastructure that the changes were designed to fix."

    "question": "How can we prevent transactions from failing because they are being synced with the payment gateway before they are initiated?",
    "answer": "The proposed solution is to implement a threshold-based check. This means the system will not sync a transaction for the first 'x' retries or 't' minutes if it has not been initiated. Syncing will only begin after that threshold is passed. This approach is intended to reduce early sync failures while also handling potential system issues like pod crashes. Additionally, it was suggested that if a sync results in the payment gateway reporting 'no order found', the system should not attempt to sync that transaction again.",
    "source_thread_id": "1716811305.791449",
    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the retrieved context, there are several strategies to prevent transactions from failing due to synchronization issues with payment gateways before initiation:## Implement Proactive Token Management**OAuth Token Refresh Strategy**: Implement a proactive token refresh mechanism that refreshes access tokens 90 seconds before expiry and stores them in a shared Redis key, eliminating local credential caching and preventing race conditions . Use a distributed lock with Redis `SETNX` command to ensure only one pod can refresh tokens at a time .**Centralized Authentication**: Store refreshed tokens in a shared Redis cluster (e.g., `npci:auth:token`) so all service instances read from this shared key instead of maintaining local caches .## Fix Routing and Configuration Issues**Correct Payment Routing**: Ensure routing rules properly classify transactions by updating configuration maps like `payment-router-rules.yaml` to include correct MCC ranges and prevent misrouting to wrong gateways . For example, include MCC range `5540-5542` for cross-border transactions in the appropriate gateway profile .**Schema Validation**: Implement automated schema validation in CI/CD pipelines to prevent malformed routing rules from reaching production .## Implement Robust Retry and Circuit Breaker Patterns**Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Deploy client-side adaptive rate limiters using token bucket algorithms with distributed state management in Redis to smooth out request bursts and prevent throttling . Configure circuit breakers to trip after encountering consecutive 429 responses within sliding windows .**Exponential Backoff**: Replace fixed-interval retry logic with exponential backoff strategies incorporating jitter to de-synchronize retry attempts and distribute load more effectively .## Address Settlement and Reconciliation Issues**Transaction State Management**: Introduce intermediate states like `PENDING_RECONCILIATION` for transactions that need verification before finalization . Implement atomic updates to both primary transaction tables and reconciliation logs to guarantee data consistency .**Real-time Status Verification**: For transactions receiving timeout responses (like `U30` codes), implement forced status checks using APIs like NPCI's `getTxnStatus` to verify final transaction states .## Monitor and Alert**Enhanced Monitoring**: Create dedicated Grafana dashboards to monitor circuit breaker states, token refresh success rates, and queue depths for deferred processing . Set up alerts for when error rates exceed acceptable thresholds (e.g., >3% over 60-second windows) .These strategies address the root causes of synchronization failures including token expiry race conditions, routing misconfigurations, rate limiting issues, and settlement discrepancies that can cause transactions to fail before proper initiation.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the available documentation, I can see several patterns related to transaction synchronization issues with payment gateways. Here are the key strategies to prevent transactions from failing due to synchronization problems:## Root Causes and Prevention Strategies### 1. Race Condition in Event ProcessingThe documentation reveals a critical issue where **callback consumers commit transaction states before initial states are fully processed** . This happens when:- The `upi_callback_consumer` service processes async success notifications from NPCI- It commits final 'SUCCESS' status before the initial transaction state is logged by upstream services- This breaks the event-sourcing pattern and creates inconsistent states**Prevention Strategy:**- Implement **atomic state transitions** in your event processing architecture- Ensure the callback consumer publishes a `txn_status_finalized` event to a dedicated Kafka topic- Create an idempotent consumer service that atomically updates both primary payments table and reconciliation logs ### 2. OAuth Token Race ConditionsAnother common synchronization issue occurs with **OAuth token refresh cycles** :- Multiple service pods independently detect expiring tokens- Concurrent refresh requests cause NPCI to invalidate all but one token- Other pods cache stale credentials, leading to subsequent API failures**Prevention Strategy:**- Implement **distributed locking using Redis** with `SETNX` commands- Centralize token refresh logic so only one pod can acquire the refresh lock- Store refreshed tokens in shared Redis keys that all instances read from- Set appropriate lock TTLs (15 seconds) to prevent deadlocks ### 3. Asynchronous Status VerificationFor transactions experiencing gateway timeouts, implement **delayed status confirmation** :- For transactions with 'T707 - Gateway Await Timeout' errors- Trigger asynchronous `ReqTxnConfirmation` API calls after a cooling-off period (60 minutes)- Add `final_status_source` field to track state origin ('RespPay' vs. 'TxnConfirmation')### 4. Pre-emptive State ManagementTo prevent sync issues in multi-currency transactions :- **Pre-fetch and cache critical data** (like FX rates) during transaction synchronization- Store alongside transaction payload in Redis cache- Avoid post-facto lookups during settlement windows that can cause state mismatches### 5. Circuit Breaker PatternsImplement **Resilience4j-based circuit breakers** to prevent cascading failures:- Configure to trip when error rates exceed thresholds (3% over 60-second windows)- Prioritize critical payment initializations over status checks- Use dedicated Kafka topics for deferred processing when circuits are open## Implementation Recommendations1. **Atomic Transactions**: Ensure all state changes are atomic across your payment processing pipeline2. **Distributed Coordination**: Use Redis-based locking for shared resources like tokens3. **Async Verification**: Implement delayed confirmation mechanisms for timeout scenarios4. **Pre-caching**: Cache critical data early in the transaction lifecycle5. **Monitoring**: Set up comprehensive monitoring for race conditions and sync failuresThese strategies address the core synchronization challenges identified in your payment gateway architecture and should significantly reduce transaction failures due to timing issues."

    "question": "Why are sync tasks scheduled without waiting for the transaction initiation call to be made first?",
    "answer": "Sync tasks are scheduled agnostically of the initiation call to handle potential system failures. This is a safeguard in case a pod crashes after the initiation call is made but before the database status has been reliably updated. In that scenario, the scheduled sync is necessary to reconcile the transaction's status.",
    "source_thread_id": "1716811305.791449",
    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the retrieved context, I can see multiple instances of OAuth token refresh failures and API timeout issues that suggest synchronization problems, but there isn't specific information about sync tasks being scheduled without waiting for transaction initiation calls.The context shows several related technical issues that might be connected to your question:**OAuth Token Refresh Timing Issues:**- Multiple reports of OAuth 2.0 token refresh failures occurring before transaction calls complete - Systems experiencing `invalid_grant` errors when refresh tokens are used prematurely - Token refresh attempts timing out after configured thresholds (1500ms-3000ms) **API Call Sequencing Problems:**- Services receiving `401 Unauthorized` responses followed by failed token refresh attempts - Cascading failures where authentication issues cause downstream API timeouts - Circuit breaker patterns being implemented to handle these sequencing issues **Settlement and Reconciliation Timing:**- Issues with settlement batch jobs running before transaction status is finalized - Reconciliation services experiencing timing mismatches between transaction completion and status updates However, the specific architectural details about why sync tasks are scheduled without waiting for transaction initiation calls aren't explicitly documented in the available context. This could be related to the OAuth token management issues or settlement timing problems mentioned above, but I'd need more specific technical documentation to provide a definitive answer about the sync task scheduling logic.",

However, I can provide insights from related scenarios:## Identified Synchronization IssuesFrom the documentation, there are several instances where timing and sequencing of tasks create problems:### 1. Race Conditions in Event ProcessingThe analysis of UPI Settlement Mismatch reveals a critical race condition where:- The `upi_callback_consumer` service commits final 'SUCCESS' status to the database **before** the initial `U30` transaction state has been fully processed- This circumvents the intended event-sourcing pattern because state changes aren't atomically reflected in reconciliation staging tables### 2. Async Processing Without Proper DependenciesIn the forex rate caching implementation , there's a similar pattern where:- The system performs offline transaction synchronization via `syncOfflineTxns` endpoint- FX rates are cached at sync time rather than waiting for the actual transaction initiation- This creates a timing mismatch where rates may be stale by the time transactions are actually processed### 3. Token Management Scheduling IssuesThe ICICI OAuth refresh problem shows another example where:- Background tasks are scheduled (token refresh every 15 minutes) without proper coordination with actual API call timing- This leads to authentication failures when the scheduled refresh doesn't align with actual usage patterns## Root Cause PatternThe underlying issue appears to be **lack of proper dependency management** in the task scheduling system. Tasks are being scheduled based on time intervals or external triggers rather than waiting for prerequisite operations to complete.Would you be able to provide more specific details about:1. Which particular sync tasks you're referring to?2. What type of transaction initiation calls should be happening first?3. Any specific error codes or system components involved?This would help me search for more targeted information about your specific use case."

Here's what's happening:1. **Missing Configuration in Sandbox**: The `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` configuration was not properly released/deployed in the sandbox environment [referenced in Slack message].2. **Scheduler Bypass Logic**: Because this configuration is missing in sandbox, the system is incorrectly skipping the scheduler process, even though the merchant (`tvsmotor`) should be processed through the normal refund scheduling flow.3. **ProcessTracker Issue**: The refund was added to ProcessTracker but is not being executed properly due to the configuration mismatch between what the code expects and what's actually deployed in sandbox.## Additional ContextThere's also a separate API flow issue with CCAvenue that's worth noting:- CCAvenue returns a \"Success\" response for refund initiation requests, but the actual refund status needs to be checked via the `getRefundDetails` API call- This creates a discrepancy where the system thinks the refund succeeded when it may still be pending## Immediate Solutions1. **Deploy Missing Config**: Ensure the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` configuration is properly deployed to the sandbox environment2. **Add Merchant to Config**: If instant refunds are desired, add `tvsmotor` to the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` list3. **Check ProcessTracker**: Debug why ProcessTracker isn't executing the scheduled refunds even when they're added to the queue4. **Verify Scheduler Service**: Ensure the refund scheduler service is running properly in sandbox and can process the `refund_sync_frequency_intervals` (currently set to 300 seconds/5 minutes)The JIRA ticket **EUL-18115** has been created to track this issue. This is indeed a blocker for the merchant's go-live, so immediate attention to the configuration deployment in sandbox is needed."

    "model_answer_non_agentic": "The `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` flag was actually tested for TVS Motor but it didn't resolve their issue . According to the analysis, even after enabling TVS Motor on this configuration, the problem persisted because of how CCAvenue handles refund responses .The core issue is that CCAvenue returns a Success Response at the API level for refund requests, but the actual status of the refund is only available when calling `getRefundDetails` . This means that even with instant execution enabled, the system was still showing success based on the initial API response rather than the true refund status .Due to this continuing issue, TVS Motor was actually removed from the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` configuration, but the system is still initiating refunds directly to CCAvenue and giving a SUCCESS response . The team identified that they need to modify the flow to call `getRefundDetails` after refund initiation to get the actual status of the refund .So simply enabling the flag isn't sufficient - the integration needs to be updated to properly handle CCAvenue's two-step response pattern where the real refund status comes from a separate API call.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the Slack conversations I found, I can now explain why simply enabling the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` flag for TVS Motor doesn't fix their refund issue:## The TVS Motor Refund Issue and Why the Flag Doesn't Fix ItThe problem with TVS Motor's refund flow via CCAvenue is **not just about timing or scheduling** - it's a fundamental issue with how CCAvenue's API behaves:### The Core Issue:1. **CCAvenue's misleading API response**: When a refund request is made to CCAvenue, they return a \"Success\" response immediately, but this is just an API acknowledgment, not the actual refund status.2. **Actual refund status is asynchronous**: The real refund status is only available through a separate `getRefundDetails` API call, which needs to be made after the initial refund request.### Why the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` Flag Doesn't Help:Even when TVS Motor was added to the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` flag (which bypasses the scheduler and processes refunds immediately), **the issue persisted** because:- The flag only changes **when** the refund is processed, not **how** the refund status is determined- CCAvenue still returns the same misleading \"Success\" response regardless of timing- The system still needs to make the additional `getRefundDetails` call to get the actual refund status### What Actually Needs to Be Fixed:The solution requires **modifying the refund flow** to:1. Make the initial refund request to CCAvenue2. **Immediately follow up** with a `getRefundDetails` call to get the actual refund status3. Use the status from `getRefundDetails` (not the initial API response) to determine if the refund was successful### Current Status:- TVS Motor has been **removed** from the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` configuration- The system is currently giving a \"SUCCESS\" response based on CCAvenue's misleading initial response- This creates a poor user experience because users think the refund succeeded when it may have actually failedThe fix requires a code change to the refund processing logic, not just a configuration flag change."

For example, document describes how weak cipher suites like `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA` can cause handshake failures and recommends using modern cipher suites like `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`.## Recommended Resolution1. **Check TLS Configuration**: Verify that both the client (Juspay) and SIMPL's API endpoint are using compatible TLS versions and cipher suites.2. **Header Normalization**: Ensure that the request headers being sent to SIMPL match the successful pattern - remove or adjust the additional headers (`Content-Type`, `x-art-recording`, `Accept`) that appear in failed requests.3. **SSL/TLS Debugging**: Enable detailed SSL debugging to identify the exact point of handshake failure.4. **Cipher Suite Alignment**: Work with SIMPL's technical team to ensure cipher suite compatibility, similar to the ICICI Bank coordination mentioned in document .The issue is currently being tracked and has been escalated to @Mariyam and @Richa for resolution ."

    "question": "The merchant TimesPrime is facing issues with their LOYLTY Rewards integration in the sandbox environment. For one test card (4242...8007), the redeem option isn't appearing due to a 'Missing Mandatory Params PROGRAM_CODE' error. For another card (4357...4343), the redeem option appears but points are not deducted. What were the root causes and resolutions for these problems?",
    "answer": "The issues were diagnosed and addressed as follows:\n\n1.  **Card ending in 8007 (Missing Redeem Option):** The initial 'Missing Mandatory Params PROGRAM_CODE' error occurred because the corresponding `program_code` was not present in the sandbox database. The Loylty team provided the code ('YES DC'), which was then added. This led to a subsequent issue where the system incorrectly validated the 6-digit BIN as a US card. A fix for this was pushed to CUG. However, the latest error reported from the Loylty gateway for this card is 'Member Profile Not Found'.\n\n2.  **Card ending in 4343 (Points Not Deducted):** The failure to deduct points was caused by the Loylty 'fetch Balance' API timing out. The Loylty team suggested this might have been due to infrastructure changes on their end and asked to retry. A separate 'Invalid Client Auth Token' error was also encountered on the payment page; this was attributed to testing via Postman without passing a `customerId` in the `/cards/balance` API call.",

When checking the `/cards/balance` call, it returned the error \"Missing Mandatory Params PROGRAM_CODE\" because no outgoing call was being made to the LOYLTY Gateway . The Bin Info API showed `\"reward_supported\": false` and `\"reward_support_gateways\": []` for this card .**Technical Details:** The system wasn't recognizing this test card as eligible for LOYLTY rewards, so the \"Use Reward points to pay Redeem now\" option wasn't appearing on the payment page .## Problem 2: Test Card 4357083333374343 - Points Not Deducting**Root Cause:** There were two issues identified :1. **Missing Program Code:** For the corresponding program code `5278GHBM3806JJUW2267`, the program_code was not present in the sandbox database, causing the \"Missing Mandatory Params PROGRAM_CODE\" error .2. **API Performance Issues:** The fetch balance API was experiencing response timeouts due to high latency from the payment gateway side, with response times exceeding 10 seconds on first calls and around 5 seconds on subsequent calls .## Additional Context**Authentication Issues:** While the redeem option appeared for the second card when tested via Postman (returning successful balance response), the payment page showed authorization errors with `\"error_code\":\"access_denied\"` and `\"developer_message\":\"Invalid Client Auth Token or signature\"` . However, other API calls like SavedPaymentMethods were working fine with the same client_auth_token, indicating a specific issue with the balance API authentication .**Resolution Status:** The team was working on fixes for the missing program codes in the sandbox database and investigating the API timeout and authentication issues .",

    "question": "Why would I be getting an 'Invalid Client Auth Token or signature' error when calling the /cards/balance API, even if other API calls are working with the same token?",
    "answer": "Based on the discussion, this error occurs because the `/cards/balance` API call is being made without required linking data, such as a `customerId`, associated with the client auth token. This situation is particularly common when testing via an API client like Postman, where the token is sent without the context of a customer or order ID.",

    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the context, you're getting an 'Invalid Client Auth Token or signature' error on the `/cards/balance` API because **you're not passing linking data like customerId along with the client auth token** .According to the Slack discussion, this error occurs specifically \"because against the client auth token, we're not passing any linking data like customerId\" . The solution is to **pass customer id and check again** .Additionally, another team member confirmed that this response \"will come only in case of invalid auth\" , and there's mention that for signature-based merchants, \"you are getting this error because you are testing via postman and loading PP in which case clientauthtoken is being sent without either of customer id/order id/wallet id\" .So while your token might be valid for other APIs, the `/cards/balance` endpoint specifically requires additional linking data (customerId, orderId, or walletId) to be passed along with the client auth token to properly authenticate and authorize the request.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the available context and the authentication issues documented in your systems , here are the most likely causes for the \"Invalid Client Auth Token or signature\" error specifically on the `/cards/balance` API while other APIs work:## Potential Root Causes:### 1. **Endpoint-Specific Token Scopes or Permissions**The `/cards/balance` API may require different OAuth scopes or permissions compared to other APIs. Even with a valid token, it might lack the specific authorization scope needed for card balance queries.### 2. **API-Specific Signature Requirements**Based on the OAuth issues documented in your system , some endpoints may have different signature validation requirements:- The `/cards/balance` endpoint might require additional headers or a different signature algorithm- It could be validating the token signature against a different certificate or key### 3. **Token Expiry Race Conditions**Similar to the issues documented with ICICI integrations , there may be a race condition where:- Your token is near expiry and other APIs are more tolerant of slightly expired tokens- The `/cards/balance` API has stricter token validation timing### 4. **Caching Issues**From the token management problems described , consider:- Stale tokens cached specifically for card-related operations- Redis cache inconsistencies where the cached token for cards APIs is different from other services## Immediate Troubleshooting Steps:1. **Check Token Scopes**: Verify your OAuth token includes the necessary scopes for card balance operations2. **Force Token Refresh**: Clear any cached tokens and request a fresh one specifically for the cards API3. **Review Headers**: Ensure all required headers (Content-Type, Authorization, any custom headers) are identical to working API calls4. **Check Token Timing**: Verify the token hasn't expired and has sufficient time remaining5. **Validate Signature Method**: Confirm the signature algorithm and any client certificates are correctly configured for the cards serviceWould you be able to share the specific error response details or check your token scopes to help narrow down the exact cause?"

    "answer": "The mandate failed to retry due to a sequence of issues. Initially, the transaction did not process correctly because the merchant needed to be added to the `schedule_level_mandate_execution_enabled_merchants` configuration in the sandbox environment. After this was fixed, a subsequent retry attempt failed because the GSM check returned an error: \"User doesn't have sufficient balance in the account | Retarget_payment is not enabled by the merchant.\" A final attempt failed because the grace period for retrying had expired, as the grace period starts from the time of the initial transaction execution.",

Here's what's happening:### Primary Issue: Missing Gateway Status Mapping1. **Configuration Gap**: Your mandate execution is likely going through the HYPER_PG gateway, but there's a missing Gateway Status Mapping (GSM) entry for handling 'pending' notification responses .2. **System Behavior**: When the gateway responds with a 'pending' status, Juspay's system cannot interpret this response due to the missing GSM configuration, causing the workflow to become stuck waiting for a system-level state transition .3. **No Retry Trigger**: Since the system doesn't recognize the 'pending' response, it doesn't trigger the retry mechanism, even though you've enabled retries on the dashboard .### Technical Details- The notification framework uses an explicit NotificationStatus state machine in Juspay's codebase (Euler) - The GatewayStatusMap mapping logic determines how external gateway responses are converted to system states - Without a matching GSM entry for the 'pending' response, the transition never completes, causing indefinite stalling ### Secondary Issues (from related cases)From similar recent cases, there are also broader issues with mandate execution:1. **HYPER_PG Gateway Support Gap**: The notification logic (`syncNotificationForMandateV2`) only implements support for RBL_BIZ gateway, with HYPER_PG defaulting to a `GATEWAY_NOT_SUPPORTED` path 2. **Missing PDN Implementation**: For HYPER_PG, there's no Pre-Debit Notification (PDN) pipeline, which is required for mandate execution ## Immediate Actions Required### For Your Specific Case:1. **GSM Configuration Fix**: The engineering team needs to insert a GSM entry for HYPER_PG 'pending' state mapped to JuspayStatus 'Pending' for mandate flows 2. **Manual Intervention**: This requires internal Juspay configuration changes - no merchant action can resolve this### Broader System Fixes Needed:1. Implement notification creation and tracking logic for HYPER_PG within `syncNotificationForMandateV2` 2. Add configuration flag `HYPER_PG_MANDATE_NOTIFICATION_ENABLED` for affected merchants 3. Create HYPER_PG-specific notification retry and timeout policies ## EscalationThis is a **critical production-blocking issue** affecting all HYPER_PG UPI mandates. Similar cases show 0% success rates for mandate executions using this gateway configuration . The issue requires immediate attention from the engineering team to resolve the GSM configuration gap.You should escalate this to the technical team with reference to the specific order ID (203745493720) and merchant ID (sangam) to get the missing GSM configuration added."

    "question": "How is the grace period for mandate retries calculated? Does it start from the time of the retry failure?",
    "answer": "The grace period for a mandate retry starts from the time of the initial transaction execution, not from the time of the retry failure. If the execution is delayed, a retry may not be possible if it falls outside this grace period.",
    "source_thread_id": "1737616675.104799",

Retry feature not supported.\" This indicates that the system checks whether the current date has exceeded the grace period calculated from the retry failure date, and if so, it blocks further retry attempts.This grace period calculation appears to be part of the mandate retry logic that determines whether retry functionality is still available for a given mandate based on how much time has passed since the initial retry failure occurred.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the available context fragments, I can provide information about grace periods and retry mechanisms, though the specific calculation details for mandate retry grace periods are limited in the current documents.From the context, here's what I can tell you about grace periods and retries:## Grace Period ConfigurationThe system uses a `grace_period_ms` configuration parameter. In one case mentioned, there's a **35,000ms (35 second) grace period** configured in the reconciliation service . However, this appears to be insufficient for catching certain edge cases before marking transactions as settled.## Retry Mechanisms and TimingThe documents show several retry strategies being implemented:1. **Exponential Backoff with Jitter**: For handling HTTP 429 responses, the system implements exponential backoff strategies with initial intervals like 500ms and multipliers of 1.5 .2. **Fixed Interval Retries**: Some services use fixed-interval retry policies (e.g., 3 attempts at 500ms intervals) , though this approach is being replaced due to creating \"thundering herd\" effects.3. **Delayed Status Checks**: For certain transaction types, the system triggers delayed confirmation API calls after a 60-minute cooling-off period .## Mandate-Specific ContextFor mandate operations, there are references to:- Mandate creation API rate limiting issues - OAuth2 token refresh failures affecting mandate reporting - Retry strategies specifically for mandate-related failuresHowever, the specific calculation of when the grace period starts for mandate retries (whether from initial failure or retry failure) is not explicitly detailed in the available documents.**To get the exact calculation details you're looking for**, you may need to:1.

This has been reported for merchant ID `adityabirla_sunlife` in the production environment.## Root Cause AnalysisBased on the Slack discussion in the one-team channel , this appears to be a **data inconsistency issue** where:1. **Summary Count Logic**: The summary count (showing 15) is using one query/filter criteria for counting orders with \"Unknown\" payment gateway2. **Detailed List Logic**: The detailed list view is using different query parameters or filters, resulting in more records being displayed3. **Mixed Order Status**: The investigation shows that orders with various statuses (success, authorization failed, etc.) are appearing under the same \"Unknown\" gateway category ## Technical Investigation FindingsThe issue shows that:- Orders are being incorrectly categorized or filtered when displaying the summary count vs. the detailed list- There may be a **query parameter mismatch** between the summary aggregation and the list view API calls- Different payment gateway classifications are getting grouped together inappropriately## Similar Known IssuesThis appears related to other gateway classification problems in the system, such as:- **Settlement discrepancies** where transactions are processed through one gateway but show up under another - **Silent retry scenarios** where failed transactions on one gateway get retried on another, but the dashboard continues to show the original gateway [mentioned in related discussions]## Immediate Actions NeededThe engineering team should:1. **Compare API endpoints**: Check the exact curl/API calls being made for the summary count vs. the detailed list view2. **Query parameter analysis**: Verify that both views are using identical filter criteria for \"Unknown\" payment gateway3. **Database consistency check**: Ensure the payment gateway field is correctly populated and consistently referenced across both queriesThis is a critical dashboard accuracy issue that affects merchant trust and should be prioritized for immediate investigation and resolution."

    "question": "What is the logic of the 'sample modal' for orders, and why does it show a different number of records than the summary count?",
    "answer": "The 'sample modal' does not show a real-time count but rather a sample of up to 100 orders. The discrepancy with the summary count occurs because the modal incorrectly combines both 'orders_with_transaction' and 'new orders' (orders without a transaction), whereas the summary count only includes 'orders_with_transaction'.",
    "source_thread_id": "1718277739.045289",
    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the Slack conversation, the 'sample modal' logic works as follows:The sample modal doesn't show the real count - it just displays a sample of 100 orders if there are more than 100 orders . This sample includes both:- New orders (without transactions)- Orders which have transactions The discrepancy occurs because:1. **Sample Modal Count**: Shows orders_with_transaction + new orders (up to 100 as a sample) 2. **Summary Table Count**: Shows metrics only for orders with transactions and doesn't include new orders So if you see 15 orders in the UI, those are specifically the orders for which transactions have been created . The sample modal shows a broader set that includes both transaction orders and new orders, while the summary table is filtered to only show orders that have associated transactions .This explains why there's a difference between the number of orders_with_transaction shown versus the number of sample orders displayed in the sample modal .",

The `upi-common-library` has a race condition during NPCI OAuth token refresh cycles, where multiple Kubernetes pods independently detect expiring tokens and initiate refresh requests concurrently . This causes NPCI's token endpoint to invalidate all but one of the new tokens, leaving other pods with stale credentials.**Mitigation Strategy**: The proposed solution involves implementing a distributed lock using Redis with `SETNX` commands to ensure only a single pod can refresh tokens. The winning pod will refresh tokens 90 seconds before expiry and update shared Redis keys for other instances to use .## Configuration Management Problems**Cross-Border Routing Misconfiguration**: The HyperSwitch routing engine experienced a critical misconfiguration in the `bin_routing_rules.yaml` file, where static rules failed to exclude new Singaporean BIN ranges, causing incorrect routing of international transactions . This resulted in approximately 850 transactions being incorrectly processed through domestic endpoints.**Remediation**: A hotfix deployment of updated `bin_routing_rules.v1.6.yaml` with more specific regex patterns was implemented, along with plans to integrate an external BIN database API to replace static rule files with dynamic lookups .## Service-Specific Deployment Issues**KYC Processing Timeouts**: The `kyc-processor` service is experiencing cascading failures when handling high-risk customer segments, with critical Kafka consumer lag exceeding 10,000 messages due to insufficient HTTP client timeout configurations (3000ms) for ICICI Bank's CKYC API .**Rate Limiting Problems**: Services are facing persistent HTTP 429 responses from external APIs, requiring implementation of adaptive rate limiters using token bucket algorithms and exponential backoff strategies .## Infrastructure Configuration Issues**Redis Cache Contention**: The Sentinel risk-scoring engine experienced P99 latency spikes from ~80ms to >350ms due to Redis cache misses caused by incorrect `allkeys-lru` eviction policy configuration . The solution involves switching to `volatile-lfu` eviction policy and implementing tiered caching strategies.**PCI Compliance Violations**: Multiple services have configuration issues leading to PCI DSS violations, including unmasked PAN data in Kafka topics and weak TLS cipher suites in Nginx Ingress Controllers .These issues highlight the need for better centralized configuration management, improved deployment validation processes, and more robust service mesh configurations to handle authentication and rate limiting challenges.",

Currently, when a 5xx response is received from the Pinelabs gateway with a generic error message like \"An error has occurred,\" the refund status is being updated as **failure** at Juspay's end . However, this is problematic because in many cases, the first refund was actually processed successfully at the gateway level .This handling has led to several concerning scenarios:## Specific Issues Identified:1. **False Failure Status**: Refunds are being marked as failed when they were actually successful at the gateway 2. **Duplicate Refunds**: When merchants retry refunds believing the initial attempt failed, all subsequent attempts fail since the full amount had already been refunded 3. **Partial Refund Risk**: For partial refunds, merchants could unintentionally initiate duplicate refunds due to this incorrect failure handling ## Current Impact:For example, with merchant `pharmeasytech`, there were cases where:- **Order ID: 0027820382**: 8 refund attempts were made, with 7 showing as failed on Juspay dashboard and 1 successful, but Pinelabs confirmed all 8 attempts were actually successful - **Order ID: 0027824429**: 4 attempts were made with 3 showing as failed, but all were confirmed successful by Pinelabs ## Recommended Solution:The current procedure should be updated so that **refunds with 5xx response codes in refund syncs are kept in 'pending' status instead of being marked as 'failure'** .

    "answer": "The plan is to identify all gateway response fields that are marked as mandatory but are not actually used in the code, and then refactor them to be optional (`Maybe`). Sandeep Reddy is leading this effort and has already extracted the unused field data from `api-txns` and `api-gateway`. He is now writing the logic to filter this data. The technical approach involves a 'code-as-data' traversal to find usage patterns. However, there is a noted risk that making a field optional could alter the `fromJSON` decoding sequence, potentially breaking deserialization for certain data types.",

    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the discussion in the team channel, there is a plan to address the recurring decode errors caused by unused mandatory fields in gateway responses . The proposed solution involves:**Identification Phase:**- Use code-as-data analysis and LLM technology to identify all gateway response type fields that are marked as mandatory but are not referenced anywhere in the codebase - Focus on fields that are required by gateways but not actually used by the application logic **Remediation Approach:**- Mark the identified unused mandatory fields as \"Maybe\" (optional) instead of mandatory - This would prevent decode errors when gateways update their responses or when certain fields are marked mandatory unnecessarily **Technical Implementation:**- Leverage automated code analysis tools combined with LLM capabilities to systematically review the codebase - The team members @sandeep reddy, @Divyanshu Varshney, @ag, and @Eswar are involved in this effort The root cause of these decode errors is that gateways sometimes update their responses or mark certain fields as mandatory when they shouldn't be, causing the application's decode logic to fail when these unused fields are missing or have unexpected values .",

    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the retrieved context, I can see several code patterns and field usage detection scenarios across different systems:## Database Field Usage Patterns**Connection Pool Monitoring**: The Sentinel Risk Engine experienced latency spikes due to ScyllaDB connection pool exhaustion, where the `scylla_connection_wait_time_ms` metric was used to detect thread contention . The `scylla.db.connection.pool.max_size` parameter was monitored and adjusted from 250 to 400 connections .**Query Pattern Detection**: Inefficient query patterns were identified in the risk scoring engine, where multiple sequential database lookups were detected instead of batched operations . The system monitors `ReadIOPS` saturation on Aurora PostgreSQL read replicas .## API Field Validation Patterns**Missing Field Detection**: Several instances show systems detecting missing or null fields:- The `beneficiary_country` field being populated as null in cross-border payment payloads - Missing `device_fingerprint` and `user_risk_score` fields causing HTTP 422 errors - The `enhanced_monitoring_flag` and `transaction_risk_score` fields causing routing parameter errors **Field Format Validation**: PAN masking patterns are implemented using `6x 4x` format (e.g., `454545XXXXXX4545`) , with regex patterns for cardholder data detection before tokenization .## Configuration Drift Detection**Parameter Monitoring**: The Flink job configuration drift was detected through the `slidingWindow.interval` parameter change . Circuit breaker patterns using Resilience4j are implemented to detect API rate limiting with error code `J_EXT_THROTTLED` .## Fraud Model Field Analysis**Feature Vector Analysis**: The fraud detection models monitor specific field patterns:- `device_freshness_score` over-weighting detection - `device_first_seen` field sensitivity for LITE X accounts - Transaction velocity and history field cross-referencing across `transaction_history`, `device_fingerprints`, and `merchant_velocity` tables ## Error Code Pattern DetectionSystems track various error codes and field-related failures:- `FRD_801` (Anomalous Velocity) for false positives - `FLAG_REASON_CODE: 701` for velocity check mismatches - `GW-RL-003` for API quota exceeded scenarios These patterns suggest comprehensive field usage monitoring across payment processing, fraud detection, and compliance systems.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the available context from your technical documents, I can see several specific code patterns that are being used to determine if fields are actually being used:## Field Detection Patterns**1. Regex Pattern Matching for Sensitive Data**From the PCI DSS remediation documents , your team implements:- **Predefined regex patterns** for cardholder data detection before log events are written- **Field matching patterns** that identify sensitive fields like `pan_last4` in production logs- **Custom data masking filters** that utilize regex to obfuscate fields matching specific patterns**2. JSON Payload Field Inspection**Several documents show patterns for detecting field usage in JSON structures:- **Field-specific matching** like `payment_details.card_number` field within JSON payloads - **Object-level detection** where entire `payment_details` objects are identified and processed- **Nested field patterns** for complex JSON structures in API responses**3. Database Field Usage Detection**From the technical implementations described:- **Schema field tracking** where new fields like `final_status_source` are added with clear audit trails - **Field correlation analysis** across multiple database tables (`transaction_history`, `device_fingerprints`, `merchant_velocity`) - **Cross-reference patterns** that identify which fields are actively queried in complex multi-join operations**4. Configuration-Based Detection**The documents show patterns for:- **Configuration drift detection** using tools like Conftest to validate field usage in Helm charts - **Parameter validation** patterns that check for field presence and usage in service configurations- **Feature flag patterns** that control which fields are actively processed**5. Log Analysis Patterns**- **String pattern monitoring** like alerts configured to detect specific field names (`pan_last4`) in logs - **Field redaction patterns** that identify sensitive fields (`deviceFingerprint`, `vpaHandle`) before Kafka publication - **Audit trail patterns** that track field access and modification across servicesThese patterns suggest your organization uses a combination of static analysis tools, runtime monitoring, and configuration validation to determine actual field usage across your payment processing infrastructure."

First, to fix early sync failures, a custom PT sync frequency was created for SBI (`PT_TXN_SYNC_FREQUENCY_MAPPINGS_SBI`) and set to 10 minutes. Second, to handle the redirection response correctly, mandatory sync was enabled for the SBI gateway by adding it to the `sync_enabled_gateway_for_redirection` and `authentication_failed_enabled_sync_gateways` configurations.",

To resolve this, they requested a customized PT (Payment Transaction) sync frequency specifically for SBI gateway, starting from 300 seconds (5 minutes) instead of the default 90 seconds .**Resolution for Sync Check on Redirection:**Regarding the mandatory sync check issue, it was confirmed that the SBI gateway wasn't enabled under the `sync_enabled_gateway_for_redirection` config . However, team member Pankhudi Jain clarified that most gateways don't rely on this config and automatically perform sync directly . The team needed to check the specific gateway implementation for SBI to confirm whether this configuration change would suffice or if the config wasn't being considered for the gateway implementation itself .The issues were tracked with order IDs ORD091224000145 and ORD091224000027 for merchant ID 'ccil' in the production environment, and the resolution was being coordinated through JIRA ticket EUL-14446 .",

Here's what was identified and resolved:## Resolution for SBI Gateway Sync IssuesThe SBI gateway sync issues involved two main problems and their corresponding resolutions:### **Issue 1: Missing Sync Check on Redirection****Problem**: The system wasn't performing a mandatory sync check with the SBI gateway upon receiving a redirection response. The gateway wasn't enabled under the config `sync_enabled_gateway_for_redirection`.**Resolution**: - Enabled the gateway under the `sync_enabled_gateway_for_redirection` configuration- Enabled the gateway for the config `authentication_failed_enabled_sync_gateways` to allow syncing for failed cases### **Issue 2: Early Sync Failures****Problem**: The system was performing PT (Payment Transaction) sync within 2 minutes of initiation. However, the SBI gateway tends to give a failure response if synced before the first 5 minutes of transaction creation on their end. The default `PT_TXN_SYNC_FREQUENCY_MAPPINGS` config had sync starting after 90 seconds, which was too early for SBI.**Resolution**: - Increased the PT sync frequency for SBI specifically to 10 minutes (600 seconds) instead of the default 90 seconds- This was later refined to start syncing after 5 minutes and 30 seconds (330 seconds) to ensure syncing happens after redirection response### **Additional Issues and Resolutions**The team also identified and resolved several related problems:1. **Invalid Reference Number Handling**: Added support in code for GSM (Gateway State Management) handling to keep transactions with \"Invalid Reference Number\" error messages as Pending for a threshold before moving to Authorization Failed2. **Order and Transaction Status Mismatch**: Fixed issues where transaction status was being overwritten from Failed to Pending due to incorrect handling of `v2/pay/response`3. **Force Sync Implementation**: Enabled mandatory sync so the system could consume status responses during `v2/pay/response`These changes were implemented to prevent failure-to-success cases and ensure proper transaction status synchronization between Juspay's system and the SBI gateway.The resolution was tracked under JIRA ticket EUL-14446 and involved immediate fixes to handle the urgency of the issue while identifying areas for longer-term code improvements."

This caused the CRED ↔ Swiggy success rate to drop to 0% starting from 3:45 PM on the day the issue was reported .**The Problem:**From the Slack alert, it appears that Juspay's system was rejecting successful order webhooks from CRED payment gateway when they were destined for Swiggy's merchant ID. The alert shows a sample successful transaction payload with:- Status: \"OK\" - State: \"COMPLETED\"- Amount: ₹168- Payment method: UPI- Tracking ID: \"com.swiggy-221930100000243-1\"However, despite CRED indicating these transactions were successful, Juspay's webhook processing system was rejecting them, causing the success rate to drop to zero .**Resolution:**While the search results don't show the exact technical resolution steps, the pattern from similar webhook issues in the system suggests the resolution likely involved:1. **Investigation of webhook validation logic** - The system was likely applying incorrect validation rules to CRED's webhook format for the specific Swiggy MID2. **Configuration fixes** - Adjustments to merchant-specific webhook processing rules3. **Merchant ID mapping corrections** - Ensuring proper routing of CRED webhooks to the correct Swiggy merchant configurationThe alert was escalated to the engineering team for immediate investigation and resolution, as indicated by the `<!subteam^S01HMM1KV53>` tag in the Slack message .Unfortunately, the search results don't contain the follow-up messages showing the exact technical root cause or the specific steps taken to resolve the issue.

    "answer": "Mandatory sync is necessary because the incoming webhook requests do not contain a checksum or any other type of hash for validation.",
    "source_thread_id": "1738856307.508469",
    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the retrieved context, mandatory sync is a requirement for webhooks due to several critical reasons:**Error Handling and Data Integrity:**Mandatory sync is essential because webhooks can fail or be rejected, and the sync process provides the actual error information needed for proper handling . When mandatory sync fails, the webhook is also rejected to maintain data consistency .**Reliable Transaction Status:**For successful transactions, webhooks may not always provide complete information. The sync process ensures that Payment Gateway Records (PGR) are created based on the actual transaction status rather than just webhook data, as auth codes are sometimes only available through sync for certain cases .**System Reliability:**Webhooks are not always reliable - they can be encrypted (making them difficult to process) , may not be consumed properly , or may fail entirely . Mandatory sync provides a fallback mechanism to ensure transaction data is properly captured and processed.**Compliance and Audit Requirements:**The sync process helps maintain complete audit trails and ensures that transaction states are accurately reflected in the system, which is crucial for regulatory compliance and settlement processes.The mandatory sync requirement essentially serves as a safety net to ensure data completeness and accuracy when webhook-based communication fails or provides incomplete information.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the documentation I found, mandatory sync is a requirement for webhooks primarily due to **regulatory compliance and audit requirements**. Here are the key reasons:## NPCI Data Localization MandateThe primary driver for mandatory sync in webhooks is **NPCI's data localization mandate for UPI International transactions** . Your organization must eliminate batch-based polling mechanisms that introduce settlement latency and potential data residency gaps.## Real-Time Settlement RequirementsThe current batch-based approach (cron job querying forex partner's API every 15 minutes) introduces **settlement latency of up to T+900 seconds** . This violates NPCI's requirements for:- **Instantaneous event data capture** within India-based infrastructure- **Real-time webhook-based systems** that ensure event data is captured immediately upon successful currency conversion ## Audit Trail and ComplianceMandatory sync ensures:- **Complete and immutable audit trails** for NPCI review through direct logging to append-only audit tables - **Data consistency guarantees** by providing robust, auditable records for every transaction state change, satisfying RBI requirements - **P99 latency targets** under 150ms for settlement acknowledgement ## Technical ImplementationThe sync requirement is implemented through:- **Decoupled confirmation events** from final database writes using dedicated Kafka topics- **Atomic updates** to both primary payments tables and reconciliation logs- **Failure monitoring** with specific timeout codes (like `FX_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT`) if callbacks aren't received within 30 seconds The mandatory sync requirement essentially ensures that your webhook implementations meet stringent regulatory standards for financial transaction processing while maintaining data sovereignty within Indian infrastructure."

Here's what's happening:## Root Cause AnalysisFor order **29912440** (merchant: icicipru, payment gateway: PAYU), the refund gateway sync shows a success status, but it remains marked as pending on your end due to a **case sensitivity issue** in the status response handling.## The IssueAccording to the Slack discussion found, the problem is that:1. **Normal successful cases**: PAYU typically returns the success status in **lowercase**2. **Your specific order**: PAYU returned the success status in **uppercase** 3. **System behavior**: Your refund processing system wasn't properly handling the uppercase success status, causing it to remain in \"pending\" state despite the gateway showing success## Similar Pattern IdentifiedThe search results also show a related pattern documented in the Slack messages where during refund initiation, if an error occurs from the payment gateway, the system marks the refund as \"Pending\" and continues syncing. However, due to error responses during initiation, the system doesn't receive the `epgTxnId` from the gateway, making it unable to update the corresponding entry in the refund table.## Technical ContextFrom the documentation found, this appears to be part of a broader issue with PAYU refund sync processes where:- Initial refund requests may encounter errors but still process successfully on PAYU's end- Case sensitivity in status responses isn't being handled uniformly- The sync process continues but fails to properly update internal records due to missing transaction mappings## Recommended ActionThis case sensitivity issue should be escalated to the engineering team to implement proper case-insensitive status checking in the PAYU refund sync process, ensuring that both uppercase and lowercase success statuses are properly recognized and processed."
