    "question": "What was the cause for the Success Rate (SR) drop for the merchant 'htott', as mentioned in ticket 639347?",
    "answer": "The overall Success Rate for 'htott' on EMANDATE_REGISTER dropped by 2.49% because the underlying payment gateways themselves experienced a reduced SR during the period of December 9th to 13th, compared to the previous week (December 2nd to 8th).",
    "source_thread_id": "1734061983.978469",
    "model_answer_non_agentic": "According to the Slack message about ticket 639347, the Success Rate (SR) drop for merchant 'htott' was caused by a reduction in the Success Rates of the underlying Payment Gateways (PGs) themselves . The drop occurred during the period of 9th-13th December compared to the previous week (2nd-8th December), which resulted in an overall SR drop of 2.49% at the EMANDATE_REGISTER level for the merchant .",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the search results, I found the answer to your question about ticket 639347 and the Success Rate drop for merchant 'htott'.According to the information found in the Slack messages from the one-team channel :**Cause of Success Rate (SR) drop for merchant 'htott' in ticket 639347:**The Success Rate drop for merchant 'htott' was caused by a reduction in the Success Rates of the underlying Payment Gateways (PGs) themselves during the period of December 9th-13th compared to the previous week (December 2nd-8th). This decline in the underlying PG performance resulted in an overall Success Rate drop of **2.49%** at the `EMANDATE_REGISTER` level for the merchant.In summary, the root cause was not an issue with the merchant's configuration or processes, but rather a degradation in the performance of the underlying payment gateway infrastructure that the merchant was using during that specific time period."

    "question": "What was the issue causing CRED and Swiggy webhook success rates to drop to zero, and how was it resolved?",
    "answer": "The issue was on CRED's end; they began blocking sync calls that contained a period ('.') in the URL. This caused our mandatory sync to fail, which in turn led to the rejection of the webhooks. The problem was resolved after CRED fixed the issue on their side. To reconcile the affected orders, a bulk sync was planned to move them to their correct final status.",

The message was an alert requesting investigation into the problem, but the resolution details are not provided in the available context.",

This caused the CRED ↔ Swiggy success rate to drop to 0% starting from 3:45 PM on the day the issue was reported .**The Problem:**From the Slack alert, it appears that Juspay's system was rejecting successful order webhooks from CRED payment gateway when they were destined for Swiggy's merchant ID. The alert shows a sample successful transaction payload with:- Status: \"OK\" - State: \"COMPLETED\"- Amount: ₹168- Payment method: UPI- Tracking ID: \"com.swiggy-221930100000243-1\"However, despite CRED indicating these transactions were successful, Juspay's webhook processing system was rejecting them, causing the success rate to drop to zero .**Resolution:**While the search results don't show the exact technical resolution steps, the pattern from similar webhook issues in the system suggests the resolution likely involved:1. **Investigation of webhook validation logic** - The system was likely applying incorrect validation rules to CRED's webhook format for the specific Swiggy MID2. **Configuration fixes** - Adjustments to merchant-specific webhook processing rules3. **Merchant ID mapping corrections** - Ensuring proper routing of CRED webhooks to the correct Swiggy merchant configurationThe alert was escalated to the engineering team for immediate investigation and resolution, as indicated by the `<!subteam^S01HMM1KV53>` tag in the Slack message .Unfortunately, the search results don't contain the follow-up messages showing the exact technical root cause or the specific steps taken to resolve the issue.

    "question": "Why is mandatory sync a requirement for our webhooks?",
    "answer": "Mandatory sync is necessary because the incoming webhook requests do not contain a checksum or any other type of hash for validation.",
    "source_thread_id": "1738856307.508469",
    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the retrieved context, mandatory sync is a requirement for webhooks due to several critical reasons:**Error Handling and Data Integrity:**Mandatory sync is essential because webhooks can fail or be rejected, and the sync process provides the actual error information needed for proper handling . When mandatory sync fails, the webhook is also rejected to maintain data consistency .**Reliable Transaction Status:**For successful transactions, webhooks may not always provide complete information. The sync process ensures that Payment Gateway Records (PGR) are created based on the actual transaction status rather than just webhook data, as auth codes are sometimes only available through sync for certain cases .**System Reliability:**Webhooks are not always reliable - they can be encrypted (making them difficult to process) , may not be consumed properly , or may fail entirely . Mandatory sync provides a fallback mechanism to ensure transaction data is properly captured and processed.**Compliance and Audit Requirements:**The sync process helps maintain complete audit trails and ensures that transaction states are accurately reflected in the system, which is crucial for regulatory compliance and settlement processes.The mandatory sync requirement essentially serves as a safety net to ensure data completeness and accuracy when webhook-based communication fails or provides incomplete information.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the documentation I found, mandatory sync is a requirement for webhooks primarily due to **regulatory compliance and audit requirements**. Here are the key reasons:## NPCI Data Localization MandateThe primary driver for mandatory sync in webhooks is **NPCI's data localization mandate for UPI International transactions** . Your organization must eliminate batch-based polling mechanisms that introduce settlement latency and potential data residency gaps.## Real-Time Settlement RequirementsThe current batch-based approach (cron job querying forex partner's API every 15 minutes) introduces **settlement latency of up to T+900 seconds** . This violates NPCI's requirements for:- **Instantaneous event data capture** within India-based infrastructure- **Real-time webhook-based systems** that ensure event data is captured immediately upon successful currency conversion ## Audit Trail and ComplianceMandatory sync ensures:- **Complete and immutable audit trails** for NPCI review through direct logging to append-only audit tables - **Data consistency guarantees** by providing robust, auditable records for every transaction state change, satisfying RBI requirements - **P99 latency targets** under 150ms for settlement acknowledgement ## Technical ImplementationThe sync requirement is implemented through:- **Decoupled confirmation events** from final database writes using dedicated Kafka topics- **Atomic updates** to both primary payments tables and reconciliation logs- **Failure monitoring** with specific timeout codes (like `FX_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT`) if callbacks aren't received within 30 seconds The mandatory sync requirement essentially ensures that your webhook implementations meet stringent regulatory standards for financial transaction processing while maintaining data sovereignty within Indian infrastructure."

Here's what's happening:## Root Cause AnalysisFor order **29912440** (merchant: icicipru, payment gateway: PAYU), the refund gateway sync shows a success status, but it remains marked as pending on your end due to a **case sensitivity issue** in the status response handling.## The IssueAccording to the Slack discussion found, the problem is that:1. **Normal successful cases**: PAYU typically returns the success status in **lowercase**2. **Your specific order**: PAYU returned the success status in **uppercase** 3. **System behavior**: Your refund processing system wasn't properly handling the uppercase success status, causing it to remain in \"pending\" state despite the gateway showing success## Similar Pattern IdentifiedThe search results also show a related pattern documented in the Slack messages where during refund initiation, if an error occurs from the payment gateway, the system marks the refund as \"Pending\" and continues syncing. However, due to error responses during initiation, the system doesn't receive the `epgTxnId` from the gateway, making it unable to update the corresponding entry in the refund table.## Technical ContextFrom the documentation found, this appears to be part of a broader issue with PAYU refund sync processes where:- Initial refund requests may encounter errors but still process successfully on PAYU's end- Case sensitivity in status responses isn't being handled uniformly- The sync process continues but fails to properly update internal records due to missing transaction mappings## Recommended ActionThis case sensitivity issue should be escalated to the engineering team to implement proper case-insensitive status checking in the PAYU refund sync process, ensuring that both uppercase and lowercase success statuses are properly recognized and processed."
