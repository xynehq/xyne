The problem occurs because:1. **Missing Authentication Account Configuration**: The merchant `hyperupi` (which appears to be related to `swiggy-nf`) does not have the `YES_BIZ` authentication account properly set up in the system.2. **PSP Mismatch**: When making `/upi/inapp` session params calls, the system is checking for an authentication account for the PSP `YES_BIZ`, but this authentication account is not configured for the merchant in question.3. **Configuration Gap**: Although the dashboard showed that an auth account was configured, there was a gap specifically for the `YES_BIZ` PSP authentication account setup.## Resolution StatusFrom the Slack conversations found, the issue was escalated to the appropriate teams with the following actions:- The issue was raised to be addressed with the merchant (Swiggy) team- The team identified that a `YES_BIZ` authentication account needed to be set up for the merchant- This was escalated to @Surya and @Utkarsh Gupta for merchant configurationHowever, I don't see a definitive confirmation in the current search results that this specific issue has been fully resolved. ## RecommendationTo get the current status of this issue, I recommend:1.

    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the context I have, I can see that authentication changes were being tested directly on the sandbox environment rather than locally. Looking at the OAuth2 token expiry mitigation strategy document , there's a specific reason for this approach:The authentication changes were being tested directly on the sandbox environment instead of locally because **the integration required validation against the NPCI sandbox infrastructure**. Specifically, the document states that the changes \"will be deployed to the UAT environment for validation against the NPCI sandbox, using a JMeter script to simulate high-concurrency requests at the point of token expiry\" .This approach was necessary because:1. **External API Dependencies**: The OAuth2 token management fixes needed to be tested against the actual NPCI UPI switch endpoints, which are only accessible through their sandbox environment, not through local development setups.2. **Realistic Network Conditions**: The race condition issues being addressed were related to token expiry timing and concurrent requests, which required testing under realistic network latency and timing conditions that couldn't be replicated locally.3. **Integration Validation**: The fixes involved the `juspay-go-sdk/npci/auth` module interacting with NPCI's authentication infrastructure, requiring end-to-end validation in an environment that mirrors production connectivity .4. **Audit Requirements**: This was identified as \"a critical prerequisite for the upcoming NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit,\" requiring validation in an environment that would satisfy audit requirements for demonstrating \"robust session management and proactive risk mitigation\" .Local testing wouldn't have provided the necessary validation of the authentication flow against the actual NPCI infrastructure that the changes were designed to fix.",

    "question": "How can we prevent transactions from failing because they are being synced with the payment gateway before they are initiated?",
    "answer": "The proposed solution is to implement a threshold-based check. This means the system will not sync a transaction for the first 'x' retries or 't' minutes if it has not been initiated. Syncing will only begin after that threshold is passed. This approach is intended to reduce early sync failures while also handling potential system issues like pod crashes. Additionally, it was suggested that if a sync results in the payment gateway reporting 'no order found', the system should not attempt to sync that transaction again.",
    "source_thread_id": "1716811305.791449",
    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the retrieved context, there are several strategies to prevent transactions from failing due to synchronization issues with payment gateways before initiation:## Implement Proactive Token Management**OAuth Token Refresh Strategy**: Implement a proactive token refresh mechanism that refreshes access tokens 90 seconds before expiry and stores them in a shared Redis key, eliminating local credential caching and preventing race conditions . Use a distributed lock with Redis `SETNX` command to ensure only one pod can refresh tokens at a time .**Centralized Authentication**: Store refreshed tokens in a shared Redis cluster (e.g., `npci:auth:token`) so all service instances read from this shared key instead of maintaining local caches .## Fix Routing and Configuration Issues**Correct Payment Routing**: Ensure routing rules properly classify transactions by updating configuration maps like `payment-router-rules.yaml` to include correct MCC ranges and prevent misrouting to wrong gateways . For example, include MCC range `5540-5542` for cross-border transactions in the appropriate gateway profile .**Schema Validation**: Implement automated schema validation in CI/CD pipelines to prevent malformed routing rules from reaching production .## Implement Robust Retry and Circuit Breaker Patterns**Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Deploy client-side adaptive rate limiters using token bucket algorithms with distributed state management in Redis to smooth out request bursts and prevent throttling . Configure circuit breakers to trip after encountering consecutive 429 responses within sliding windows .**Exponential Backoff**: Replace fixed-interval retry logic with exponential backoff strategies incorporating jitter to de-synchronize retry attempts and distribute load more effectively .## Address Settlement and Reconciliation Issues**Transaction State Management**: Introduce intermediate states like `PENDING_RECONCILIATION` for transactions that need verification before finalization . Implement atomic updates to both primary transaction tables and reconciliation logs to guarantee data consistency .**Real-time Status Verification**: For transactions receiving timeout responses (like `U30` codes), implement forced status checks using APIs like NPCI's `getTxnStatus` to verify final transaction states .## Monitor and Alert**Enhanced Monitoring**: Create dedicated Grafana dashboards to monitor circuit breaker states, token refresh success rates, and queue depths for deferred processing . Set up alerts for when error rates exceed acceptable thresholds (e.g., >3% over 60-second windows) .These strategies address the root causes of synchronization failures including token expiry race conditions, routing misconfigurations, rate limiting issues, and settlement discrepancies that can cause transactions to fail before proper initiation.",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the available documentation, I can see several patterns related to transaction synchronization issues with payment gateways. Here are the key strategies to prevent transactions from failing due to synchronization problems:## Root Causes and Prevention Strategies### 1. Race Condition in Event ProcessingThe documentation reveals a critical issue where **callback consumers commit transaction states before initial states are fully processed** . This happens when:- The `upi_callback_consumer` service processes async success notifications from NPCI- It commits final 'SUCCESS' status before the initial transaction state is logged by upstream services- This breaks the event-sourcing pattern and creates inconsistent states**Prevention Strategy:**- Implement **atomic state transitions** in your event processing architecture- Ensure the callback consumer publishes a `txn_status_finalized` event to a dedicated Kafka topic- Create an idempotent consumer service that atomically updates both primary payments table and reconciliation logs ### 2. OAuth Token Race ConditionsAnother common synchronization issue occurs with **OAuth token refresh cycles** :- Multiple service pods independently detect expiring tokens- Concurrent refresh requests cause NPCI to invalidate all but one token- Other pods cache stale credentials, leading to subsequent API failures**Prevention Strategy:**- Implement **distributed locking using Redis** with `SETNX` commands- Centralize token refresh logic so only one pod can acquire the refresh lock- Store refreshed tokens in shared Redis keys that all instances read from- Set appropriate lock TTLs (15 seconds) to prevent deadlocks ### 3. Asynchronous Status VerificationFor transactions experiencing gateway timeouts, implement **delayed status confirmation** :- For transactions with 'T707 - Gateway Await Timeout' errors- Trigger asynchronous `ReqTxnConfirmation` API calls after a cooling-off period (60 minutes)- Add `final_status_source` field to track state origin ('RespPay' vs. 'TxnConfirmation')### 4. Pre-emptive State ManagementTo prevent sync issues in multi-currency transactions :- **Pre-fetch and cache critical data** (like FX rates) during transaction synchronization- Store alongside transaction payload in Redis cache- Avoid post-facto lookups during settlement windows that can cause state mismatches### 5. Circuit Breaker PatternsImplement **Resilience4j-based circuit breakers** to prevent cascading failures:- Configure to trip when error rates exceed thresholds (3% over 60-second windows)- Prioritize critical payment initializations over status checks- Use dedicated Kafka topics for deferred processing when circuits are open## Implementation Recommendations1. **Atomic Transactions**: Ensure all state changes are atomic across your payment processing pipeline2. **Distributed Coordination**: Use Redis-based locking for shared resources like tokens3. **Async Verification**: Implement delayed confirmation mechanisms for timeout scenarios4. **Pre-caching**: Cache critical data early in the transaction lifecycle5. **Monitoring**: Set up comprehensive monitoring for race conditions and sync failuresThese strategies address the core synchronization challenges identified in your payment gateway architecture and should significantly reduce transaction failures due to timing issues.",

    "answer": "Sync tasks are scheduled agnostically of the initiation call to handle potential system failures.

In that scenario, the scheduled sync is necessary to reconcile the transaction's status.",

However, I can provide insights from related scenarios:## Identified Synchronization IssuesFrom the documentation, there are several instances where timing and sequencing of tasks create problems:### 1. Race Conditions in Event ProcessingThe analysis of UPI Settlement Mismatch reveals a critical race condition where:- The `upi_callback_consumer` service commits final 'SUCCESS' status to the database **before** the initial `U30` transaction state has been fully processed- This circumvents the intended event-sourcing pattern because state changes aren't atomically reflected in reconciliation staging tables### 2. Async Processing Without Proper DependenciesIn the forex rate caching implementation , there's a similar pattern where:- The system performs offline transaction synchronization via `syncOfflineTxns` endpoint- FX rates are cached at sync time rather than waiting for the actual transaction initiation- This creates a timing mismatch where rates may be stale by the time transactions are actually processed### 3. Token Management Scheduling IssuesThe ICICI OAuth refresh problem shows another example where:- Background tasks are scheduled (token refresh every 15 minutes) without proper coordination with actual API call timing- This leads to authentication failures when the scheduled refresh doesn't align with actual usage patterns## Root Cause PatternThe underlying issue appears to be **lack of proper dependency management** in the task scheduling system. Tasks are being scheduled based on time intervals or external triggers rather than waiting for prerequisite operations to complete.Would you be able to provide more specific details about:1. Which particular sync tasks you're referring to?2. What type of transaction initiation calls should be happening first?3.

Here’s what’s happening:1. **Missing Configuration in Sandbox**: The `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` configuration was not properly released/deployed in the sandbox environment [referenced in Slack message].2. **Scheduler Bypass Logic**: Because this configuration is missing in sandbox, the system is incorrectly skipping the scheduler process, even though the merchant (`tvsmotor`) should be processed through the normal refund scheduling flow.3. **ProcessTracker Issue**: The refund was added to ProcessTracker but is not being executed properly due to the configuration mismatch between what the code expects and what’s actually deployed in sandbox.## Additional ContextThere’s also a separate API flow issue with CCAvenue that’s worth noting:- CCAvenue returns a \"Success\" response for refund initiation requests, but the actual refund status needs to be checked via the `getRefundDetails` API call- This creates a discrepancy where the system thinks the refund succeeded when it may still be pending## Immediate Solutions1. **Deploy Missing Config**: Ensure the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` configuration is properly deployed to the sandbox environment2. **Add Merchant to Config**: If instant refunds are desired, add `tvsmotor` to the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` list3. **Check ProcessTracker**: Debug why ProcessTracker isn’t executing the scheduled refunds even when they’re added to the queue4. **Verify Scheduler Service**: Ensure the refund scheduler service is running properly in sandbox and can process the `refund_sync_frequency_intervals` (currently set to 300 seconds/5 minutes)The JIRA ticket **EUL-18115** has been created to track this issue.

According to the analysis, even after enabling TVS Motor on this configuration, the problem persisted because of how CCAvenue handles refund responses .The core issue is that CCAvenue returns a Success Response at the API level for refund requests, but the actual status of the refund is only available when calling `getRefundDetails` . This means that even with instant execution enabled, the system was still showing success based on the initial API response rather than the true refund status .Due to this continuing issue, TVS Motor was actually removed from the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` configuration, but the system is still initiating refunds directly to CCAvenue and giving a SUCCESS response .

Make the initial refund request to CCAvenue2. **Immediately follow up** with a `getRefundDetails` call to get the actual refund status3. Use the status from `getRefundDetails` (not the initial API response) to determine if the refund was successful### Current Status:- TVS Motor has been **removed** from the `refund_instant_execute_enabled_merchants` configuration- The system is currently giving a \"SUCCESS\" response based on CCAvenue's misleading initial response- This creates a poor user experience because users think the refund succeeded when it may have actually failedThe fix requires a code change to the refund processing logic, not just a configuration flag change.",

For example, document describes how weak cipher suites like `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA` can cause handshake failures and recommends using modern cipher suites like `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`.## Recommended Resolution1. **Check TLS Configuration**: Verify that both the client (Juspay) and SIMPL's API endpoint are using compatible TLS versions and cipher suites.2. **Header Normalization**: Ensure that the request headers being sent to SIMPL match the successful pattern - remove or adjust the additional headers (`Content-Type`, `x-art-recording`, `Accept`) that appear in failed requests.3. **SSL/TLS Debugging**: Enable detailed SSL debugging to identify the exact point of handshake failure.4. **Cipher Suite Alignment**: Work with SIMPL's technical team to ensure cipher suite compatibility, similar to the ICICI Bank coordination mentioned in document .The issue is currently being tracked and has been escalated to @Mariyam and @Richa for resolution .",

A race condition was identified in the `upi-common-library` during the NPCI OAuth token refresh cycle, where multiple Kubernetes pods would independently detect an expiring token and initiate refresh requests concurrently . This required implementing a locking mechanism in the `juspay-go-sdk/npci/auth` module .**HTTP Client Interceptor Logic**: The Go-based HTTP client's interceptor logic for various integrations was updated to better handle `401 Unauthorized` responses by triggering on-demand token refresh . Previously, the default retry mechanism would repeatedly send requests with expired tokens, which could affect header handling .**HyperSwitch Service Mesh Changes**: Multiple updates were made to the HyperSwitch routing engine, including modifications to `bin_routing_rules.yaml` files and routing configurations . These changes involved updates to payment routing logic and could have affected how headers are processed and forwarded to downstream services.## Configuration and Deployment Issues**ConfigMap Updates**: There were several instances of ConfigMap updates that caused routing issues, including incorrect rules in `payment-router-rules.yaml` and `payment_routing_rules` table updates . These configuration changes could have affected header processing logic.**Service Mesh Modifications**: Changes were made to the service mesh configuration, including updates to Kong API gateway settings and modifications to various microservices' HTTP client configurations .## Specific Framework Updates**Token Management Framework**: The `icici-token-refresher` Kubernetes cron job and related token management services underwent updates . Issues with pod evictions and resource contention affected token renewal processes, which could impact header authentication.**Circuit Breaker Implementation**: New circuit breaker patterns were implemented using Resilience4j within various connector microservices , which could have affected how headers are handled during failure scenarios.These infrastructure and framework changes, particularly around OAuth token management, service mesh configuration, and HTTP client interceptors, could collectively explain header modification issues when calling the SIMPL gateway.",

Kong API Gateway IssuesThere are documented issues with the Kong API gateway that could affect header processing :- HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout errors occurring at the Kong API gateway level- These issues were directly correlated with latency spikes and could indicate problems with header forwarding or modification### 3. HTTP Client Interceptor Logic ChangesA significant change was identified in the OAuth2 token refresh mechanism :- The Go-based HTTP client's interceptor logic was modified to handle `401 Unauthorized` responses- Previous implementation had flawed retry mechanisms that could affect header processing- Changes to how authentication headers are managed and refreshed### 4. HyperService Framework UpdatesReferences to the HyperService framework indicate:- Token management logic changes that could affect authorization headers- OAuth2 token refresh flows that modify authentication headers- Connection pool management changes that could impact header propagation### Potential Root Causes for Header Modification IssuesThe most likely candidates for causing header modification issues with the SIMPL gateway would be:1. **Kong API Gateway Configuration Changes** - Could affect header forwarding/modification rules2. **HyperSwitch Service Mesh Updates** - Changes to routing logic might alter header processing3. **HTTP Client Interceptor Updates** - Authentication header management changes could interfere with other headers4. **OAuth2 Token Refresh Logic** - New token refresh mechanisms might be modifying or overriding existing headersTo get more specific information about SIMPL gateway issues, you may want to check recent deployment logs, configuration changes to the Kong gateway, or updates to the HyperSwitch routing rules that might specifically affect SIMPL gateway integrations.",

    "question": "The merchant TimesPrime is facing issues with their LOYLTY Rewards integration in the sandbox environment. For one test card (4242...8007), the redeem option isn't appearing due to a 'Missing Mandatory Params PROGRAM_CODE' error. For another card (4357...4343), the redeem option appears but points are not deducted. What were the root causes and resolutions for these problems?",
    "answer": "The issues were diagnosed and addressed as follows:\n\n1.  **Card ending in 8007 (Missing Redeem Option):** The initial 'Missing Mandatory Params PROGRAM_CODE' error occurred because the corresponding `program_code` was not present in the sandbox database. The Loylty team provided the code ('YES DC'), which was then added. This led to a subsequent issue where the system incorrectly validated the 6-digit BIN as a US card. A fix for this was pushed to CUG. However, the latest error reported from the Loylty gateway for this card is 'Member Profile Not Found'.\n\n2.  **Card ending in 4343 (Points Not Deducted):** The failure to deduct points was caused by the Loylty 'fetch Balance' API timing out. The Loylty team suggested this might have been due to infrastructure changes on their end and asked to retry. A separate 'Invalid Client Auth Token' error was also encountered on the payment page; this was attributed to testing via Postman without passing a `customerId` in the `/cards/balance` API call.",

    "model_answer_non_agentic": "Based on the investigation into TimesPrime's LOYLTY Rewards integration issues, there were two distinct problems with different root causes:## Problem 1: Test Card 4242420100058007 - Missing Redeem Option**Root Cause:** The card's BIN (424242) was not configured to support LOYLTY rewards in the system . When checking the `/cards/balance` call, it returned the error \"Missing Mandatory Params PROGRAM_CODE\" because no outgoing call was being made to the LOYLTY Gateway . The Bin Info API showed `\"reward_supported\": false` and `\"reward_support_gateways\": []` for this card .**Technical Details:** The system wasn't recognizing this test card as eligible for LOYLTY rewards, so the \"Use Reward points to pay Redeem now\" option wasn't appearing on the payment page .## Problem 2: Test Card 4357083333374343 - Points Not Deducting**Root Cause:** There were two issues identified :1. **Missing Program Code:** For the corresponding program code `5278GHBM3806JJUW2267`, the program_code was not present in the sandbox database, causing the \"Missing Mandatory Params PROGRAM_CODE\" error .2. **API Performance Issues:** The fetch balance API was experiencing response timeouts due to high latency from the payment gateway side, with response times exceeding 10 seconds on first calls and around 5 seconds on subsequent calls .## Additional Context**Authentication Issues:** While the redeem option appeared for the second card when tested via Postman (returning successful balance response), the payment page showed authorization errors with `\"error_code\":\"access_denied\"` and `\"developer_message\":\"Invalid Client Auth Token or signature\"` . However, other API calls like SavedPaymentMethods were working fine with the same client_auth_token, indicating a specific issue with the balance API authentication .**Resolution Status:** The team was working on fixes for the missing program codes in the sandbox database and investigating the API timeout and authentication issues .",
    "model_answer_agentic": "Based on the search results from Slack conversations, I can provide you with the root causes and details about the TimesPrime LOYLTY Rewards integration issues in the sandbox environment:## Root Causes and Issues### Issue 1: Test Card 4242420100058007 - \"Missing Mandatory Params PROGRAM_CODE\"**Root Cause:**- The card bin (424242) was not configured properly in the sandbox database - The Bin Info API was not returning LOYLTY under `reward_support_gateways`, showing an empty array instead - The corresponding `program_code` for this card bin was not present in the sandbox database **Technical Details:**- The `/cards/balance` call was returning the error: `{\"error_message\": \"Missing Mandatory Params PROGRAM_CODE\", \"is_eligible\": false}` - No outgoing call was being made to the Loylty Gateway for balance checks - The Bin Info API response showed `\"reward_supported\": false` and `\"reward_support_gateways\": []` ### Issue 2: Test Card 4357083333374343 - Redeem Option Appears but Points Not Deducted**Root Cause:**- While the card was properly configured and the redeem option appeared, there was a functional issue where reward points were not being deducted from the transaction amount upon clicking \"redeem now\" **Technical Details:**- The `/cards/balance` call was working correctly, returning: ```json { \"reward_details\": { \"program_code\": \"OBC\", \"card_last_four\": \"4343\" }, \"balance\": 100, \"is_eligible\": true } ```- The Bin Info API correctly showed LOYLTY support: ```json { \"reward_supported\": true, \"reward_support_gateways\": [\"LOYLTYREWARDZ\"] } ```- Despite proper configuration, the points deduction functionality was not working as per the expected flow## Resolution StatusThe Slack conversations show that the issues were escalated to the appropriate team members (@Advait Mahesh, @Amit Shukla, @Komal, @Prabu M) for resolution . The specific resolutions implemented are not detailed in the available messages, but the problems were identified as:1. **Database Configuration Issue**: Missing program_code configuration in sandbox database for the first test card2. **Bin Info Configuration**: Incorrect reward gateway mapping for card bin 4242423. **Points Deduction Logic**: Functional issue with the reward points deduction process for the second test cardThe team was working on updating the sandbox database configurations and fixing the reward points deduction logic to resolve these integration issues.",
