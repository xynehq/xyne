Related to unique ID 155310.2. **PAY-6493** - Closed ticket related to Flipkart's performance bottleneck due to core banking system migration affecting settlement batch ID 980267.3. **PAY-7793** - Tracks issues with Flipkart's risk engine incorrectly flagging high-risk customer segments, causing KYC automation failures on refunds (UID: 983213).4. **PAY-8786** - Related to cross-border payment routing config error on Flipkart's end, affecting refund batch with unique ID 901105.5. **PAY-7701** - Tracks settlement discrepancy tied to PCI audit finding, unique ID 772610.6. **PAY-7511** - Contains financial impact numbers for cross-border routing config issue affecting batch ID 682508.7. **PAY-1780** - Tracks discrepancies from Flipkart's core banking system migration affecting batch ID 815197.8. **PAY-1992** - Related to forex rate handling issues for multi-currency refunds affecting batch ID 726743.9. **PAY-6807** - Tracks refund settlement mismatch for unique ID 256863 due to file processing lag on Flipkart's end.All of these tickets are part of the larger optimization effort tracked under work ID `318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9`. The issues range from technical configuration problems, fraud detection model sensitivity, KYC automation failures, to core banking system migration impacts affecting various settlement batches.",

    "Answer": "According to the hotfix plan (file `5b1d3e49f973459e`), the problem was a configuration drift in the Flink job. The `slidingWindow.interval` parameter was inadvertently reduced to 60 seconds from the specified 300 seconds during a Helm chart upgrade (`chart-version: 3.4.1`). This caused the 'Anomalous Refund Pattern' model to misinterpret short-term refund bursts as fraudulent activity.\n\nThe two-part plan to address this was:\n1.  **Immediate Hotfix:** Trigger a new Jenkins pipeline (`hotfix-PAY-1691`) to revert the `slidingWindow.interval` parameter back to 300 seconds in the staging environment, followed by a production rollout after validation.\n2.  **Future Prevention:** Implement a schema validation check within the CI/CD pipeline using Conftest to prevent similar configuration drifts in future Helm chart deployments.",
