Ran a few queries on BigQuery for that specific UPI transaction `384818`. Looks like a timing issue—our payment-gateway processed the initial success from NPCI, but we missed a delayed reversal update in the EOD recon job.

    "Answer": "Based on the documents, the following distinct root causes for Flipkart refund settlement discrepancies have been identified:\n\n1.  **Cross-Border Routing Error (Slack):** Anjali Patel mentioned a 'cross-border routing config error' impacting batch `unique_id: 303397` (JIRA PAY-7893).\n2.  **Delayed Reversal Update (Slack):** Arjun Mehta found a timing issue for a UPI transaction where a delayed reversal update from NPCI was missed in the EOD recon job (JIRA PAY-5030).\n3.  **Flink Job Config Drift (File):** The `slidingWindow.interval` parameter in a Flink job was incorrectly set to 60 seconds instead of 300, causing false positives with `FLAG_REASON_CODE: 701` (Velocity Check Mismatch) (JIRA PAY-1691).\n4.  **API Performance Bottleneck (Email):** Anjali Patel reported p99 latency on Flipkart's refund status API spiking to over 2,500ms, causing `ReadTimeoutException` errors (JIRA PAY-6691).\n5.  **Risk Scoring Engine Latency (Email):** Priya Nair identified performance degradation in Flipkart's real-time risk scoring engine, with p99 latency exceeding 2.3s, leading to `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors (JIRA PAY-8163).\n6.  **Missing International Flag (Email):** Siddharth Nair found that the `is_international: true` flag was missing from Flipkart's API payload for cross-border refunds, causing `Error Code: 5042 (Acquirer Mismatch)` (JIRA PAY-6869).\n7.  **API Rate Limiting (Email):** Arjun Mehta and Anjali Patel reported being aggressively rate-limited by Flipkart's API, receiving `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors and being throttled to 50-80 TPS (JIRAs PAY-5176, PAY-4596).\n8.  **KYC Automation Failures (Email):** Multiple emails from Priya Nair, Arjun Mehta, and Siddharth Nair describe various KYC failures for high-risk segments, resulting in errors like `KYC_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT` (Error Code: 4082), `403 Forbidden`, `KYC_VERIFICATION_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_DATA`, and `KYC_DATA_MISMATCH` (JIRAs PAY-7425, PAY-9997, PAY-4241, PAY-1054, PAY-4290).\n9.  **OAuth Token Refresh Timeouts (Email):** Anjali Patel and Priya Nair reported that requests with expired JWTs were taking over 2.5 seconds to respond instead of an immediate `401`, leading to `ReadTimeoutException` and `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors (JIRAs PAY-4147, PAY-2149).\n10. **Incorrect Settlement Cutoff Logic (Email):** Siddharth Nair hypothesized a discrepancy in settlement cutoff times for UPI refunds, where transactions after 18:00 IST were being incorrectly classified as T+1 by Flipkart instead of T+2 (JIRA PAY-7262).",

This is flagged as a major red flag for upcoming SOC 2 audits.\n4.  **KYC/AML Non-compliance:** Failures in the KYC verification process for high‑risk segments are a direct compliance concern under the RBI's Master Direction on KYC and AML guidelines.\n5.  **Cross‑Border Processing Violations:** Misrouting INR‑denominated transactions to EU clusters is noted as contravening RBI guidelines on data localization and payment processing. Other cross‑border issues pose risks related to FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) reporting.",
