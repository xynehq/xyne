    "Answer": "Based on the documents, the following distinct root causes for Flipkart refund settlement discrepancies have been identified:\n\n1.  **Cross-Border Routing Error (Slack):** Anjali Patel mentioned a 'cross-border routing config error' impacting batch `unique_id: 303397` (JIRA PAY-7893).\n2.  **Delayed Reversal Update (Slack):** Arjun Mehta found a timing issue for a UPI transaction where a delayed reversal update from NPCI was missed in the EOD recon job (JIRA PAY-5030).\n3.  **Flink Job Config Drift (File):** The `slidingWindow.interval` parameter in a Flink job was incorrectly set to 60 seconds instead of 300, causing false positives with `FLAG_REASON_CODE: 701` (Velocity Check Mismatch) (JIRA PAY-1691).\n4.  **API Performance Bottleneck (Email):** Anjali Patel reported p99 latency on Flipkart's refund status API spiking to over 2,500ms, causing `ReadTimeoutException` errors (JIRA PAY-6691).\n5.  **Risk Scoring Engine Latency (Email):** Priya Nair identified performance degradation in Flipkart's real-time risk scoring engine, with p99 latency exceeding 2.3s, leading to `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors (JIRA PAY-8163).\n6.  **Missing International Flag (Email):** Siddharth Nair found that the `is_international: true` flag was missing from Flipkart's API payload for cross-border refunds, causing `Error Code: 5042 (Acquirer Mismatch)` (JIRA PAY-6869).\n7.  **API Rate Limiting (Email):** Arjun Mehta and Anjali Patel reported being aggressively rate-limited by Flipkart's API, receiving `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors and being throttled to 50-80 TPS (JIRAs PAY-5176, PAY-4596).\n8.  **KYC Automation Failures (Email):** Multiple emails from Priya Nair, Arjun Mehta, and Siddharth Nair describe various KYC failures for high-risk segments, resulting in errors like `KYC_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT` (Error Code: 4082), `403 Forbidden`, `KYC_VERIFICATION_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_DATA`, and `KYC_DATA_MISMATCH` (JIRAs PAY-7425, PAY-9997, PAY-4241, PAY-1054, PAY-4290).\n9.  **OAuth Token Refresh Timeouts (Email):** Anjali Patel and Priya Nair reported that requests with expired JWTs were taking over 2.5 seconds to respond instead of an immediate `401`, leading to `ReadTimeoutException` and `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors (JIRAs PAY-4147, PAY-2149).\n10. **Incorrect Settlement Cutoff Logic (Email):** Siddharth Nair hypothesized a discrepancy in settlement cutoff times for UPI refunds, where transactions after 18:00 IST were being incorrectly classified as T+1 by Flipkart instead of T+2 (JIRA PAY-7262).",

This is flagged as a major red flag for upcoming SOC 2 audits.\n4.  **KYC/AML Non-compliance:** Failures in the KYC verification process for highâ€‘risk segments are a direct compliance concern under the RBI's Master Direction on KYC and AML guidelines.\n5.  **Crossâ€‘Border Processing Violations:** Misrouting INRâ€‘denominated transactions to EU clusters is noted as contravening RBI guidelines on data localization and payment processing.
