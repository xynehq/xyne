Specifically, the MandateVelocityScorer-v2 model is incorrectly flagging legitimate mandate requests, leading to a 12% increase in transaction drops with the internal error code FRM-802: High-Velocity Mandate. This directly correlates with a drop in our mandate setup success rate from a baseline of 94% to 82% for high-volume merchants, a trend clearly visible in our Grafana dashboard 'upi-mandate-performance'.","The root cause appears to be an overly sensitive `vpa_velocity_threshold` within the model's configuration, which fails to properly account for legitimate bulk mandate creation scenarios such as subscription sign-up promotions. Additionally, the model's feature weighting for `device_fingerprint_entropy` seems disproportionately high, penalizing users who switch networks or utilize privacy-enhancing tools. These parameters are currently being read from our central Consul config store and are applied in real-time to the `upi_mandate_events` Kafka stream, causing immediate, widespread impact.","As an immediate containment strategy, we must deploy a hotfix to adjust the FRM-802 trigger threshold from a score of 0.85 to a more lenient 0.95. This should mitigate the acute customer impact. Concurrently, the data science team must initiate a retraining cycle for MandateVelocityScorer-v2, leveraging the incorrectly flagged transaction IDs from the past 48 hours (logged in our Elasticsearch cluster under the 'fraud_engine_logs' index) as a negative dataset. We will also prioritize the development of a shadow A/B testing framework to evaluate a new model version, v2.1, against the production model without affecting live traffic."],"owner":"Rohit Sharma","ownerEmail":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","photoLink":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/photo9","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","rohit.sharma@juspay.in","tech-leads@juspay.in","product-team@juspay.in","compliance@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"application/json","createdAt":1757910600000,"updatedAt":1757910600000,"refs":[{"refId":"452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2","refType":"work"}]}}

I've been investigating the latency spike in the real-time risk scoring engine for the UPI Mandate service, and it's definitely a bit concerning.\n\nBuilding on the preliminary analysis from file b1ced9640b604a7f, I can confirm we saw a major degradation. The event started around 15:10 IST. Our Grafana dashboards showed the p99 latency for the `/mandate/score-transaction` endpoint jumping from a baseline of ~210ms to a sustained 1.9s for about 15 minutes. This is well outside our 300ms SLA for this service and directly impacts our compliance with RBI's real-time processing guidelines.\n\nDrilling down with Kibana, the issue doesn't appear to be related to infrastructure resource exhaustion. CPU and memory utilization on the Kubernetes pods for the scoring service hovered around 70%, which is high but within operational limits. Instead, the logs point towards a bottleneck in our OAuth 2.0 token introspection flow. It seems the authentication service itself was slow to respond when validating the JWT tokens for these specific mandate creation requests. The error rate fortunately held steady at 0.15%, so we didn't drop transactions, but the added latency is unacceptable.\n\nAs a temporary mitigation, I’ve vertically scaled the authentication service pods, which has brought the p99 latency back down to around 400ms. It’s an improvement, but not a root cause fix. My primary hypothesis is a potential database connection pool exhaustion within the auth service, triggered by a pattern of requests specific to the new mandate flow.\n\nHere are the next steps:\n\n1.  **Immediate Action:** I will continue to monitor the service closely and keep the scaled-up resources in place to ensure stability for the rest of the day.\n2.  **Investigation:** I am initiating a deeper dive into the auth service's database query performance and connection handling. I'll be working with Priya from the database team on this. All findings will be tracked in JIRA PAY-4155.\n3.  **Long-term Fix:** We may need to implement a dedicated caching layer for token introspection or optimize the database queries being made by the auth service. This will be my priority for tomorrow.\n\nI’ll have a more comprehensive update with a root cause analysis by tomorrow morning. This issue is critical for Work ID 452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2, and I'm treating it with top priority.\n\nRegards,\n\nArjun Mehta"],"timestamp":1757912460000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2","refType":"work"},{"refId":"b1ced9640b604a7f","refType":"file"}]}}

I've been investigating from a compliance standpoint, and I'm afraid the situation is more critical than we initially thought.\n\nMy analysis of the Kibana logs from 14:15-15:00 IST today confirms a significant cross-border payment routing misconfiguration related to the UPI Mandate work (Work ID 452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2). We've identified approximately 2,150 domestic UPI transactions (`country_code: 'IN'`) that were incorrectly routed through our international payment gateway instead of the designated NPCI endpoint. This is a direct and serious breach of RBI's FEMA guidelines governing cross-border payments.\n\nThe preliminary analysis from `file#b1ced9640b604a7f` suggests that a faulty JWT claim within the OAuth 2.0 flow is the likely culprit, failing to correctly differentiate domestic vs. international mandates. This not only impacts our settlement reconciliation but also creates a significant regulatory exposure that requires immediate action and reporting. The audit trail for these transactions is now non-compliant.\n\nI have created JIRA PAY-3503 to track this as a P0 incident. We need to execute the following actions immediately:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Your team):** Initiate an immediate rollback of the problematic routing configuration deployed this afternoon. We cannot afford to have another transaction misrouted. Please confirm as soon as the rollback is complete.\n2.  **Engineering (Your team):** Conduct a full Root Cause Analysis (RCA). We must understand how this configuration passed all checks in the staging environment and wasn't caught by our CI/CD pipeline's validation steps.\n3.  **Data Team:** Please begin pulling a comprehensive list of all affected transaction IDs, amounts, and timestamps from the incident window. I will need this data within the next two hours for our preliminary report to the regulatory body.\n4.  **Compliance (Me):** I will start drafting the mandatory incident report.

Building on your findings in email b0bc09865e2f4193 regarding the cross-border routing anomalies, my team has confirmed the operational impact.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show a concerning spike in error code `U69` (Transaction not permitted by law/regulation) for international UPI Mandate transactions. The failure rate has jumped from our baseline of 0.2% to 4.8% in the last 6 hours, affecting roughly 20k transactions. From a risk perspective, this is a critical issue as it suggests a potential breach of our cross-border payment routing protocol, which has direct implications for RBI compliance.\n\nAs documented in JIRA PAY-9952, the root cause appears to be a misconfiguration in the Kubernetes deployment of our `upi-router-service`. The Kibana logs clearly show that the service is failing to initiate the required OAuth 2.0 flow and generate a valid JWT token for non-INR transactions, causing them to be rejected by the NPCI gateway. This bypasses the security controls we established for this flow, as specified in the initial spec (see analysis from file#b1ced9640b604a7f).\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n1.  **SRE Team:** Please prioritize the rollback of the `upi-router-service` to the last known stable version. The goal is to have this deployed to production within the next 90 minutes to mitigate further transaction failures.\n2.  **Dev Team (Priya):** Could you please investigate why our CI/CD pipeline's automated testing didn't catch this configuration error?

Building on that, the business impact is becoming a bit more severe than we initially thought, and I need to escalate the priority on this.\n\nThe false positive rate from our new fraud detection model for the UPI Mandate flow has jumped to an alarming 4.2% over the last 12 hours. Our Grafana dashboard (Payments Errors) shows a direct correlation with mandate creation failures, dropping our overall success rate from 98.5% to around 94.3%. For context, our acceptable threshold for false positives is below 1.0%, so this is causing significant customer friction and is a clear deviation from the performance metrics outlined in the project plan for Work ID 452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2.\n\nLooking at the Kibana logs, the issue seems to be concentrated at the pre-authorization stage of the `/v2/mandate/create` endpoint. The model appears overly sensitive to transaction velocity from newer device fingerprints, which is a common pattern for legitimate users setting up new mandates. This behavior seems inconsistent with the risk profile we defined in the initial spec (Doc#b1ced9640b604a7f).\n\nThis isn't just a technical metric; it's translating to a higher number of support tickets and complaints from several key merchant accounts who rely on recurring payments. We need to act quickly to avoid damaging these relationships and ensure we remain compliant with RBI's guidelines on customer experience without compromising on security.\n\nI’ve documented the core issue in JIRA PAY-3024. Here’s what I propose as immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Partial Rollback:** Can we deploy a canary release that routes ~25% of the mandate creation traffic back to the previous, more stable version of the fraud model? This would help us confirm if the new model is the root cause while mitigating some of the immediate business impact.\n2.  **Model Re-evaluation:** I need your team to urgently review the feature weights in the current model. The parameters causing this over-aggressiveness need to be identified and tuned. What's the feasibility of pushing a hotfix within the next 24-48 hours?\n\nLet’s set up a quick sync for tomorrow morning with Data Science to review the findings and agree on a path forward.

Building on the data points from your side and our internal investigation outlined in file 5b1d3e49f973459e, we've managed to isolate the root cause of the recent refund settlement discrepancies.\n\nSince your core banking system migration last Tuesday, we're observing a significant performance bottleneck that is directly impacting our automated reconciliation process. Our Grafana dashboards for payment operations are showing that the p99 latency on your primary refund status API endpoint is spiking from a stable baseline of ~400ms to over 2,500ms. These spikes correlate directly with our nightly settlement batch processing window.\n\nThis latency increase is causing API timeouts on our end, resulting in a 3.8% error rate for refund status checks. As of this morning, this has led to a backlog of over 14,500 refunds that our system couldn't automatically reconcile. We've been tracking this under JIRA PAY-6691. Our Kibana logs are filled with `ReadTimeoutException` errors pointing to your refund service endpoint. We've already ruled out any issues on our side related to our OAuth 2.0 token exchange or network connectivity; our other API integrations with you remain healthy with latency well within the 150ms SLA.\n\nThe main concern here is the direct impact on our ability to meet the T+1 settlement timeline, which carries significant compliance risk under current RBI guidelines. The manual effort required to clear this backlog is becoming unsustainable for my team.\n\nAs a potential path forward, could your team investigate the performance of the service layer that interacts with your new core banking system? It seems the synchronous nature of the API call is the primary issue. In the long run, transitioning to an asynchronous callback model for final refund statuses would be ideal, as it would decouple our systems from your internal processing latencies.\n\nFor immediate action, could you please:\n1.

We’re observing that this service is a blocking dependency for your settlement APIs, and its latency is directly impacting our reconciliation workflow for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9. \n\nSpecifically, our Grafana monitoring shows p99 latency for your refund status endpoint spiking from a normal baseline of ~180ms to peaks exceeding 2.3s. This is causing our service to hit its 2s timeout threshold, leading to a 3.2% failure rate in our automated reconciliation process. These failures are showing up in our Kibana logs as `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, this is becoming critical. The growing number of manual reconciliations is not only operationally intensive but also puts us at risk of violating RBI's T+1 settlement guidelines for UPI transactions. This situation is being tracked under JIRA PAY-8163, and the lack of a clean, automated audit trail for these transactions is a serious concern for our upcoming SOC 2 reporting cycle. \n\nCould your team please prioritize an investigation into the latency spikes? It would be helpful to know if there were any recent deployments or changes to the risk engine's logic that might be responsible. We've verified our OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token generation are functioning within spec, so we don't believe the issue originates on our side. \n\nHere are the immediate action items we need to address:\n\n1.  **Flipkart Engineering:** Please provide an initial RCA and an ETA for a fix by EOD tomorrow.\n2.  **Interim Solution:** To mitigate the immediate compliance risk, can you provide us with a daily delta file of the affected transactions? We can use the format outlined in `file#5b1d3e49f973459e` as a baseline.\n\nThis is a high-priority issue for us, and I’m concerned about the potential regulatory exposure.

We've dug deeper into the refund settlement discrepancy for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9, and our findings point to a critical routing configuration error.\n\nOur team has traced the issue in Kibana to a specific failure pattern with cross-border transactions. It seems that when a refund is initiated for a transaction with a non-INR currency code, your call to our `/v1/refunds/initiate` endpoint is intermittently misrouted, leading to a `502 Bad Gateway` on your end. The main problem is that our `/v2/settlement/reconcile` API is not receiving the failure data, so these refunds are effectively lost in the settlement file, creating a growing discrepancy.\n\nLooking at our Grafana metrics, the refund failure rate for these international payments has jumped to ~1.3%, impacting roughly 3,800 transactions over the past 48 hours. This translates to a settlement gap of approximately ₹1.9M. This is obviously a pressing issue, not just financially, but also from a compliance perspective. We're running up against RBI's T+1 settlement guidelines, and the lack of a clear audit trail for these failures is a red flag for our SOC 2 compliance.\n\nI've centralized all our findings, including detailed logs and affected transaction IDs, in JIRA ticket PAY-9329. This builds on the data in file#5b1d3e49f973459e and our earlier conversation in email#e12c294e1c3940bf.\n\nCould your team please prioritize an investigation into the currency/country routing logic within your payment gateway? We suspect the misconfiguration is happening just before the API call is made to us.\n\nTo get this resolved, I think a quick sync call is in order. Are you or a technical lead available tomorrow at 11:00 AM IST for a joint debugging session? We need to aim for a patch in staging by EOD tomorrow.\n\nRegards,\n\nSiddharth Nair"],"timestamp":1757911080000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.mehta@flipkart.com","aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"53a52db25bba49e3","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"4fbbd82a039f42cb","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

Regarding the reconciliation gaps you highlighted in email 7040d4d69f0a4a0f, I've completed an initial investigation into the multi-currency settlement process for Flipkart refunds.\n\nThe root cause appears to be linked to how our settlement-batch-processor service handles forex rate lookups for non-INR transactions, which is causing the discrepancies noted in JIRA PAY-5349. We've correlated this with our Kibana logs, which show intermittent API connection timeouts to our forex data provider during the nightly T+1 settlement window (approx. 01:00 - 03:00 IST). The P99 latency for this external endpoint is spiking above our 2000ms service timeout, leading the job to fall back on a potentially stale rate from our Redis cache. The error rate for these specific calls is hitting nearly 4%, which is unacceptable.\n\nTo address this as part of Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9, I’ve deployed a candidate fix to our staging environment. This change implements a more robust retry logic with exponential backoff for the forex API calls and tightens the cache TTL to 10 minutes to align with RBI's guidelines on currency rate application, as detailed in file#5b1d3e49f973459e. The OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token management with Flipkart's refund APIs are performing within spec, showing consistent response times under 250ms and zero authentication failures.\n\nLast night's simulated run on the staging environment processed a test batch of 50,000 multi-currency refunds. The results are promising: the discrepancy value dropped from an average of 1.2% to less than 0.05%, well within our acceptable threshold. The updated process maintained an average throughput of 4,500 TPS without degrading the performance of other parallel settlement jobs. You can view the performance metrics on our 'Staging-Settlement-Health' Grafana dashboard.\n\nMy primary action item is to get your team's validation on the reconciliation report generated from this staging run. I've attached it to this email. I’m a little concerned about getting this deployed before the next major settlement cycle, so a quick turnaround would be appreciated.\n\nNext Steps:\n1.  **Finance Team:** Please review the attached staging reconciliation report and provide sign-off by EOD tomorrow.\n2.  **DevOps (Arjun):** Pending approval, I will schedule the production deployment for our next available maintenance window (tentatively this Thursday, 23:00 IST).\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\nBest,\n\nArjun Mehta"],"timestamp":1757911140000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.sharma@juspay.in","rahul.verma@juspay.in","suresh.nair@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","rahul.verma@juspay.in","suresh.nair@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"7040d4d69f0a4a0f","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"664b37f4b39e4498","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on your points from email 4fbbd82a039f42cb, my team has completed a deeper analysis of the UPI refund settlement discrepancy, and the issue unfortunately persists.\n\nOur automated reconciliation engine has again flagged a shortfall in the T+1 settlement cycle for May 15th. We have identified 37 specific UPI refund transactions, amounting to a total of ₹48,350, that were confirmed as `REFUND_SUCCESSFUL` via your `/v1/refund/status` API but are conspicuously missing from the final settlement file (`FK_SETTLE_RFN_20240515_final.csv`) shared via SFTP. This is a recurring problem related to Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nFrom our side, we've verified the end-to-end flow. Our Kibana logs show successful `200 OK` responses for all corresponding status API calls, and the JWT tokens used in the OAuth 2.0 flow were correctly generated and accepted. The Grafana dashboard monitoring our NPCI gateway and your API endpoints shows no anomalous error rates or latency spikes; our p99 latency for the refund status API remained stable at ~350ms. The discrepancy seems to be originating downstream within Flipkart’s system, between the point of API confirmation and the batch process that generates the settlement report.\n\nThis is becoming a pressing operational and compliance concern. As you're aware, delays in refund credits beyond the stipulated T+2 timeline can attract scrutiny under RBI guidelines. I have updated the severity on JIRA PAY-5034 to reflect this urgency.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **Investigation:** Could your engineering team please investigate the root cause for these specific transactions failing to be included in the settlement file? We suspect a potential issue in the job that aggregates data for the final report.\n2.  **Data for Analysis:** My colleague, Aditya, has re-attached the detailed list of `juspay_order_id`s and corresponding bank RRNs in the spreadsheet `refund_discrepancy_may15.csv` (Reference: file#5b1d3e49f973459e) for your team to trace.\n\nWhile a manual settlement for the outstanding amount is a necessary short-term fix, we need a permanent resolution to this process gap. Can we schedule a 30-minute technical call tomorrow with your settlement and payments engineering leads to walk through the data flow? Please let me know what time works best.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAnjali"],"timestamp":1757911200000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@flipkart.com","settlements-team@flipkart.com","aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"4fbbd82a039f42cb","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"b01939696ed44325","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

This issue, tracked under JIRA PAY-7425 for our Flipkart Refund Settlement work (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9), is now escalating into a significant compliance and operational concern.\n\nOur analysis shows that for a specific cohort of users flagged by our internal risk engine, the API calls to your `/v2/customer/kyc/status` endpoint are failing with a concerning frequency. Kibana logs point to a high volume of `KYC_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT` (Error Code: 4082) responses, exclusively for users whose profiles trigger our high-risk criteria. The P99 latency for these specific calls is spiking to over 2.5s, far exceeding the 99.9% SLA target of sub-800ms and the baseline of 450ms we see for standard profiles. The error rate has jumped from 0.1% to 4.8% for this segment.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is becoming critical. These failures necessitate manual intervention, which breaks the automated audit trail mandated by the RBI's Master Direction on KYC. It creates verifiable gaps in our audit logs, which is a major red flag for our imminent SOC 2 audit. Our Grafana dashboard for the Flipkart integration shows a 22% increase in manual refund processing queues, a workload that is not sustainable and directly correlates with these KYC API failures.\n\nAs discussed in the analysis from email e12c294e1c3940bf, our leading hypothesis is that your backend systems may be applying stricter rate-limiting or a different processing logic for KYC checks on profiles you also deem high-risk, causing our server-to-server calls to time out. We have re-validated our OAuth 2.0 token generation and the JWTs are well-formed; the auth flow is nominal.\n\nCould you please have your engineering team prioritize an investigation of the logs for the transaction IDs compiled in file#5b1d3e49f973459e? We need to understand if there is any differentiated throttling or de-prioritization happening for these KYC checks.\n\nGiven the regulatory pressure, we really need a definitive root cause analysis and a resolution plan by EOD tomorrow. Your team's insight here is crucial to mitigate this compliance risk.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":1757911260000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@flipkart.com","flipkart.settlements@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"664b37f4b39e4498","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"ec3595e5558a4cf0","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

The issue stems from a cross-border payment routing configuration error, which is causing refund settlement failures during the T+2 cycle. I have to be honest, the compliance implications of this are making us a bit anxious, especially concerning RBI guidelines.\n\n**Technical Analysis & Findings:**\nWe've analyzed the Kibana logs for the transaction batch provided in `file#5b1d3e49f973459e`. The pattern is consistent: for refunds linked to original transactions made with international cards, the `refund.initiate` API call from Flipkart's end is missing the `is_international: true` flag in the payload. Our gateway relies on this specific flag to route the refund settlement through the correct international acquiring partner. Without it, the requests are incorrectly routed through our domestic UPI gateway, which then fails with an `Error Code: 5042 (Acquirer Mismatch)` during reconciliation.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show that the refund error rate for the cross-border BIN range has spiked to 3.8% over the past 48 hours, impacting about 1,500 transactions. This directly jeopardizes our ability to meet the strict settlement timelines mandated by RBI for cross-border funds, which is a major concern.\n\nThis entire issue is being tracked under JIRA PAY-6869 for end-to-end resolution.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation (Juspay):** Our finance team is already working on a manual reconciliation file for the failed settlements to prevent further delays, but this is not a scalable solution.\n\n2.  **Permanent Fix (Action on Flipkart):** We need your engineering team to urgently investigate and deploy a fix to ensure the `is_international` flag is correctly passed in the API payload for all cross-border transactions. This is critical for the long-term health and compliance of our automated settlement process.\n\nCould you please connect with your technical counterparts and provide an ETA for this fix? The backlog is growing, and we need to contain the compliance risk as quickly as possible. My colleague Ankit from the integration team is on standby to assist your developers with a joint debugging session if that would help expedite things.\n\nThis resolution effort is formally tracked under Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nAppreciate your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nBest,\n\nSiddharth Nair\nVendor Success Manager | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757911260000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["priya.sharma@flipkart.com","fin-ops@flipkart.com"],"cc":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","ankit.g@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"b01939696ed44325","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6e9d81aaa2ce458c","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on your analysis in email ec3595e5558a4cf0, I've investigated the root cause from an infrastructure and API perspective.\n\nOur monitoring confirms that we are being aggressively rate-limited by Flipkart's refund status API. Kibana logs are flooded with `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors from their `/refunds/v1/query` endpoint for the past 48 hours. Our Grafana dashboard shows our effective throughput for this specific job has been throttled to approximately 50-60 TPS, while our system is attempting to push over 250 TPS to clear the refund settlement file.\n\nThis has resulted in a significant processing delay, and our internal settlement queue now has a backlog of over 20,000 transactions. The P99 latency for the reconciliation service has consequently degraded from a healthy ~350ms to over 2.1s due to the constant failed requests and retries. While our Kubernetes deployment has scaled up the service pods to handle this, it's ineffective as the bottleneck is external. This is becoming a bit of a resource drain and is starting to trigger our high-latency alerts.\n\nThe primary concern here is the potential violation of our T+1 settlement SLA. Continued delays could create compliance and audit issues under RBI guidelines. This entire investigation is being tracked under JIRA PAY-5176 for the Flipkart Refund Settlement Discrepancy Resolution project (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9).\n\nHere are the proposed action items:\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation (Owner: Arjun Mehta):** I am deploying a hotfix to our staging environment to implement an exponential backoff with jitter for our retry logic against this specific Flipkart endpoint. This should reduce the pressure on their end and hopefully result in fewer `429s`. I aim to have this in production by EOD tomorrow, post-verification.\n\n2.  **Vendor Escalation (Owner: Business/Partnerships Team):** We need to urgently raise a formal request with our technical account manager at Flipkart to increase our API rate limit. Based on current and projected volumes, we require a minimum sustained throughput of 300 TPS. I've attached the analysis from file#5b1d3e49f973459e which supports this requirement.\n\nCould you please help facilitate the conversation with Flipkart? We need a resolution on the rate limit increase within the next 2-3 business days to prevent further impact on our settlement cycle.\n\nLet me know if you need any further technical data or logs to support the request.\n\nRegards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757911320000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","saurav.gupta@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"ec3595e5558a4cf0","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5e29d6a52b7b489b","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on your point from email 6e9d81aaa2ce458c, our investigation has confirmed the refund settlement discrepancy is being caused by severe API rate limiting on your end. For the past 8 hours, we've been receiving persistent `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors from Flipkart’s `/refund/initiate` endpoint.\n\nOur monitoring on Grafana (Dashboard: `Flipkart-Integration-Health`) shows this is throttling our refund processing to ~80 TPS, far below our required peak capacity of 250 TPS.

We're observing API calls to your `/v2/refunds/initiate` endpoint timing out consistently, even after our system successfully acquires a new JWT token.\n\nHere’s what our monitoring is showing:\n\n*   **Error Rate Spike:** Our Grafana dashboards show that error rates for this endpoint, which are normally below 0.2%, have spiked to 4.5%. The primary error is no longer just `401 Unauthorized` but persistent connection timeouts.\n*   **Latency Degradation:** The P99 latency has degraded from a baseline of ~250ms to over 2,800ms, which is well outside our agreed-upon SLA parameters. This indicates a processing bottleneck on your end post-authentication.\n*   **Log Analysis:** Our Kibana logs from the outbound Kubernetes pods confirm that the TCP connection is established, and the TLS handshake completes, but we receive no response from your server before our 3-second timeout threshold is breached. This is happening for roughly 1 in every 20 refund initiation requests.\n\nThis is creating a critical backlog in our T+1 refund settlement reconciliation process. We are now at risk of breaching RBI's prescribed TAT for customer refunds, which is a serious compliance concern for us. The full technical trace and affected transaction IDs have been appended to JIRA ticket PAY-2864 for your engineering team's review, building on the initial analysis from `file#5b1d3e49f973459e`.\n\nWhile your previous email (`e12c294e1c3940bf`) mentioned an ongoing investigation into the auth service, the current timeout issue suggests a more widespread problem, possibly with the application servers or load balancers handling the refund API traffic.\n\nCould your team please prioritize the following actions?\n\n1.  Provide server-side logs for the transaction IDs listed in PAY-2864 to help us correlate the timeouts.\n2.  Check for resource contention (CPU/memory) or network saturation on the infrastructure that serves the `/v2/refunds/initiate` endpoint.\n3.  Provide an updated ETA for a root cause analysis and a hotfix. We are becoming quite concerned about the growing number of unprocessed refunds.\n\nWe need to get this resolved urgently. Please let me know if a joint technical call with our and your engineering leads would help accelerate the debugging process.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nSiddharth Nair\nVendor Success Manager | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757911500000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["ankit.verma@flipkart.com","flipkart.fintech@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"6d55c3ea174440c2","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"4ce06223f23b44fe","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on the analysis from your last email (c9099a114f3445b9), I've managed to isolate the root cause of the refund settlement discrepancies we're observing.\n\nThe issue appears to stem from our KYC automation process failing for specific high-risk customer segments, which directly impacts the refund lifecycle. This is the primary focus of Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of what we've found:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** Our internal KYC verification service, which is triggered for refunds associated with high-risk user profiles, is correctly flagging these accounts for manual review as per RBI guidelines. However, our refund settlement module is not designed to handle this intermediate `PENDING_MANUAL_REVIEW` state. It expects an immediate synchronous `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE` response from the KYC check.\n\n2.  **Technical Log Analysis:** I’ve been digging through the Kibana logs for our Kubernetes-deployed settlement service, focusing on the transaction IDs you shared in `file#5b1d3e49f973459e`. For each failed case, our KYC service logs show a `status: PENDING_MANUAL_REVIEW` with our internal error code `4028`. The downstream refund processor then times out after its 2.5s threshold and incorrectly marks the refund as failed in our system, while on Flipkart's side, it's likely still considered processing.\n\n3.  **Metric Correlation:** Our Grafana dashboard for refund processing shows a clear correlation. The error rate for our refund settlement API spikes from a baseline of 0.1% to nearly 4.5% whenever we process a batch containing a high concentration of these user segments. This directly corresponds to the `4028` error count in our logs.\n\n**Proposed Resolution & Action Items:**\n\n*   **Immediate Mitigation:** We are preparing a script to manually re-trigger the settlement for the affected transaction IDs once our compliance team gives the manual KYC approval. I’ll coordinate with them to clear the current backlog. I've linked this entire thread and the logs to our internal ticket, **JIRA PAY-2802**, for tracking.\n\n*   **Long-Term Fix:** We need to update our settlement orchestration logic to accommodate this asynchronous KYC flow. The plan is to introduce a `PENDING_VERIFICATION` state into the refund state machine. The system will then poll for the final KYC status. This is a significant change, and the engineering team is scoping the effort now.\n\n*   **Question for your team:** To make the long-term solution more robust and avoid continuous polling, would it be possible for Flipkart’s user service to provide a webhook callback to a Juspay endpoint once a manual KYC review is complete? A real-time notification would be far more efficient than a polling mechanism and would align better with our target P99 latency of under 300ms for such status updates. This was briefly touched upon in our previous discussion referenced in email `e12c294e1c3940bf`.\n\nWe're treating this with high priority due to the direct impact on the customer experience and our T+1 settlement SLA. Let me know your thoughts on the webhook possibility so we can finalize the architecture for the permanent fix.\n\nBest regards,\n\nArjun Mehta"],"timestamp":1757911560000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.singh@juspay.in","flipkart-integration@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["rohan.sharma@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"c9099a114f3445b9","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"106bbe795e774749","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on that, our team has managed to pinpoint the root cause of the ongoing settlement discrepancies we're tracking under Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nThe issue stems from an intermittent failure in the OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow for your refund status API. Our reconciliation service, which calls your API endpoint to verify refund states, is experiencing significant timeouts. Our investigation indicates that when our service attempts to use a JWT that has just expired, instead of an immediate `401 Unauthorized` response, your authorization server is taking an unusually long time to respond. \n\nLooking at our Grafana dashboards, the p99 latency for these specific API calls is spiking from a baseline of ~250ms to over 2.5 seconds. This is causing `ReadTimeoutException` errors on our client-side, which runs within a Kubernetes cluster. Our Kibana logs show a direct correlation between these timeouts and failed OAuth token refresh attempts. This has pushed the error rate for our reconciliation job to nearly 4.5%, a significant deviation from our sub-0.1% operational SLA.\n\nThe business impact is getting critical. We are unable to programmatically reconcile a growing number of refund transactions, which is creating a manual overhead and poses a compliance risk against the RBI's T+1 settlement guidelines. As of this morning, the unreconciled transaction count is approaching 7,000.\n\nWe have ruled out internal network latency or resource contention on our end. Our hypothesis is that there may be a performance issue on your authorization server's token validation logic. We are implementing the OAuth flow as defined in the documentation we received during onboarding (ref: email e12c294e1c3940bf).\n\nTo move forward, could your API platform team please investigate why requests with expired JWTs are resulting in a ~2.5s response time instead of an immediate rejection? The attached log file (file#5b1d3e49f973459e) contains specific trace IDs and timestamps for the failed requests.\n\nInternally, we've logged this under JIRA PAY-4147 and are deploying a temporary fix with a more aggressive client-side timeout and a circuit breaker. However, this is just a stop-gap. A swift resolution from your end would be greatly appreciated.\n\nWould you be available for a quick 15-minute sync tomorrow with our engineering lead to go over this?\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757911620000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@flipkart.com","api.support@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"4ce06223f23b44fe","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"f4a54fd229d1468b","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on your points in email 106bbe795e774749, our team has conducted a more detailed investigation into the API timeouts.\n\nThe root cause appears to be a systemic issue with the OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow, which is having a direct impact on our ability to process refunds. Our monitoring systems flagged this as a critical incident, and it's being tracked internally under JIRA PAY-2149.\n\nHere are our findings:\n\n1.  **API Performance Degradation:** Our Grafana dashboards showed a severe spike in p99 latency for the `/v1/refunds/settle` endpoint, increasing from our baseline of ~180ms to over 2.5s. This coincided with a 4.8% error rate, far exceeding our SLA threshold of 0.5%. These metrics were observed yesterday between 14:00 and 16:30 IST.\n\n2.  **Authentication Failures:** Correlating this with our Kibana logs, we've confirmed that each batch of `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors was preceded by a failed attempt to refresh the access token. Our system's requests to your `/oauth/token` endpoint are timing out after our standard 3-second connection timeout. Our client-side implementation is compliant with the flow detailed in Doc#f4a54fd229d1468b.\n\n3.  **Compliance and Reconciliation Risk:** From a compliance perspective, this is becoming a serious concern. The settlement failures are creating significant data discrepancies, which complicates our T+1 reconciliation process and puts us at risk of breaching RBI's refund processing TATs. The lack of a definitive success/failure response from the API during these timeouts also compromises the integrity of our audit logs, which is a key requirement for our SOC 2 compliance.\n\nGiven that our requests aren't even receiving an error response, we suspect a performance bottleneck or perhaps an unannounced rate limit on your authentication service. Could your team please urgently investigate the server-side application and load balancer logs for our client ID during the incident window?\n\nAs a clear action item, we need you to confirm if any changes were made to the token service and to analyze its performance under load. We have updated the list of impacted refund IDs in file#5b1d3e49f973459e for your cross-verification.\n\nLet's connect for a brief technical call tomorrow morning if the issue isn't resolved by EOD today.

Building on your message from yesterday (ref: email f4a54fd229d1468b), our SRE team has completed a detailed investigation into the recent latency spikes observed with the real-time risk scoring engine, which is a critical component of the Flipkart Refund Settlement process (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9).\n\nOur findings point towards a performance bottleneck on the Flipkart side. Here’s a summary of what we've observed:\n\n**Performance Metrics & Analysis:**\n*   **Latency Spikes:** Our Grafana monitoring (Dashboard: `FK-Refund-Performance`) shows that between 16:20 and 17:05 IST yesterday, the p99 latency for your risk scoring API endpoint surged from a baseline of ~250ms to intermittent peaks of up to 2.1s. This is well outside our operational SLA.\n*   **Internal Verification:** We have thoroughly audited our internal systems. Our Kubernetes pod resource utilization (CPU/Memory) was stable during the incident window. Network latency from our egress points to other external services remained nominal. Our OAuth 2.0 and JWT token validation layer also performed within its 50ms budget, so we can confidently rule out authentication overhead.\n*   **Log Correlation:** Digging into our Kibana logs, we can see the entire time delta is consumed between our API call initiation and the reception of your response. There are no connection timeouts or packet-level errors on our side, which isolates the delay to your service's processing time.\n\nBased on this data, our hypothesis is that the latency is originating from within your risk scoring service, possibly due to a resource-intensive database query under load or a cascading delay from a dependent microservice.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\nTo move this forward, could your engineering team please investigate the following on your end?\n\n1.  **Review Service Logs:** Analyze the application and system logs for your risk scoring engine corresponding to the timeframe of 16:20 - 17:05 IST yesterday.\n2.  **Database Query Performance:** Please check for any long-running or inefficient database queries triggered during this period. The list of `juspay_transaction_id`s from the affected window, which you can correlate, is attached in the previously shared `file#5b1d3e49f973459e`.\n3.  **Downstream Dependencies:** Verify the performance of any internal microservices that the risk engine relies upon for its scoring logic.\n\nWe've created JIRA PAY-8008 to track this issue formally.

That data was instrumental in helping us accelerate the investigation for the ongoing refund settlement discrepancy, tracked under JIRA PAY-8919.\n\nWe've completed the root cause analysis. The issue was traced back to a misconfiguration in our payment routing service that handles cross-border transactions. A new ruleset deployed yesterday incorrectly flagged a specific range of international card BINs as domestic, causing our system to route refund requests for these transactions to the incorrect settlement processor. This triggered the `INVALID_ROUTING_ID` error from your `/v2/refunds/initiate` endpoint, which we were able to correlate in our Kibana logs.\n\nOur Grafana monitoring (dashboard: `Payments-Volume`) shows a clear spike in 5xx errors on this endpoint to 4.2% between 14:30 and 16:00 IST yesterday, affecting approximately 1,250 refund transactions. This misrouting, while brief, posed a potential compliance risk concerning RBI's FEMA reporting, making its resolution our highest priority.\n\n**Resolution and Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Hotfix Deployed:** We deployed a hotfix at 17:45 IST yesterday to correct the BIN identification logic. The fix was validated against a sample of the failed transactions in our staging environment before being pushed to production. Post-deployment monitoring shows refund success rates have returned to the normal <0.1% error threshold.\n\n2.  **[Juspay] Re-initiation of Failed Refunds:** We are now initiating a batch job to re-process all 1,250 affected refunds. We anticipate this process will be completed within the next 2 hours.\n\n3.  **[Flipkart] Confirmation Request:** Could your team please confirm once this re-processed batch is visible in your settlement system? This will help us verify that the reconciliation is on track from your end.\n\n4.  **[Flipkart] Reconciliation File:** To formally close out this incident (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9) and the associated JIRA ticket, could you share the final reconciliation file for today's settlement (T+1) once the batch is processed?\n\nI’ve cc'd my manager, Aditya, to keep him in the loop. We appreciate your team's quick turnaround and collaboration on this. It’s been a bit of a scramble, but I'm confident the issue is now fully resolved.\n\nBest regards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757911680000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@flipkart.com"],"cc":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.s@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"6b0a685449d3491c","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"7913fec56a8a433d","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

My team and I have completed a root cause analysis, and we've identified a direct correlation between the refund settlement discrepancies and a specific failure in our automated KYC process for a subset of your customers.\n\nOur investigation, tracked under JIRA PAY-9997, reveals that the issue stems from API calls to your `/v2/customer/kyc/verify` endpoint. Specifically, for customers our internal risk engine flags as 'high-risk' (based on transaction velocity and value thresholds), our system attempts an enhanced, real-time KYC check before processing the refund. These API calls are consistently failing.\n\nLooking at our Kibana logs, we're seeing a high volume of `403 Forbidden` responses for these requests. Our Grafana dashboard shows the error rate for this specific endpoint spiking to over 15% during the refund processing window, a significant deviation from the usual <0.2% error rate. This is happening despite the OAuth 2.0 bearer token being valid and having the correct scopes, which we've cross-verified against the spec from our last integration sync.\n\nAs a direct result, our compliance module, which is built to adhere strictly to RBI's KYC and AML guidelines, is programmatically halting the refund settlement. Without a successful KYC validation, we cannot proceed with the fund transfer. This is the source of the discrepancy between our settlement report and yours.\n\nTo move forward, could your technical team please investigate the following on your end?\n\n1.  Are our requests to `/v2/customer/kyc/verify` for these specific user segments being blocked by a WAF rule or another security layer on your side?\n2.  Has there been any change in permissioning or required scopes for this endpoint that we weren't notified about?\n\nWe have compiled all the failed `transaction_ids` along with the corresponding `trace_ids` from our logs into the attached sheet (ref: file#5b1d3e49f973459e) for your debugging purposes. The growing backlog of these refunds is a significant concern for both customer experience and our T+1 reconciliation timeline for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nI think a quick 30-minute call with our respective engineering leads might be the fastest way to resolve this.

Building on that, our team has completed a deeper dive into the ongoing Flipkart refund settlement discrepancy, and I need to flag this with some urgency from a compliance standpoint.\n\nOur investigation confirms that the root cause is a cross-border payment routing configuration error on your side. We're observing refund initiation requests for INR-denominated transactions being incorrectly routed to our EU-based cluster instead of the designated India cluster. This is causing significant reconciliation failures and, more critically, poses a compliance risk by processing domestic transactions outside the stipulated regulatory geography, which directly contravenes recent RBI guidelines on data localization and payment processing.\n\nHere are the technical specifics our team has gathered:\n\n1.  **Log Analysis:** Kibana logs show that refund API calls from your service IP range are intermittently hitting `api.eu.juspay.io/v2/orders/{order_id}/refunds`. These calls should be exclusively directed to `api.in.juspay.io`. The misrouted requests are failing our validation layer with error code `422_INVALID_CURRENCY_FOR_REGION` before they even reach the settlement system. I've attached a subset of these logs for your reference.\n\n2.  **Performance Impact:** Our Grafana dashboards show a direct correlation between these misrouted calls and latency spikes. The affected endpoint on the EU cluster is seeing p99 latencies of up to 2.1s, while our IN cluster maintains a healthy sub-350ms average. This routing issue is contributing to a 1.8% error rate on the overall refund processing flow, which is well above our 0.2% SLA threshold.\n\n3.  **Compliance & Reconciliation:** As a result of this routing error, approximately 3,400 refund transactions in the last 48 hours have failed to settle. This has created a backlog that requires manual intervention, delaying the T+1 settlement cycle. The attached reconciliation report (ref: file#5b1d3e49f973459e) details the affected `transaction_ids`. The entire issue is being tracked under JIRA PAY-8845.\n\nBased on the timeline discussed in email `e12c294e1c3940bf`, this appears to have started after your last production deployment. Our hypothesis is that a service discovery configuration or an ingress routing rule within your Kubernetes environment may have been incorrectly updated, leading to this traffic leakage.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Flipkart:** Could your payments engineering team please urgently review and correct the API endpoint configuration for your refund initiation service? All traffic for INR refunds must be directed to `api.in.juspay.io`.\n*   **Juspay:** Our team is standing by to support your investigation. Aditya's team can provide real-time log monitoring to confirm once the fix is deployed.\n\nGiven the compliance exposure and the direct impact on customer refunds, resolving this is our top priority for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9. Could you please provide an update on your team's findings by EOD today and a timeline for the fix? A quick 15-minute call tomorrow morning would be beneficial to ensure we are aligned.\n\nThank you,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":1757911740000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["ankit.verma@flipkart.com","payments.engineering@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"7913fec56a8a433d","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"b27c8d2271284bb0","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

My team and I have completed our initial analysis on the UPI refund discrepancy covered under Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nWe have managed to isolate the source of the mismatch. The discrepancy appears to be exclusively for UPI refunds initiated on your platform post-18:00 IST. Our system, in alignment with NPCI clearing cycles, marks these transactions for a T+2 settlement. The report you shared (file#5b1d3e49f973459e), however, seems to account for these within the T+1 cycle, leading to the daily reconciliation gap.\n\nHere’s a snapshot of our findings from the last 48-hour cycle:\n\n*   **Data Source:** Our analysis is based on correlating Kibana logs (index: `prod-settlement-reco-*`) against the transaction IDs in your report.\n*   **Discrepancy Volume:** We've identified a consistent set of approximately 2,100 transactions per day that are being mismatched. This represents about 0.8% of the total daily refund volume but is causing significant manual overhead for our finance team.\n*   **Technical Root Cause (Hypothesis):** Our UPI gateway correctly flags transactions with a `refund_initiation_timestamp` after 18:00 IST for the next settlement day (T+2). We suspect Flipkart's reconciliation logic might be using a different cutoff time or timezone configuration, which classifies these transactions incorrectly as T+1. We've traced this behavior in our Grafana dashboards, which show a spike in reconciliation failures precisely in the batches processed after this cutoff.\n\nAll our technical findings and relevant log snippets have been consolidated in JIRA PAY-7262 for a more detailed audit trail.\n\nTo move forward, could your engineering team please investigate the following on your end?\n\n1.  **Confirm the settlement cutoff logic:** Could you verify the business rule and timezone applied in your system for bucketing UPI refunds into T+1 vs. T+2 settlement files?\n2.  **Review API data:** We are consistently populating the `expected_settlement_date` field in our `refunds/v2/status` API response. Could you confirm if your system is consuming this field as the primary source of truth for the settlement date? Our API is performing well within SLA, with a P99 latency of 180ms.\n\nResolving this is becoming a bit urgent, as the manual reconciliation effort is not scalable and introduces a risk of non-compliance with RBI's refund TAT guidelines. We need to get our automated reconciliation success rate back to our target of 99.95%.\n\nHappy to jump on a quick technical call tomorrow with the relevant engineers from your side to walk through the data.

Building on the initial analysis from Priya in email b27c8d2271284bb0, my team has completed a deeper investigation into the refund settlement discrepancies, and I wanted to share our findings for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nThe core issue stems from a data mismatch between the initial refund transaction currency and the final settlement currency reported in the daily files. Our `refund-settlement-processor` service, which runs on our production Kubernetes cluster, is flagging a growing number of errors that we're tracking under JIRA PAY-6536.\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\n1.  **API vs. Settlement File:** When a refund is initiated via your `POST /v1/refunds/initiate` endpoint, it correctly includes the transaction's original currency (e.g., USD, AED). However, the corresponding entry in the daily settlement report (referenced from `file#5b1d3e49f973459e`) is consolidated into INR without providing the original currency, amount, or the FX rate applied. This is causing our automated reconciliation logic to fail.\n\n2.  **Impact Metrics:** Looking at our Kibana logs for the `settlement-reconciliation` service, we're seeing a consistent `CURRENCY_MISMATCH` error for approximately 1.8% of total refund transactions. While this seems low, it translates to thousands of manual interventions daily, especially during peak sales where refund TPS can exceed 15k. Our Grafana dashboard (`Refunds-Recon-Primary`) shows a steady climb in the unresolved queue, which is becoming a significant operational overhead and is a compliance concern.\n\n3.  **Compliance & Security:** This lack of transparency in the settlement file could become a critical issue during our next SOC 2 audit and for RBI reporting, which requires clear lineage for all foreign currency transactions. Our current OAuth 2.0 flow with JWT token auth is secure, but the data integrity post-transaction is the weak link.\n\n**Proposed Solution & Next Steps:**\n\nTo resolve this permanently and optimize the process, we need a more robust way to reconcile multi-currency refunds. We've outlined two potential paths, and I've detailed the full technical specifications in our internal document, Doc#9240e5f20ea8439c.\n\n*   **Option A (Preferred):** Enhance your settlement API. Ideally, you could expose a new endpoint, something like `GET /v1/settlements/refund/{refund_id}`, which would return a JSON object with `original_currency`, `original_amount`, `settlement_currency`, `settlement_amount`, and `exchange_rate_applied`. This would allow for near real-time reconciliation and reduce our T+1 reconciliation latency, which currently averages around 850ms per batch.\n\n*   **Option B:** Modify the existing daily settlement file (`file#5b1d3e49f973459e`) to include these additional fields. While less efficient than an API, this would be a viable interim solution.\n\nOur backend services are flexible, and we can quickly adapt our `settlement-processor` to consume either of these formats. We've already scoped the work on our side and could have it ready for staging deployment within one sprint following the finalization of your API contract.\n\nCould your team please review these proposals and let us know which approach is more feasible from your end? We're keen to get this resolved to ensure a 99.95% automated reconciliation rate and maintain our compliance posture.\n\nLet's schedule a brief technical call for early next week to align on the path forward.\n\nBest regards,\n\nArjun Mehta"],"timestamp":1757911860000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["ravi.kumar@flipkart.com","flipkart.tech@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"b27c8d2271284bb0","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"7da177f705a34067","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on the analysis from your last message (email 9240e5f20ea8439c), our team has completed a deep-dive into the refund settlement discrepancy under Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nOur investigation has confirmed that the root cause was a cross-border payment routing configuration error within our gateway. Between approximately 18:00 and 22:00 IST on Tuesday, a subset of international transactions were incorrectly routed through our domestic acquiring partner instead of the designated international payment processor. Kibana logs show these transactions originated from a specific European BIN range and were hitting the wrong processing endpoint, bypassing the necessary currency conversion and MDR logic.\n\nThis resulted in auth success but an immediate failure during the T+2 settlement reconciliation batch. The primary error code flagged by our system was `SETTLEMENT_CURRENCY_MISMATCH`. The financial impact is a reconciliation gap of approximately ₹3.8 Lakhs across 540 failed refund settlements. This is a bit of a headache, as this misrouting also creates a potential compliance deviation from RBI's guidelines for processing cross-border remittances, which we need to rectify immediately to maintain our SOC 2 compliance posture.\n\nTo address this, our engineering team has deployed a hotfix to our staging environment that corrects the routing rules in our Kubernetes configuration map. This ensures that transactions from the identified BINs are now correctly passed to the international processor via the appropriate OAuth 2.0 flow. Initial tests show latency is stable at ~850ms and the settlement file generation is accurate.\n\nAs discussed in our earlier conversation (ref: email e12c294e1c3940bf), we need your team's validation before promoting this to production. Can you please review the attached configuration diff (file#5b1d3e49f973459e) and confirm that the updated routing logic aligns with Flipkart's expected transaction flow for these card types?\n\nAll technical work and logs are being tracked under JIRA PAY-9427. We are on standby to push this fix live and begin reprocessing the failed settlements as soon as we get your confirmation. Given the compliance angle, we're hoping to get this resolved by EOD today.\n\nLet me know if you need any more data from our Grafana dashboards or have any questions.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAnjali Patel"],"timestamp":1757911920000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","rohan.mehra@flipkart.com","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["rohan.mehra@flipkart.com","finance.ops@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"9240e5f20ea8439c","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"f04cb429d0d548d7","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on your analysis in email 7da177f705a34067, I've dug into the compliance and system logs for the ongoing Flipkart Refund Settlement Discrepancy Resolution (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9).\n\nThe core issue appears to be a systemic failure in the automated KYC process for a specific 'high-risk' customer segment, which directly correlates with the refund settlement delays we're observing.\n\nHere's a summary of my findings:\n\n*   **Monitoring Data:** Our Grafana dashboard for payment operations shows a sharp increase in KYC verification API failures over the past 72 hours, specifically for transactions flagged by our internal risk engine. The failure rate for this cohort has hit 12%, while the baseline for other segments remains below 0.5%.\n*   **Log Analysis:** Kibana logs confirm that for these failed refunds, Flipkart's KYC verification endpoint is consistently returning an error code: `KYC_VERIFICATION_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_DATA`. This is happening post-authentication; the OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT tokens are valid, ruling out an auth issue.\n*   **Business Impact:** This has so far impacted ~1,500 refunds, holding up a settlement value of approximately INR 2.3 Lakhs. The manual verification fallback is creating operational overhead and is not sustainable. More critically, it puts us at risk of breaching RBI's mandated timelines for customer refunds, which is a significant compliance concern tracked under JIRA PAY-4241.\n\nThe issue seems to stem from a data mismatch between the payload we're sending and what Flipkart's system now expects for users categorized under the high-risk profiles defined in file#5b1d3e49f973459e. It's possible their validation logic was updated recently.\n\nTo resolve this, I propose the following immediate actions:\n\n1.  **Flipkart Team:** Could you please investigate the `KYC_VERIFICATION_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_DATA` error from your side? We need the exact schema or data points that are failing validation so we can adjust our API calls.\n2.  **Aditya:** Could you have your team collate a few anonymized request and response payload examples for these failed transactions? We'll need them ready to share with Flipkart's engineers.\n3.  **My Action:** I will schedule a joint call with the Flipkart technical and compliance teams for tomorrow to sync on this. The lack of automated KYC for this segment is a major blocker for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nWe need to get this resolved quickly to prevent further financial discrepancies and ensure we remain compliant.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":1757911980000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","finance.recon@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"7da177f705a34067","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"642f580106b646d4","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on the points you raised in your last email (ref: f04cb429d0d548d7), our team has dug deeper into the refund settlement discrepancies, and we have a strong lead.\n\nOur investigation points to a series of failures in our automated KYC verification service, specifically for customer profiles flagged as 'high-risk' by your system. This seems to be the root cause of the reconciliation issues we're tracking under Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nHere’s what we're seeing from our end:\n\n1.  **API Error Spike:** Our Kibana logs show a significant spike in `422 Unprocessable Entity` responses from our internal `/v2/kyc/verify` endpoint. This error pattern correlates directly with refund requests for the high-risk customer segment. We've attached a detailed log export to JIRA ticket PAY-4290.\n\n2.  **Performance Degradation:** The Grafana dashboard monitoring our payment infrastructure shows that for these specific cohorts, the P99 latency for the KYC service call is jumping from an average of 350ms to over 2.1s. This is causing timeouts in the upstream refund processing service, which has a stricter timeout threshold of 1.5s to maintain our overall settlement TPS.\n\n3.  **Impact on Settlement:** When a KYC check fails or times out, the refund transaction is automatically shunted from the standard T+1 settlement path to a manual review queue. This operational delay is the direct source of the discrepancy between Flipkart's refund initiation records and our final settlement reports, as analyzed in file#5b1d3e49f973459e.\n\nFrankly, this is becoming a bit of a concern. Beyond the immediate financial reconciliation headache, the resulting delay in processing these refunds puts us in a tricky position regarding RBI's mandated Turnaround Times (TAT). We need to get ahead of this quickly.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n*   **[Flipkart] Payload Analysis:** Could your team please re-examine the data structure in the API payloads for these high-risk customer profiles? We suspect there might be a subtle deviation from the API contract we established, perhaps in an optional field that our stricter validation schema is now catching. The original spec is in Doc#642f580106b646d4 for reference.\n\n*   **[Juspay] Resiliency Test:** Our engineering team (tracked in JIRA PAY-4290) is deploying a patch to our staging environment. This patch will introduce more granular error handling and temporarily relax a non-critical validation rule to test our hypothesis. We plan to run simulated transaction loads against it by EOD today.\n\n*   **[Joint] Debug Session:** Let's schedule a joint debug session for tomorrow at 11:00 AM IST to trace a few failed `juspay_txn_id`s from the latest batch. This will allow us to observe the OAuth flow and JWT token exchange in real-time. I will send out a calendar invite shortly.\n\nLet's sync up on the JIRA ticket with our findings. We're committed to getting this resolved before the next settlement cycle.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiddharth Nair"],"timestamp":1757912040000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@flipkart.com"],"cc":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","finops-alerts@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"f04cb429d0d548d7","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"30cada38493f419d","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on that, I've finished the initial analysis for the Flipkart refund settlement discrepancies under Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9, and the issue seems to stem from our KYC automation workflow.\n\nSpecifically, we're seeing a high rate of KYC verification failures for customer segments flagged as 'high-risk'. Our system, in line with RBI's AML guidelines, triggers a re-verification step for these refunds by calling Flipkart’s `/v2/customer/kyc/check` endpoint. This is where the process is breaking down.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show the error rate for this specific API call has spiked from our usual baseline of 0.2% to approximately 4.5% over the last 72 hours. Tracing the requests in Kibana, we're consistently receiving a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response with the payload `{ \"error_code\": \"KYC_DATA_MISMATCH\", \"message\": \"Aadhaar validation failed for high-risk profile\" }`. This isn't an authentication problem; our OAuth 2.0 JWTs are being handled correctly. The issue is happening at the data validation layer.\n\nThis is creating a bit of a downstream mess, as these failed KYC checks are blocking the refunds from being processed, leading to the settlement file discrepancies we're trying to resolve. It's putting our T+1 settlement SLA at risk, and the issue is being tracked urgently under JIRA PAY-1054.\n\nMy current hypothesis, building on the analysis from email e12c294e1c3940bf, is a potential schema or validation rule change on your side for this customer segment, which is now misaligned with the API contract specified in `file#5b1d3e49f973459e`. \n\nCould you please have your technical team investigate if any recent changes were deployed to the `/v2/customer/kyc/check` endpoint or the underlying data model for these profiles?

Building on your email 30cada38493f419d, we've correlated your findings with our internal monitoring for the Flipkart Refund Settlement Discrepancy Resolution (Work ID: 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9).\n\nOur investigation confirms that the performance bottleneck appears to be linked to your recent core banking system migration. We are seeing a direct impact on our refund reconciliation service, which is becoming a growing operational concern.\n\nHere’s a summary of what our systems are showing:\n\n*   **API Latency Spike:** Our Grafana dashboards are flagging a significant degradation in response times from your refund status API. The p99 latency has increased from our baseline of ~250ms to over 2.1s during peak reconciliation loads. This is causing cascading failures in our settlement process.\n*   **Elevated Error Rates:** We're observing a sustained error rate of ~3.8% for `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` responses. This is well above the 0.5% threshold stipulated in our SLA and is the primary driver for the discrepancies detailed in the reconciliation report (file#5b1d3e49f973459e).\n*   **Compliance Risk:** These delays are putting us at serious risk of breaching RBI's T+1 settlement TAT mandates. We need to resolve this urgently to maintain compliance and avoid potential penalties.\n\nWe've confirmed that our OAuth 2.0 client credential flow and JWT token management are functioning correctly, with no authentication-related errors logged in Kibana. The issue seems to be isolated to the server-side processing time on Flipkart's end following the migration.\n\nTo help us move forward, could you please provide the following?\n\n1.  **Deeper Diagnostics:** Can your engineering team investigate the performance of the database queries and any intermediary microservices that the refund API depends on? We suspect a specific query or service call to the new core banking system is the source of the latency.\n2.  **Granular Logs:** More detailed application-level logs, including database transaction times for the specific refund IDs in question, would be immensely helpful.\n\nOn our end, we have created JIRA PAY-9132 to track our mitigation efforts, which currently involve implementing a more resilient retry mechanism with exponential backoff. However, this is a temporary fix that doesn't address the underlying problem.\n\nI think a joint debugging session would be the most effective next step. Are you or a relevant engineer from your team available for a 30-minute call tomorrow to walk through the end-to-end flow and pinpoint the bottleneck?\n\nLet me know what works for you.\n"],"timestamp":1757912100000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@flipkart.com","settlements.tech@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"30cada38493f419d","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"420e36e3891144b1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on the points raised in email 359f2528fdfa4156, we've completed a deeper investigation into the multi-currency settlement discrepancies for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9, and the issue is becoming a critical compliance concern.\n\nOur reconciliation engine is consistently flagging a mismatch averaging around 0.8-1.2% for refunds processed in non-INR currencies, primarily USD and AED. After analyzing the logs in Kibana, we can confirm the issue is not related to API availability or latency; your `/refund/settlement` endpoint is responding within the ~850ms SLA. The root cause is the final settled amount in INR.\n\nThe settlement files, as per the format outlined in file#5b1d3e49f973459e, do not contain the specific forex conversion rate applied by Flipkart's system at the time of refund settlement. This opacity is a direct problem for our compliance posture. RBI guidelines on cross-border payments mandate fully auditable records for every transaction leg, including the precise forex rates. Without this data point, our automated audit logs are incomplete, creating a significant finding for our upcoming SOC 2 Type II audit.\n\nI've attached a snapshot from our Grafana dashboard that visualizes the discrepancy trend over the last 14 days. The spikes correlate directly with batches of international refunds. The core problem is a floating conversion rate that isn't being communicated back to us, either via the API or the daily settlement report.\n\nTo resolve this permanently, we propose an enhancement: please include the `forexConversionRate` and `settlementCurrency` fields in the JSON response payload for the `/refund/settlement` endpoint. This would allow our system to perform real-time validation and finally close these reconciliation gaps. We're tracking this requirement under JIRA PAY-3219.\n\nGiven the mounting pressure and our compliance deadlines, could your team please assess the feasibility of this API change and provide an estimated timeline by EOD tomorrow? It's quite urgent we get this resolved to avoid any regulatory flags.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPriya Nair\nCompliance Specialist | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757912160000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["arjun.mehta@flipkart.com","fk-finance-tech@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"359f2528fdfa4156","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"51516b0eaa76462c","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

It helped our team correlate the settlement report discrepancies with our internal logs.\n\nBuilding on that, our engineering team has analyzed the Kibana logs and the settlement files (ref: file#5b1d3e49f973459e) for the last 15 days. We’ve confirmed that the discrepancy issue, as part of Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9, is isolated to multi-currency refunds, primarily impacting transactions in USD and EUR.\n\nThe root cause appears to be a variance in the FX rate applied. Our `/v1/refunds` API currently triggers a settlement process that uses the FX rate at the time of the refund (T+1 or T+2), not the rate from the original transaction. This is causing reconciliation mismatches that are currently averaging 1.2%—well above our target SLA of 0.1%.\n\nTo address this, we've created a proposal under JIRA ticket PAY-8303. We suggest augmenting the refund initiation request payload to include an optional `original_transaction_details` object. This object would carry the `fx_rate` and `base_currency_amount` from the initial charge. This will allow our settlement system to use the definitive original rate, ensuring precise reconciliation and better compliance with RBI reporting standards for forex transactions.\n\nTo be honest, the manual effort to reconcile these differences is becoming a significant operational overhead, so we're quite keen to get an automated fix in place.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Flipkart:** Could your technical team please review the proposed API payload change detailed in JIRA PAY-8303?\n2.  **Juspay & Flipkart:** I'd like to set up a 30-minute call next week with your API integration engineers to discuss the implementation and address any concerns from your side.\n\nOnce we have alignment, our team can deploy the changes to our shared Kubernetes staging environment within 5 business days for UAT. Please let me know what day next week works for a quick technical sync.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiddharth"],"timestamp":1757912220000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.sharma@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["anjali.mehta@flipkart.com","finance.api@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"420e36e3891144b1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

Let's hope their fix comes through soon. 👍","name":"Anjali Patel","username":"anjali.patel","userId":"U33434861","createdAt":1757913000,"threadId":"1718898142","teamRef":"id:namespace:chat_team::T04T5CL7L","chatRef":"id:namespace:chat_container::C04T5CL7W","app":"slack","entity":"message","replyCount":0,"updatedAt":1757913000,"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"53a52db25bba49e3","refType":"email"},{"refId":"7040d4d69f0a4a0f","refType":"email"},{"refId":"4fbbd82a039f42cb","refType":"email"},{"refId":"664b37f4b39e4498","refType":"email"},{"refId":"b01939696ed44325","refType":"email"},{"refId":"ec3595e5558a4cf0","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6e9d81aaa2ce458c","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5e29d6a52b7b489b","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6d55c3ea174440c2","refType":"email"},{"refId":"c9099a114f3445b9","refType":"email"},{"refId":"4ce06223f23b44fe","refType":"email"},{"refId":"106bbe795e774749","refType":"email"},{"refId":"f4a54fd229d1468b","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6b0a685449d3491c","refType":"email"},{"refId":"0880c93cdb534bd4","refType":"email"},{"refId":"7913fec56a8a433d","refType":"email"},{"refId":"59c90ba34a584db0","refType":"email"},{"refId":"b27c8d2271284bb0","refType":"email"},{"refId":"9240e5f20ea8439c","refType":"email"},{"refId":"7da177f705a34067","refType":"email"},{"refId":"f04cb429d0d548d7","refType":"email"},{"refId":"642f580106b646d4","refType":"email"},{"refId":"30cada38493f419d","refType":"email"},{"refId":"359f2528fdfa4156","refType":"email"},{"refId":"420e36e3891144b1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"51516b0eaa76462c","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"d26934b7640141a4","refType":"event"}]}}

The preliminary analysis on Slack points to an issue with our fallback logic for customers flagged as 'high-risk' by the Fraud Detection Engine. The system isn't correctly routing these cases for manual review, causing settlement discrepancies. The goal of this session is to finalize the root cause and agree on an implementation plan.\n\nMy initial look at the Kibana logs (dashboard link attached) shows the KYC service receiving a `RISK_PROFILE_UNAVAILABLE` error from the FDE, but the subsequent trigger to the manual verification queue is failing with a permissions error. This seems to have started after the 'Euler-ledger-config-update' deployment (ID: `dep-ae8f12`) last Tuesday. It feels like a misconfigured IAM policy, but we need to confirm. Anjali, can you have the staging environment ready to test a potential policy change?\n\nProposed Agenda & Outcomes:\n1.  **Confirm Root Cause:** Rohan, can you walk us through the service interaction between KYC and FDE? Let's trace the transaction ID from the logs to pinpoint the exact failure point.\n2.  **Solution Design:** Decide between a hotfix (adjusting the IAM role) and a more robust change (e.g., adding a circuit breaker with an explicit alert). Sameer, need your input on whether the interim manual process is sufficient from a compliance standpoint.\n3.  **Action Plan:** Assign owners and ETAs for the fix, deployment, and post-release monitoring. The output of this meeting should be a clear plan we can add to the Confluence page for PAY-1917, which will unblock the final reconciliation script update.","status":"confirmed","createdAt":1757913540000,"updatedAt":1757915340000,"app":"google-calendar","entity":"event","creator":{"displayName":"Arjun Mehta","email":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in"},"startTime":1757913540000,"endTime":1757917140000,"joiningLink":"https://meet.google.com/d26-934b-764","permissions":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","rohan.desai@juspay.in","anjali.rao@juspay.in","sameer.gupta@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"19e13de69db94543","refType":"event"},{"refId":"5b1d3e49f973459e","refType":"file"},{"refId":"e12c294e1c3940bf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"53a52db25bba49e3","refType":"email"},{"refId":"7040d4d69f0a4a0f","refType":"email"},{"refId":"4fbbd82a039f42cb","refType":"email"},{"refId":"664b37f4b39e4498","refType":"email"},{"refId":"b01939696ed44325","refType":"email"},{"refId":"ec3595e5558a4cf0","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6e9d81aaa2ce458c","refType":"email"},{"refId":"5e29d6a52b7b489b","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6d55c3ea174440c2","refType":"email"},{"refId":"c9099a114f3445b9","refType":"email"},{"refId":"4ce06223f23b44fe","refType":"email"},{"refId":"106bbe795e774749","refType":"email"},{"refId":"f4a54fd229d1468b","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6b0a685449d3491c","refType":"email"},{"refId":"0880c93cdb534bd4","refType":"email"},{"refId":"7913fec56a8a433d","refType":"email"},{"refId":"59c90ba34a584db0","refType":"email"},{"refId":"b27c8d2271284bb0","refType":"email"},{"refId":"9240e5f20ea8439c","refType":"email"},{"refId":"7da177f705a34067","refType":"email"},{"refId":"f04cb429d0d548d7","refType":"email"},{"refId":"642f580106b646d4","refType":"email"},{"refId":"30cada38493f419d","refType":"email"},{"refId":"359f2528fdfa4156","refType":"email"},{"refId":"420e36e3891144b1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"51516b0eaa76462c","refType":"email"},{"refId":"1a25e0d307e44103","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b357407c533a45ca","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"1008682b42154c48","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ec4bd977074b4ffa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fe0db5e696a24265","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c1cbe6d0e91143ee","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"9ef9e9e634dd485c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ad7d2305d2d14200","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"98d2f3f888dc4851","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a39b0d94616f4d6f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"44c635cd07324998","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"bbf75a7ae45f477c","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8c93f39af06044e5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"fce5c74b2c854a05","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"0da085efce7949f8","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ac6ba0f69f98485d","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6465322333a54f14","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49b3eeab66164648","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"92dfe3b789ec42aa","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"84511f3c9d7544fb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c2cc85e8cc3c4d88","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3077aec8dadc4a02","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"4092930ebc0f4481","refType":"slack"}]}}

The core banking system migration seems to have introduced a bottleneck. My initial analysis points to the `settlement-batch-processor` service, which is showing p99 latency spikes up to 4.5s during the nightly refund file processing window. This is causing downstream reconciliation delays and has the potential to breach our SLA with Flipkart.\n\nThe Grafana dashboard (see linked Confluence page for snapshot) shows a direct correlation between batch size and database transaction lock contention within the Euler ledger service. I suspect the `update_refund_status` stored procedure is struggling with the new schema post-migration, which wasn't an issue on the legacy system. We need to validate this hypothesis and decide on a path forward, both for immediate mitigation and a permanent fix.\n\nProposed agenda & goals:\n1.  **Root Cause Validation:** Priya, can you walk us through the query execution plan for the `update_refund_status` procedure? I'm betting we're missing a critical index on the `merchant_transaction_id` post-migration.\n2.  **Short-Term Mitigation:** I propose we immediately reduce the default batch processing size in the processor's config from 10,000 to 2,000. This should reduce lock contention and stabilize the system.

Our Prometheus metrics show a sustained spike in HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses during the 02:00-04:00 UTC batch window, with our client hitting a hard ceiling of approximately 150 TPS. This throttling is creating a growing backlog in our refund reconciliation queue, managed via RabbitMQ, causing reconciliation delays that breach the 24-hour SLA. The current naive retry mechanism exacerbates the issue by contributing to request bursts that trigger the limiter almost immediately after a cool-down period, defeating its purpose.","To mitigate this, I propose implementing a client-side adaptive rate limiter using a token bucket algorithm within our `flipkart-connector` microservice. We will leverage the `resilience4j` RateLimiter module, configuring it with a `limitForPeriod` of 145 TPS and a `limitRefreshPeriod` of 1 second to operate just under the observed vendor threshold. For retries on 429s, the plan is to switch to a jittered exponential backoff strategy, with an initial interval of 500ms and a multiplier of 1.5. This configuration will be deployed as a feature flag managed by our internal config service, 'Hydra', enabling dynamic adjustments without a full redeployment. The changes are staged on the `feature/PAY-1229-adaptive-limiter` branch.","The immediate next step is to deploy this build to the `payments-staging-k8s-cluster` for a 48-hour soak test, closely monitoring the `flipkart_api_429_errors_total` counter in our Grafana dashboard. In parallel, we must formalize a request with Flipkart's technical account manager to increase our API quota to a target of 400 TPS, which aligns with our projected peak refund processing volume. A successful staging run will be followed by a production canary release targeting 5% of the reconciliation traffic, with a full rollout contingent on zero regressions in settlement success rates and a measurable reduction in queue depth on our Redis-backed retry store."],"owner":"Arjun Mehta","ownerEmail":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","photoLink":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/photo9","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arjun.mehta@juspay.in","tech-leads@juspay.in","product-team@juspay.in","compliance@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"application/json","createdAt":1757914200000,"updatedAt":1757914200000,"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"c668a3ec313b491a","refType":"event"}]}}

Regarding the UPI settlement mismatch you highlighted from yesterday's T+1 file (as per email 0cf90ecc5cb54b45), I've spent the morning investigating the root cause, and I have an initial report.\n\nThis is definitely a high-priority issue for the UPI Mandate Implementation project (Work ID 452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2), as these reconciliation gaps can have significant financial and compliance implications.\n\n**Investigation Summary & Findings:**\n\nI've analyzed the Kibana logs for our `upi-mandate-processor` service, cross-referenced transaction IDs against our payment gateway DB, and correlated them with the settlement report (`file#b1ced9640b604a7f`) from NPCI. Our core infrastructure, including the Kubernetes cluster health and database performance, remained stable with an uptime of 99.99% and p99 latency well under our 500ms SLA.\n\nThe discrepancy appears to stem from how our system is handling a specific subset of transaction statuses, particularly late reversals initiated by NPCI. Out of the ~50,000 transactions in the analyzed batch, we found a mismatch of roughly 0.28%, impacting 142 transactions.\n\nSpecifically, the issue is tied to transactions that initially receive a success confirmation but are later reversed by the remitter bank. Our system correctly logs the initial success, but the subsequent asynchronous reversal notification from NPCI (often with response code `U69 - Transaction timed out at bank`) is not correctly updating the final transaction state in our settlement ledger. It's getting logged correctly by the core API, but the reconciliation service isn't picking it up before the T+1 cutoff.\n\nI’ve tracked this behavior under JIRA ticket **PAY-6952**. This seems to be a logical flaw in our reconciliation job rather than a fundamental issue with the OAuth 2.0 flow or JWT token validation with the NPCI gateway.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Patch (Owner: Me, ETA: EOD Today):** I am developing a patch for the reconciliation service to explicitly query for these `U69` reversal events against successful transactions within the settlement window. I'll deploy this to the staging environment for validation before a production push.\n\n2.  **Data Correction (Owner: Payments-DBA Team, ETA: Tomorrow, 12 PM IST):** Once the patch is validated, we'll need to run a correction script to update the final status of the 142 affected transactions to 'REVERSED' to ensure our books are balanced.\n\n3.  **Enhanced Monitoring (Owner: Me, ETA: End of week):** I'll add a new alert on our main Grafana payments dashboard (grafana.juspay.in/d/abc123/payments-latency). This alert will trigger if the discrepancy between our internal 'SUCCESS' count and NPCI's settled transaction count exceeds a 0.1% threshold for any given T+1 cycle. This should help us catch similar issues proactively.\n\nAs a follow-up to our earlier discussion in email a5f262d5d63e4011, I will also reach out to our NPCI contact to get formal confirmation on the expected processing window for these late reversals. Any delay on their end directly impacts our reconciliation window.\n\nLet me know if you have any immediate questions. I'll keep you updated on the progress of the patch deployment in the JIRA ticket.\n\nBest,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer"],"timestamp":1757913480000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2","refType":"work"},{"refId":"0cf90ecc5cb54b45","refType":"email"},{"refId":"b1ced9640b604a7f","refType":"file"},{"refId":"a5f262d5d63e4011","refType":"email"}]}}

Your concerns are absolutely valid, and I’ve spent the morning conducting a deeper dive from a compliance and regulatory perspective. I have to say, the issue is more significant than we initially thought.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, the current UPI mandate framework, as documented by NPCI, is explicitly architected for INR-denominated transactions. The introduction of multi-currency settlements for recurring payments immediately brings Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) regulations into scope, which our current integration is not equipped to handle. Our SOC 2 and RBI audit trails require meticulous logging of currency conversion rates, forex markup, and the underlying authorized dealer (AD) bank details for each cross-border transaction. None of this is currently supported.\n\nTechnically, this poses a direct threat to our settlement and reconciliation engine. The system is hardwired to parse NPCI's T+1 settlement files based on a fixed INR format and match them using the transaction RRN. Introducing foreign currency codes (e.g., USD, AED) without a corresponding settlement amount in INR and the applied FX rate would break our reconciliation logic. The 'UPI-Settlement-Health' dashboard on Grafana is currently showing a reconciliation success rate of 99.97%; I'm not comfortable risking that without a clear, tested path forward. I've been digging through Kibana logs for any past instances of non-INR transaction attempts, and they all result in a 'U16' error code (Invalid currency) from the NPCI gateway, as expected.\n\nI’ve cross-referenced this against the API specification in file#b1ced9640b604a7f and your notes from email#a5f262d5d63e4011. There are no endpoints to fetch certified FX rates or dedicated fields in the `/mandates/execute` API response to confirm multi-currency settlement details. This feels like a critical gap from NPCI's side.\n\nTo de-risk this for Work ID 452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2, we must obtain the following from NPCI before we commit any further engineering resources:\n\n1.  **Formal API Documentation:** Detailed specs for the multi-currency mandate and settlement flow, including error codes, authentication requirements (if different from the standard OAuth 2.0 flow), and settlement file formats.\n2.  **Regulatory Circular:** A formal notification or written confirmation from NPCI's compliance team on how this process adheres to RBI/FEMA guidelines.\n3.  **Sandbox Environment:** Access to a UAT environment where we can perform end-to-end testing of the entire lifecycle of a multi-currency mandate.\n\nI've updated the blockers and added these requirements to JIRA ticket PAY-2079. I think we need to formally escalate this to our relationship manager at NPCI. This is a significant blocker, and proceeding without clarity could put us at serious regulatory risk.\n\nLet’s connect later today to draft that communication.\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya Nair\nCompliance Specialist | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757913900000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2","refType":"work"},{"refId":"a319e7ad79454258","refType":"email"},{"refId":"b1ced9640b604a7f","refType":"file"},{"refId":"a5f262d5d63e4011","refType":"email"}]}}

Building on your analysis in email 902d9e2212db4e82, my team has confirmed the severity of the issue. The API timeouts are directly correlated with the OAuth token refresh failures for the UPI Mandate Implementation project (Work ID 452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2).\n\nThis is becoming a critical operational risk. Our Grafana dashboards show a worrying trend over the last 3 hours:\n- The error rate for mandate creation calls has spiked from our baseline of ~0.3% to 4.8%.\n- P99 latency has degraded significantly, moving from a stable ~220ms to over 2.1s, which is causing cascading timeouts for our merchants.\n\nDigging into the Kibana logs, we're seeing a pattern of HTTP 401 \"Invalid Token\" responses from the NPCI `/mandate/v2/create` endpoint. It appears our service is intermittently failing to refresh the JWT access token before it expires, leading to a series of failed requests. The root cause seems to be in the token refresh flow itself, not in the initial token generation. I've compiled the relevant log snippets and linked them in JIRA PAY-8439.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this instability puts us in a tricky spot regarding the RBI's e-mandate guidelines and could impact our upcoming SOC 2 audit if it persists. We need to demonstrate system reliability.\n\nI've already initiated a review of our implementation against NPCI's specs (as per `file#b1ced9640b604a7f`) and can't find an obvious deviation, which makes me suspect this might be an issue on the NPCI side, perhaps related to rate limiting on their auth servers, similar to what we discussed in `email#a5f262d5d63e4011`.\n\nHere’s the plan:\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation:** Can we deploy a hotfix to shorten the pre-expiry refresh window for these tokens in the staging environment? Let's reduce it from 5 minutes to 10 minutes to see if more aggressive refreshing helps.\n2.  **Engineering Deep Dive (Owner: Aditya):** Please prioritize PAY-8439. We need a root cause analysis on why the refresh mechanism is failing under load. Is it a concurrency issue within the Kubernetes pods or something else?\n3.  **External Communication (Owner: Anjali):** I will draft a formal inquiry to our technical SPOC at NPCI by EOD today. I'll include transaction IDs, timestamps, and our logs to expedite their investigation.\n\nLet's sync up for 15 minutes at 4:00 PM IST today to finalize the communication to NPCI and review the hotfix plan. I'll send out the invite. We need to get this under control before it impacts a larger volume of transactions.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjali Patel"],"timestamp":1757914200000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2","refType":"work"},{"refId":"902d9e2212db4e82","refType":"email"},{"refId":"b1ced9640b604a7f","refType":"file"},{"refId":"a5f262d5d63e4011","refType":"email"}]}}

Building on your analysis from email 5be432607c354cc1, I've investigated the compliance and operational impact of the ongoing Flipkart API rate-limiting issues.\n\nThe situation is becoming critical. Our Grafana dashboards confirm that between 14:00 and 17:00 IST daily, our refund reconciliation service throughput plummets from a target of 150 TPS to under 40 TPS. The Kibana logs are flooded with `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors from Flipkart's `/v2/payments/refund/status` endpoint. Our OAuth 2.0 flow is healthy, and JWTs are being generated and accepted, so this is purely a server-side throttling issue on Flipkart's end.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is a major concern. This throttling is creating a significant backlog, pushing our settlement times for a growing number of refunds past the T+1 SLA and into T+2 territory. This directly exposes us to potential non-compliance with RBI's defined Turnaround Time (TAT) for refund processing. The audit trail for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9 is starting to look problematic, and this will be a difficult point to defend during our upcoming SOC 2 audit cycle.\n\nI’ve updated JIRA PAY-4766 with these findings. As a short-term mitigation, can we prioritize implementing an exponential backoff mechanism in our reconciliation engine? It won't solve the root cause but should at least reduce the error noise and stabilize the service slightly.\n\nHowever, the long-term solution requires action from Flipkart. Based on the transaction volume analysis in file#49a3d287719c4892, we need a sustained throughput capacity of at least 200 TPS to clear the backlog and handle projected volumes. We need to formally request an increase in our API rate limit.\n\nRohan, could you please help identify the appropriate API platform or engineering team at Flipkart we can discuss this with? The current limits are severely hampering our mutual operations.\n\nLet's connect on this tomorrow to align on an escalation path.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPriya Nair\nCompliance Specialist | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757914860000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","rohan.verma@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"46eb0ace81f64429","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on the analysis from your last email (77dd690e10564777), our team has performed a deeper investigation into the ongoing UPI refund settlement discrepancy.\n\nWe're still observing a persistent mismatch between the refund statuses reported via your `/refund/status` API endpoint and the final settlement files (like the one referenced as file#49a3d287719c4892) we receive at T+1. The discrepancy rate is now hovering around 0.8%, which is unfortunately well above our acceptable threshold of 0.1% and is creating significant operational overhead for our finance team.\n\nOur engineering lead on this, Priya, has thoroughly analyzed the Kibana logs for all failed `refund_id` lookups over the past 72 hours. We can confirm that we are not seeing any timeouts, network issues, or non-200 responses from our side when polling your API endpoint. Our Grafana dashboards show a stable p99 latency of ~220ms for these calls, which is well within the expected performance envelope.\n\nThe core issue, as tracked in JIRA PAY-8724, appears to be a state mismatch within Flipkart's downstream systems. We successfully initiate the refund, receive an acknowledgment, but the final status communicated via API doesn't align with the settlement file. For instance, for `flipkart_refund_id: FKREF891234756`, your API returned `STATUS: PROCESSING` for about 12 hours before changing to `STATUS: FAILED` with error code `E504_BANK_REJECT`. However, this specific refund was absent from the subsequent T+1 settlement failure report, leaving its status ambiguous. This is just one of over 150 similar cases from yesterday's batch.\n\nTo be frank, the manual reconciliation effort is becoming unsustainable, especially with the festive season approaching. We anticipate a 40% surge in transaction volumes, and we must have this automated process running flawlessly to remain compliant with RBI's T+1 settlement mandates.\n\nTo move this forward, could your technical team please:\n\n1.  **Investigate the state transition logic** between your refund processing engine and the settlement reporting system? We need to understand the lifecycle of a refund that is marked as `FAILED` in the API but doesn't appear in the reconciliation files.\n2.  **Provide us with more granular logs** for a sample of the affected `flipkart_refund_id`s? We've attached a new CSV to this email, building on the list from email#5be432607c354cc1, to help trace their journey through your infrastructure.\n\nI believe a quick, focused technical call is the best next step. I'll send a separate invite for a 30-minute sync tomorrow with engineers from both sides to debug this. Getting this resolved is a critical dependency for the overall success of Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nThanks for your continued support on this.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiddharth Nair\nVendor Success Manager\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757914920000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.sharma@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@flipkart.com","flipkart.payments@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","IMPORTANT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"77dd690e10564777","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"c3b76e06ee444a78","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on your analysis from email 46eb0ace81f64429, I've spent the morning investigating the root cause, as this is a critical blocker for the Flipkart Refund Settlement project (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9).\n\n**Investigation Summary:**\n\nAfter deep-diving into the Kibana logs and our Grafana dashboards for the KYC service, the issue appears to be localized to the enhanced verification step for customer profiles we've flagged as \"high-risk.\"\n\n1.  **System Behavior:** Our internal risk engine is functioning as expected. The problem occurs when our KYC microservice, deployed in the `payments-prod` K8s cluster, makes an API call to our third-party KYC vendor's `/v3/verify/enhanced` endpoint.\n2.  **Error Pattern:** We're observing a significant increase in `429 Too Many Requests` errors, coupled with intermittent `401 Unauthorized` responses. This is not a simple network issue, as standard verification calls to their `/v2/verify/standard` endpoint are processing normally with a p99 latency under 450ms.\n3.  **Root Cause Hypothesis:** The `401` errors are particularly concerning. My initial hypothesis is a problem with the JWT token management within the OAuth 2.0 flow specific to this \"enhanced\" scope. It seems their API gateway might be incorrectly invalidating our tokens under the concurrent load generated by a batch of high-risk refund requests. The p99 latency for this specific API call has degraded from a baseline of ~800ms to over 2.5s before failure, which points towards a bottleneck on their end.\n\n**Impact:**\nThese failures are triggering our fallback mechanism to manual KYC, which is creating a significant backlog. This directly jeopardizes our T+1 settlement SLA with Flipkart and introduces a compliance risk that could be flagged during our upcoming SOC 2 and PCI DSS audits. The full analysis with specific `trace-id`s is documented in JIRA PAY-1673 and the referenced log sample `file#49a3d287719c4892`.\n\n**Immediate Actions & Next Steps:**\n\n*   **[Done] Stopgap Measure:** I've deployed a hotfix to our KYC service with more aggressive exponential backoff logic for retries on 4xx errors. This has managed to bring the hard failure rate down from 5.1% to ~2.8%, but at the cost of increased overall processing time. It's not a sustainable solution.\n*   **[Action - Partner Team]** Rahul, could you please urgently engage our technical contact at the KYC vendor? We need to get on a call with their engineers by EOD tomorrow at the latest. We must get clarity on the exact rate limits for the `/v3/verify/enhanced` endpoint and have them investigate the `401` errors from their side.\n*   **[Action - Arjun]** I will prepare a more detailed technical brief with the request/response payloads and corresponding `trace-id`s to facilitate that discussion.\n\nLet's sync up on the JIRA ticket for further updates. We need to resolve this quickly to prevent further impact on the Flipkart settlement reconciliation.\n\nRegards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757914980000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","rahul.verma@juspay.in","neha.kapoor@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"46eb0ace81f64429","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"a8c473b13552445f","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

We're seeing a consistent discrepancy of approximately 0.8% on refund batches involving non-INR currencies, which is a bit concerning as it's preventing our automated T+1 reconciliation from closing cleanly.\n\nOur investigation, based on Kibana logs for our settlement processor and cross-referencing API call data, points towards a potential timing issue with the foreign exchange rate application. It seems the rate used at the point of refund initiation via your `/v2/refunds` endpoint is different from the rate applied during the generation of the final settlement file we receive via SFTP.\n\nFor a concrete example, we looked at `refund_id: FLIP-REF-735626-XYZ` from yesterday's batch. Our logs show the refund creation call returned an `exchangeRate` of 83.5 INR/USD. However, the corresponding entry in the settlement report (`file#49a3d287719c4892`) was calculated using a rate closer to 83.2, resulting in a minor but cumulative shortfall. This is becoming a significant operational overhead and raises questions for our RBI compliance audits regarding cross-border fund movements.\n\nTo address this, we have a couple of proposals, which we're tracking under JIRA PAY-6394:\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation:** Could you confirm if the exact `settlementExchangeRate` can be added as a column to the daily settlement report? This would at least allow our Ops team to perform manual reconciliation without having to reverse-calculate the rate.\n\n2.  **Long-Term Solution:** We strongly recommend enhancing the `/v2/refunds/status` API endpoint. Ideally, once a refund is processed and settled, a call to this endpoint should return the final `settlementAmount` and `settlementCurrency` (e.g., INR) alongside the original `refundAmount` and `refundCurrency` (e.g., USD). This would provide an immutable, auditable record directly via the API, eliminating any ambiguity. Our current OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token management can easily accommodate these additional fields without compromising security.\n\nThis resolution is currently our highest priority for the Flipkart integration.

Building on your email (a8c473b13552445f), I've been digging into our logs and have some findings to share regarding the latency spike.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show a clear anomaly. The P99 latency for our real-time risk scoring engine’s `/v2/risk/evaluate` endpoint, which normally operates around 150ms, spiked to over 2.5s during the incident window yesterday. This directly correlated with a surge in `504 Gateway Timeout` errors on refund transactions originating from Flipkart, pushing the error rate from a baseline of 0.2% to nearly 4.5% for that specific workflow. This is becoming a bit of a headache as it's impacting our settlement SLAs.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, these timeouts and subsequent refund failures are a significant concern. They directly impact our ability to adhere to the T+1 settlement cycle mandated by RBI guidelines and create a messy reconciliation trail, which is the primary focus of this workstream (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9).\n\nThe logs you shared in `file#49a3d287719c4892` were helpful, but they seem to stop just before the critical timeout period. To get to the bottom of this, as tracked in JIRA PAY-3791, we need a more complete picture from your end. Could your team please provide more verbose, end-to-end logs for a sample of the failed `transaction_ids`? We need to see the full request lifecycle, from your system's call to our `/payments/refund` endpoint, through the OAuth 2.0 token acquisition, to the final response received (or not received) from our API gateway.\n\nOur current working theory, which builds on the initial thoughts from email `5be432607c354cc1`, is that there may be a network-level delay or a bottleneck in the JWT token management on your side before the request even reaches our infrastructure. Our Kubernetes pods for the risk engine scaled as expected, and we're not seeing any CPU or memory constraints on our end.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Flipkart Team:** Please provide the detailed end-to-end transaction logs by EOD tomorrow, so we can perform a proper timestamp correlation.\n2.  **Juspay (My Team):** I will continue to work with our SREs to analyze network traces within our VPC to definitively rule out any internal bottlenecks.\n\nOnce we have your logs, we should be able to pinpoint the latency source. Let's plan for a quick sync call on Friday to review the combined findings.\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":1757915100000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@flipkart.com","settlements-dev@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"a8c473b13552445f","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"e970cd7622a546b6","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on your last update in email 33d51709421142ac, our team has done a deeper dive into the KYC automation failures that are causing these refund settlement discrepancies.\n\nWhile you suggested a possible issue with our OAuth token generation, our security and infrastructure teams have confirmed that our JWTs are being generated and presented correctly, and our OAuth 2.0 flow is operating within spec. We see no authentication-related errors in our logs.\n\nOur investigation points towards a performance issue on the Flipkart side, specifically with the KYC verification endpoint for high-risk customer segments. Here’s what we're seeing:\n\n1.  **High Latency & Timeouts:** Our Grafana dashboards show that calls to your `/kyc/v3/verify` endpoint are timing out consistently for a specific user cohort. While p99 latency for standard users is stable at ~350ms, for this 'high-risk' segment, it's spiking to over 4.5 seconds before our service times out. This is well above the 800ms SLA we agreed upon.\n\n2.  **Elevated Error Rates:** We are observing a 6.8% failure rate for these specific KYC checks, which directly corresponds to the volume of refunds falling out of the automated T+1 settlement batch. This is being tracked under JIRA PAY-8339. As you know, this manual fallback process is not sustainable and introduces significant compliance risk under current RBI guidelines.\n\n3.  **Log Analysis:** A review of our Kibana logs shows our system successfully initiates the request, but we receive a `504 Gateway Timeout` from your end. We have cross-referenced this with the analysis from our previous incident (ref: email#5be432607c354cc1) and the patterns are dissimilar, suggesting a new root cause.\n\nOur current hypothesis is that a recent change in your internal risk-scoring engine or a downstream dependency it relies on is causing this processing delay for high-risk profiles. This is causing a cascade failure in our refund settlement process, which is the focus of Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nTo move forward, could your team please:\n\n*   **Investigate the performance** of the `/kyc/v3/verify` endpoint's underlying services, focusing on the processing path for high-risk user profiles.\n*   **Share server-side logs** for the list of `juspay_txn_id`s that I have compiled in the attached sheet (ref: file#49a3d287719c4892) for the timeframe of 08:00 to 14:00 IST yesterday.\n*   **Arrange a joint-debugging session** between your API engineering team and our payments integration lead, Priya Sharma. My calendar is open for any time tomorrow afternoon.\n\nThis is becoming a bit of a critical issue for our finance operations team, so a prompt investigation would be greatly appreciated. Let's get this resolved before the next settlement cycle.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiddharth Nair\nVendor Success Manager\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757915160000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["anuj.mehta@flipkart.com","fintech.partners@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"33d51709421142ac","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"8947e86b2137411d","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"},{"refId":"198514","refType":"event"}]}}

Regarding the refund settlement discrepancies you highlighted in email e970cd7622a546b6, I've conducted a deep dive into our infrastructure logs and API communication with Flipkart for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nThe investigation confirms our suspicion: the primary bottleneck is aggressive API rate-limiting on Flipkart's end. Our settlement reconciliation service is being systematically throttled when calling their `/v2/settlements/refunds/query` endpoint, resulting in a high volume of HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) errors.\n\nHere’s a summary of the impact:\n\n*   **Performance Degradation:** Our Grafana metrics show error rates for this specific job spiking to nearly 40% during batch runs. This has crippled our transaction throughput, reducing it from a target of 60 TPS to an unstable average of ~18-20 TPS.\n*   **Compliance Risk:** The direct consequence is a growing backlog of unprocessed refunds. We are now dangerously close to breaching the T+2 settlement SLA mandated by RBI guidelines for a substantial portion of these transactions. This is a serious compliance concern.\n*   **Latency Impact:** P99 latency for the API calls has surged from a healthy ~300ms to over 2.8s during periods of throttling, causing our job execution times to balloon.\n\nI've verified that our systems are not the cause. Our Kubernetes deployment for the settlement service is scaling as expected, and our OAuth 2.0 flow with JWT token management is stable with no authentication failures. The Kibana logs (see attached snippets in file#49a3d287719c4892) clearly show successful requests followed by a wall of 429s once a certain threshold is hit. This issue is becoming critical and is preventing us from meeting our core processing objectives.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **For Flipkart:** Rohan, could you please provide the specific rate-limiting configuration (both burst and sustained TPS) applied to our client ID? We urgently request that you increase our API quota to a minimum of 120 TPS. This aligns with the projected volumes discussed in our initial integration talks (ref: email#5be432607c354cc1) and is necessary to clear the current backlog and handle daily volume without violating compliance timelines.\n\n2.  **For Juspay (Internal):** As a temporary mitigation, I can introduce an exponential backoff with jitter into our API client. However, this is a stopgap measure that will further delay processing; it doesn’t solve the underlying capacity issue. I've updated JIRA PAY-7163 with these technical findings.\n\n3.  **Proposed Meeting:** I suggest we schedule a 30-minute technical sync-up call with the relevant engineers from Flipkart tomorrow to address the quota increase and establish a more scalable long-term path. \n\nWe need to resolve this bottleneck to ensure smooth settlement operations and maintain our compliance posture. Please let me know your availability for a call.\n\nRegards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757915220000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","rohan.verma@flipkart.com","priya.sharma@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"e970cd7622a546b6","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"a1dd6744b3754eb0","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on your findings in email 8947e86b2137411d, I've completed a deeper dive into the Flipkart UPI refund settlement discrepancy, and the situation is more critical than we initially thought.\n\nThe total variance over the last 72 hours has now crossed ₹1.2 Cr, impacting approximately 15,000 transactions. This is a material amount, and the delay in resolution from Flipkart's side is becoming a significant concern, especially with our T+1 settlement cycle.\n\nI've cross-referenced our settlement ledger against raw transaction data from the primary UPI gateway and Kibana logs. Our systems are functioning as expected. For the affected batch, our settlement service correctly processed the refunds, with state transitions from `REFUND_INITIATED` to `REFUND_SUCCESS` occurring at a P99 latency of 280ms. The NPCI response codes are clean, and there are no abnormal error spikes on our Grafana dashboards that would indicate a failure on our end.\n\nMy hypothesis aligns with the initial thoughts in file#49a3d287719c4892: the issue seems to stem from Flipkart's reconciliation logic. We are not seeing any API authentication failures on our end—our monitoring shows zero 4xx errors related to their calls, ruling out an OAuth 2.0 token expiry problem. It appears their system is either not correctly consuming the final status from our `/v2/orders/{order_id}/refunds` endpoint or is misinterpreting the settlement file we provide.\n\nThis prolonged discrepancy is a compliance risk that could draw scrutiny during our next RBI audit. We need to demonstrate decisive action.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Anjali (Me):** I will consolidate all discrepant transaction IDs, building on the list from email#5be432607c354cc1, and send a formal escalation email to our primary contacts at Flipkart by 4 PM IST today. This is for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\n2.  **Aditya (You):** Could you please pull a comprehensive log dump from our production Kubernetes pods for the settlement service? I need the full request/response payloads for the attached list of transaction IDs from the last 48 hours. This detailed evidence will be crucial for our call with them.\n\nI have updated JIRA PAY-2991 with these findings and am scheduling a mandatory follow-up call with the Flipkart finance operations team for tomorrow morning. We can't let this drag on any longer.\n\nLet's connect at 3 PM to quickly review the data before I send it out.\n\nThanks,\nAnjali\n\n--\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757915280000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"8947e86b2137411d","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"ae3700384d824477","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

The detailed transaction IDs and variance analysis are attached in the summary sheet (ref: file#49a3d287719c4892).\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, after analyzing the Kibana logs for payloads sent to our `/v1/settlements/reconciliation` endpoint, we've correlated the issue to inconsistencies in how foreign exchange rates are being reported in the settlement files. For a subset of transactions, the `finalSettlementAmount` does not align with the `baseAmount` and the implied exchange rate at the time of refund processing. This is particularly problematic as it violates the audit trail requirements under recent RBI circulars for cross-border payments, which mandate explicit recording of the applied FX rate for each transaction.\n\nTo ensure full compliance and streamline the reconciliation process, we need to enforce a stricter data contract. As discussed internally and referenced in JIRA ticket PAY-2626, we propose modifying the settlement file structure to mandatorily include the following fields for all multi-currency transactions:\n\n1.  `base_currency` (e.g., \"INR\")\n2.  `base_amount`\n3.  `settlement_currency` (e.g., \"USD\")\n4.  `settlement_amount`\n5.  `applied_fx_rate` (to 6 decimal places)\n6.  `fx_rate_timestamp` (ISO 8601 format)\n\nThis will eliminate ambiguity and allow our automated systems to perform precise T+1 reconciliation without manual intervention, which has become a growing operational burden. The previous discussion on this topic in email thread 5be432607c354cc1 hinted at this possibility, and I believe now is the time to formalize it.\n\nCould you please confirm with your engineering team if this schema modification is feasible on your end? We're a bit pressed on this, as our upcoming SOC 2 audit requires us to demonstrate a fully automated and compliant reconciliation process for all transaction types by the end of this quarter.\n\nLet me know if a quick technical call would be helpful to align on the implementation details. Happy to coordinate with Aditya and your dev leads.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":1757915340000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","rahul.verma@flipkart.com","sunita.patel@flipkart.com","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["rahul.verma@flipkart.com","sunita.patel@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"a1dd6744b3754eb0","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"72cebeab00364159","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on your analysis in email ae3700384d824477, our team has been digging into the root cause, and we have a strong lead.\n\nOur investigation points to a specific failure pattern linked to our KYC automation process for certain high-risk customer segments, an issue we're tracking internally under JIRA PAY-5540. It appears that when our fraud detection engine flags a user for enhanced due diligence post-transaction, the subsequent automated refund initiation is not being correctly reconciled in the nightly settlement file your system generates.\n\nLooking at the Kibana logs for the sample `merchant_refund_id`s you provided (e.g., `FK-REF-98721B3A`), we see our system correctly initiates the refund via a POST to your `/v2/payments/refund` endpoint. However, our system tags the transaction with a custom internal status, `KYC_VERIFICATION_PENDING_MANUAL_REVIEW`, before we receive the final confirmation. My suspicion is that your settlement reconciliation logic may not be configured to handle this state, causing these specific refunds to be dropped from the T+1 batch file. The attached analysis in file#49a3d287719c4892 provides a detailed log trace for three such instances.\n\nThe discrepancy volume is now hovering around 0.45% of our daily refund volume with Flipkart, which is becoming a bit of a blocker for our finance team's reconciliation efforts. This entire effort, tracked under our internal Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9, is a high priority for us to ensure we remain compliant with RBI guidelines on timely refund processing.\n\nOur engineering lead suggests a quick path to resolution would be for your system to correctly parse and include transactions in this `KYC_VERIFICATION_PENDING_MANUAL_REVIEW` state in the settlement file, even if as a pending item. Long-term, as we proposed in Doc#72cebeab00364159, aligning on a standardized set of status codes for these edge cases via the API would prevent future issues.\n\nCould your engineering team investigate if the reconciliation service can be updated to handle this status? We're ready to provide a comprehensive list of all possible transaction states from our end to support this.\n\nLet's schedule a brief 30-minute technical sync early next week to get the right engineers from both sides talking.

Building on the data you provided in email 72cebeab00364159, my team has completed a deeper dive into the UPI refund settlement discrepancies, and the issue is more persistent than we initially thought.\n\nOur reconciliation service flagged a 1.2% discrepancy rate in yesterday's T+1 settlement file (`FK_REFUND_SETTLEMENT_20241112.csv`, which I've re-attached from email 5be432607c354cc1 for clarity). This directly impacts our ability to meet RBI's mandated settlement timelines and is causing a growing number of exceptions for our finance team to handle manually.\n\nHere’s a specific example we traced:\n\n*   **Juspay Transaction ID:** `JUSPAY_TXN_524458F8D9E0`\n*   **Action:** Refund initiated via your `/v2/refunds/initiate` endpoint on Nov 11, 2024, at 16:15 IST.\n*   **API Response:** We received a `202 ACCEPTED` response immediately. Our subsequent polling of the `/v2/refunds/status` endpoint returned a final `\"status\":\"SUCCESS\"` at 16:18 IST. The average latency for this check is hovering around 250ms.\n*   **Discrepancy:** This transaction ID was completely missing from the T+1 settlement file generated on Nov 12.\n\nOur Kibana logs (query linked in JIRA PAY-6837) confirm that our production Kubernetes pods correctly processed the successful API response and marked the refund as complete in our system. However, the Grafana dashboard tracking 'Flipkart-Juspay Settlement Mismatch' shows this is not an isolated incident; the gap has been widening over the past 72 hours.\n\nOur primary hypothesis is that there might be a state synchronization issue between your real-time refund processing service and the downstream batch system that generates the daily settlement files. The API is confirming success, but that status isn't being reliably propagated for financial reconciliation. This creates a significant audit trail problem for us, especially concerning our SOC 2 compliance which requires immutable transaction logging.\n\nTo move forward on this (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9), could you please:\n\n1.  **Trace the lifecycle** of `JUSPAY_TXN_524458F8D9E0` within your internal systems? We need to understand why it was confirmed via API but excluded from the settlement report.\n2.  **Confirm the source of truth** for refund status. Is there a more definitive endpoint or perhaps an asynchronous webhook notification system we can subscribe to? Relying on a T+1 file with discrepancies is becoming operationally unsustainable.\n\nThis has become a high-priority issue. Our finance team is getting anxious about the reconciliation overhead. Can we schedule a 30-minute technical sync call with your engineering team tomorrow to discuss their findings and a path to resolution?\n\nRegards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757915400000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.sharma@juspay.in","finance.ops@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["sanjay.kumar@flipkart.com","flipkart.payments.integration@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"72cebeab00364159","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"8397f1b7d2ae4e15","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on your initial analysis in email 395899c53c144c8e, my team and I have been digging into the logs for the Flipkart Refund Settlement process (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9).\n\nThe root cause definitely appears to be a severe performance bottleneck with the new core banking system (CBS) that was migrated last week. The timing aligns perfectly with the start of the reconciliation failures.\n\nHere’s what we've found:\n\n1.  **Latency Spikes:** Our Grafana dashboards show that p99 latency for our internal settlement batch jobs is hitting 2.5s, a huge jump from our usual baseline of ~300ms. This is happening specifically when our `/v1/settlements/reconcile` service attempts to post ledger updates to the CBS.\n\n2.  **API Timeouts:** Reviewing the Kibana logs, we're seeing a cascade of `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors. The Kubernetes ingress controller for the CBS cluster is timing out requests, suggesting the CBS application pods are overwhelmed and not processing the queue fast enough during the T+1 settlement window.\n\n3.  **Inconsistent State:** The primary reconciliation job that ingests Flipkart’s daily refund file (ref: file#49a3d287719c4892) is failing mid-execution due to these timeouts. Since the job isn't fully atomic, these failures are leaving our ledger in an inconsistent state relative to Flipkart's records. This is causing the ~1.5% discrepancy rate we're currently fighting, which is a significant jump from our <0.1% SLA.\n\nThe immediate business impact is a growing financial liability and operational overhead. We're manually reconciling the fallout, but it's not sustainable and puts us at risk of breaching RBI's T+1 settlement timeline mandate. This also has potential implications for our SOC 2 compliance regarding data integrity.\n\nI’ve updated JIRA PAY-5518 with these technical findings.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **For the Engineering Team (Rahul):** Could you please prioritize investigating the CBS's database connection pooling and pod resource limits in the production K8s environment? The contention seems to be the primary cause, as we also noted in the early analysis in Doc#8397f1b7d2ae4e15.\n*   **For my Operations Team:** We will continue manual reconciliation to mitigate financial exposure and will keep providing daily fallout reports. However, we urgently need an ETA on a fix to manage expectations with the Flipkart team.\n\nI’m a bit concerned about the exposure here. Could we explore implementing a circuit breaker with an exponential backoff strategy in our settlement service? It would make the process more resilient to these CBS slowdowns while we work on the root cause.\n\nLet's connect first thing tomorrow to align on a concrete plan. I need to give a credible update to Flipkart by EOD.\n\nThanks,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757915400000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["rahul.verma@juspay.in","priya.sharma@flipkart.com","finance.ops@juspay.in","devops.team@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"395899c53c144c8e","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"9596ecc933a4413c","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

I've spent the morning analyzing the compliance and operational impact of this latency spike in our real-time risk scoring engine, specifically concerning the Flipkart Refund Settlement process (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9).\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is quite concerning. Our Grafana dashboards confirm the p99 latency for the `risk-scoring-service` surged to over 2.1s yesterday, a significant deviation from our ~450ms baseline. This isn't just a performance metric; it directly threatens our T+1 settlement SLA with Flipkart. Any delay in risk scoring means we might be processing fraudulent refund claims, which creates a financial liability and will certainly be a point of scrutiny in our upcoming SOC 2 and RBI audits. The audit logs are clear on the processing delays.\n\nDrilling down into the Kibana logs for the affected period, I'm seeing a high volume of `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors when the risk engine attempts to call a third-party data enrichment API. This corroborates the SRE team's initial findings. I've attached these specific log snippets and my analysis to JIRA PAY-2837. This issue resulted in a backlog of approximately 1,500 refund requests missing the T+1 cutoff. We had to process these manually in a subsequent batch, which is what triggered the discrepancy report from Flipkart's finance team this morning (ref: `file#49a3d287719c4892`).\n\nWhile engineering investigates the third-party service, we need to consider our own resilience. Do we have a circuit breaker or a fallback mechanism for this flow? For example, if the primary engine's latency exceeds an 800ms threshold, could we default to a simplified internal model for low-value transactions to ensure we meet the settlement window?

Building on the thread from email 9596ecc933a4413c, our engineering team has completed a root cause analysis for the ongoing refund settlement discrepancies (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9).\n\nOur investigation strongly indicates the issue stems from intermittent timeouts when our services attempt to refresh OAuth 2.0 access tokens via your `/auth/token` endpoint.\n\nHere’s a summary of our findings:\n\n1.  **Error Correlation:** Our Grafana monitoring dashboard shows a direct correlation between a spike in P99 latency for the `/auth/token` endpoint (exceeding our 2.5s connection timeout) and failures in our downstream refund reconciliation job. Error rates for these API calls have jumped from a baseline of <0.1% to approximately 4.5% over the last 48 hours.\n2.  **Log Analysis:** Kibana logs for our reconciliation service consistently show `java.net.ConnectException: Connection timed out` when trying to obtain a new JWT. This prevents us from authenticating subsequent calls to the `/v2/refunds/status` API, leading to the settlement data gap. The detailed log traces were shared earlier in file#49a3d287719c4892.\n3.  **System Impact:** The failed token acquisition is causing a cascade failure in our T+1 batch settlement process. This is creating a growing backlog of unverified refunds that require manual reconciliation, which is not scalable and introduces a risk of non-compliance with RBI's settlement TAT guidelines. As you know, maintaining accurate audit trails is critical for our SOC 2 compliance as well.\n\nThis issue has been formally tracked on our side under JIRA ticket PAY-3821.\n\nAs a temporary mitigation, we have considered increasing the client-side timeout. However, this is a band-aid fix that could negatively impact the performance of our Kubernetes pod resources. The core issue appears to be on the server-side, and it's becoming quite urgent to resolve this to avoid further settlement delays.\n\nCould your team please prioritize an investigation into the health and performance of your OAuth service? Specifically, we'd appreciate it if you could check for any performance degradation, recent deployments, or resource constraints affecting the `/auth/token` endpoint.\n\nLet me know if you need any further data from our side. We're keen to get this resolved today if possible.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiddharth Nair"],"timestamp":1757915460000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["rahul.verma@flipkart.com","payments.team@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"9596ecc933a4413c","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"931ad8de9ede45c8","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on the analysis from your previous email (d2d49c4e3db348bd), I've completed a deep dive on our side using the data from file#49a3d287719c4892.\n\nThe findings confirm the core issue we're tracking in JIRA PAY-4948. There's a persistent discrepancy in the UPI refund settlement statuses. We are consistently seeing a delta of ~0.75% between the refunds your system initiates via our `/v2/refunds/initiate` endpoint and the final settled transactions recorded in our T+1 reconciliation system. This is creating a fair amount of manual reconciliation work for our finance team, which is becoming a bit of a headache.\n\nFrom a performance standpoint, our systems are operating within expected parameters. Our Grafana dashboards show the P99 latency for our acknowledgement callback is stable at ~1.8s, well within the 2s SLA. Digging into the Kibana logs for the affected `merchant_order_id`s, the root cause appears to be a timing issue inherent to the UPI network's asynchronous nature. Our system correctly accepts the refund request and returns a `202 Accepted` status, but the final settlement confirmation from the remitter bank via NPCI can be delayed by anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes. Your system seems to be marking the refund as 'complete' based on our initial API acknowledgement, creating this state mismatch.\n\nTo resolve this permanently and ensure we are both fully aligned with RBI guidelines on timely and accurate refund processing, I'd like to propose we introduce a finality webhook. Instead of relying solely on the initial synchronous API response, your system could subscribe to an asynchronous notification that Juspay would trigger only *after* we receive the final RRN confirmation from the NPCI network. This would provide an immutable, bank-confirmed status for each refund, eliminating any ambiguity. This is a pattern we've used successfully with other partners, as briefly touched upon in email#5be432607c354cc1.\n\nThis new webhook would naturally be secured using our standard OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow with signed JWT payloads, ensuring it meets our mutual SOC 2 and PCI DSS compliance requirements.\n\nCould you please review this analysis with your team and confirm if your refund processing workflow can accommodate an additional asynchronous settlement confirmation? Getting this resolved is a high priority for the objectives outlined in Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nAs a next step, I will start drafting a technical specification for this proposed webhook. It would be great if we could get your initial thoughts on feasibility by EOD tomorrow so we can align on a path forward.\n\nThanks,"],"timestamp":1757915520000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.sharma@juspay.in","ankit.desai@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"d2d49c4e3db348bd","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"b26f5676f8c24e20","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

We've completed our initial investigation into the issue, and I wanted to share our findings and immediate actions for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nOur analysis confirms the issue originated on our end. After cross-referencing the transaction IDs from the report you shared (file#49a3d287719c4892) with our Kibana logs, we've traced the root cause to a recent update in our internal fraud detection model. The model was generating an excessive number of false positives for legitimate Flipkart refund requests.\n\nSpecifically, a new rule set deployed 72 hours ago seems to be overly sensitive. The false positive rate for Flipkart refund API calls surged from our baseline of 0.2% to approximately 4.5%. This triggered a `403 Forbidden` response with our internal error code `ERR_RISK_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED` for these transactions, which is why they failed to appear in the T+1 settlement files.\n\nTo mitigate this immediately, we have disabled the problematic rule in our production environment as of 14:00 IST today. Our Grafana dashboards already show the error rate for the refund endpoint has dropped back to the expected ~0.15%, and API latency is stable at 180ms P99.\n\nHere’s our plan moving forward:\n\n1.  **Reconciliation:** My team is manually compiling a list of all impacted refund transactions. We will process these via a back-office channel to ensure they are included in the next T+2 settlement cycle. We will share this reconciliation file with you for verification by EOD today.\n\n2.  **Permanent Fix:** Our Risk Engineering team has taken this up under JIRA ticket PAY-2172. They are working on refining the model's logic to better account for Flipkart's bulk refund patterns without compromising our risk posture. They will be using the last 30 days of data for retraining and will push the updated model to staging for validation by tomorrow.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the operational friction this has caused. We are treating this with the highest priority and will provide a full post-mortem once the permanent solution is deployed.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757915580000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["saurabh.gupta@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"931ad8de9ede45c8","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"762a279d80d74465","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on the points you raised in `b26f5676f8c24e20`, I've completed a full audit of the disputed transactions against our internal systems.\n\nMy team has analyzed the consolidated refund report (file#49a3d287719c4892) for the settlement period of June 10-12. While your report marks all 4,152 refunds as 'SUCCESS', our settlement system, which reconciles directly against NPCI's T+1 cycle data, shows a discrepancy for a subset of these transactions. Specifically, we've flagged 112 transactions amounting to INR 87,450.00 that are missing from the final settlement credit file we received.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, this is a pressing concern. Our internal audit logs are now showing an exception for these transactions, which directly impacts our ability to meet RBI's mandates on timely refund settlement and reporting. As you know, maintaining an immutable and verifiable audit trail is a critical SOC 2 requirement for us.\n\nDigging into our Kibana logs, we can see successful `200 OK` responses from your `/v2/refunds/status` API endpoint for these transaction IDs. However, the payload response appears to be inconsistent with the final settlement status. For instance, `txn_id: FLIPKART_REF_796761_A` was reported as 'PROCESSED' via API at 11:45 PM on June 11, but it never appeared in the subsequent settlement batch from your partner bank. This suggests a potential data sync issue between your application layer and your core banking settlement processor.\n\nThis entire investigation is being tracked under our JIRA ticket PAY-9200. To resolve this, could your engineering team please investigate the data flow for these specific 112 transaction IDs? A confirmation that the UTR numbers were correctly generated and included in the settlement file sent to NPCI would be the first step. If they were missed, we need to understand the root cause to prevent a recurrence.\n\nGiven the compliance implications, we're a bit stressed about getting this closed out. Could you please provide an update by EOD tomorrow?

Building on that analysis, our team has investigated the settlement failures, and we can now confirm the issue is tied to a cross-border payment routing configuration error.\n\nOur analysis of the Kibana logs shows that refunds for transactions made with international cards are not being routed correctly through our system. Instead of being directed to the appropriate cross-border settlement rails, they are being incorrectly pushed towards our domestic NPCI UPI gateway. This is causing an immediate rejection from the gateway and subsequent failure in our T+2 reconciliation cycle. This corroborates the initial hypothesis outlined in Doc#5008057bd56347a3.\n\nThe discrepancy rate is now hovering around 1.3% for the affected cohort, which is a significant operational drag and is triggering persistent alerts on our primary settlement Grafana dashboard. From a compliance perspective, this misrouting is a serious concern, as it creates reporting anomalies that could be flagged in our SOC 2 and RBI audits for cross-border payments.\n\nTechnically, we suspect the issue lies in how the payload is being constructed on Flipkart’s end before calling our `/v2/orders/{order_id}/refunds` endpoint. The `payment_details.country_code` field appears to be defaulting to 'IN' or is null for these transactions, which forces our system to treat them as domestic. Our API expects a non-IN ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code for these refunds to engage the correct processing logic.\n\nTo move forward, could your engineering team please prioritize an investigation into the refund request generation logic for international payments? We need to ensure the correct country context is passed.

Regarding the issue you acknowledged in email 5008057bd56347a3, our team has completed the root cause analysis for the settlement discrepancy tied to Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nOur investigation points directly to an OAuth 2.0 token refresh failure when our settlement service attempts to communicate with your refund API. Looking at our Grafana dashboards, we saw a clear correlation: P99 latency on the `POST /v1/settlements/refunds` endpoint spiked from our typical ~180ms to over 2.5 seconds. Simultaneously, our Kibana logs showed a surge in `HTTP 408 Request Timeout` errors, which were preceded by `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` responses during the JWT validation step. It seems our service's request to your `/oauth/token` endpoint was failing, causing it to fall back on an expired token, which was then rejected.\n\nThis led to a temporary but significant 4.5% error rate for refund settlements, creating a reconciliation gap that requires manual intervention. The full incident analysis is attached in file#49a3d287719c4892, building on our initial discussion in email#5be432607c354cc1.\n\nAs an immediate mitigation, we manually refreshed the token and executed a rolling restart of the affected pods in our Kubernetes cluster. This restored the service, bringing the error rate back to our standard <0.1% baseline. However, this is obviously not a sustainable solution.\n\nTo prevent a recurrence, we are implementing a more resilient token management strategy on our end, tracked under JIRA PAY-6191. The plan, as outlined in Doc#a4bb7f59cc4540da, includes proactive token refreshes (triggering 10 minutes before expiry) and an enhanced retry mechanism with exponential backoff for the token endpoint.\n\n**Action Item for Flipkart:** Could your team please review the server-side logs for your `/oauth/token` endpoint for the incident window (timestamps in the attached file)? We need to understand if our refresh requests were being rate-limited, throttled, or if there was any performance degradation on your end that we need to account for in our client logic.\n\nEnsuring this is resolved is critical for maintaining our T+1 settlement SLAs and for our audit trails required under RBI guidelines. We plan to deploy our client-side fix to our staging environment by tomorrow, EOD. Your input on the server-side behavior would be invaluable.\n\nLet me know if you need any further data from our side.\n\nRegards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757915640000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.sharma@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["rohan.kapoor@flipkart.com","settlements.tech@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"5008057bd56347a3","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"ea289a02acfc4e5e","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on your analysis in email a4bb7f59cc4540da, I've done a deeper dive into the Flipkart refund settlement discrepancy, and the situation is a bit more concerning due to the recent PCI audit finding.\n\nThe core of the issue, as tracked in JIRA PAY-6262, stems from a processing mismatch between our system and Flipkart's. Our Kibana logs show a persistent 4.5% error rate on the reconciliation job for Flipkart refunds over the past week. This directly corresponds to late settlement file deliveries via their `refunds/v2/settlement` API endpoint, often occurring outside the agreed T+2 settlement window. Our current reconciliation service, which runs as a batch job on our Kubernetes infrastructure, is timing out before it can ingest these delayed files. This leaves a significant number of transactions (~1,200 in the last 7 days, as per the analysis in file#49a3d287719c4892) in a `refund_processed` state in our system without being marked as `settled`.\n\nFrankly, this is a critical gap. The PCI auditors have flagged this as a failure to comply with PCI DSS Requirement 11.5 (timely detection and response to failures). They've given us a very tight deadline to present a concrete remediation plan, so we need to move quickly on this.\n\nHere’s my proposed two-pronged approach:\n\n**1. Immediate Mitigation & Escalation:**\n*   I will escalate this immediately with our technical account manager at Flipkart. We need to get a clear commitment on their API SLAs and understand why these delays are happening. This isn't sustainable.\n*   Priya, can you please coordinate with the SRE team to temporarily increase the reconciliation job's timeout threshold? Let's bump it from 30 minutes to 60 minutes and monitor the pod's CPU and memory usage via the Grafana dashboard. It’s a band-aid, but it might reduce the immediate backlog.\n\n**2. Long-Term Architectural Fix:**\n*   The batch job is clearly too brittle. We need to re-architect this flow to be asynchronous, which is something we touched upon in a different context (ref: email 5be432607c354cc1). I'm suggesting we implement a Kafka topic to queue the incoming settlement files from Flipkart. A separate consumer service can then process these files, decoupling ingestion from reconciliation.\n*   This approach would make our system resilient to Flipkart's API latency and provide much better observability. We can set alerts for queue length or processing time, allowing us to be proactive rather than reactive.\n\nLet's sync up tomorrow at 11:00 AM IST to finalize the details of the long-term solution before we document it for the auditors. I need both your inputs to ensure the proposed architecture is sound. I'll send out an invite for this meeting shortly.\n\nThis has to be our top priority for the week.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757915640000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@juspay.in","priya.sharma@juspay.in","aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"a4bb7f59cc4540da","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"037585f8e80949cf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

Building on your analysis in email ea289a02acfc4e5e, I’ve spent some time correlating the latency spike with our compliance monitoring dashboards, and I have a few concerns I need to raise.\n\nYesterday, between 15:30 and 16:15 IST, our Grafana board for the real-time risk scoring engine showed p99 latency for the `/v2/risk/score` endpoint jumping from a baseline of ~150ms to sustained peaks of over 2.1s, with some requests timing out completely after 2.5s. This directly contributed to a temporary increase in our overall error rate to 0.75% for the Flipkart settlement channel, primarily with `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is quite worrying. A latency of this magnitude means we are failing to apply our complete fraud detection rule-set for a subset of transactions before the upstream service timeout. This creates a potential exposure and deviates from the risk mitigation framework outlined in our last SOC 2 audit. We cannot afford to have these gaps, especially with the transaction volumes we're seeing with Flipkart.\n\nThe log excerpts I've compiled in `file#49a3d287719c4892` appear to rule out issues with the core UPI gateway or NPCI communication. The problem seems localized to the risk engine's data retrieval process, which feels reminiscent of the cache contention issue we tackled last quarter (ref: email#5be432607c354cc1).\n\nThis investigation is being tracked under Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9 and the engineering effort is captured in JIRA PAY-3822.\n\nHere are my immediate action items and asks:\n\n1.  **Engineering (cc: Rohan):** Can we please get a formal RCA that confirms whether this was due to Redis connection pool exhaustion or another infrastructure bottleneck? We need to document this for our next RBI audit cycle.\n\n2.  **Product (cc: Anjali):** We urgently need to define and document a fallback mechanism. If the risk engine times out, what is our default posture? Do we fail-open (approve transaction, accept risk) or fail-close (decline transaction, impact business)? This ambiguity is a significant compliance risk.\n\nI’m available to sync up first thing tomorrow to review the Kibana logs together and finalize the incident report. We need to move quickly on this to ensure our systems remain robust and compliant.\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":1757915700000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.gupta@juspay.in","anjali.sharma@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"ea289a02acfc4e5e","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"c68a79e53462425a","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

Regarding the refund settlement discrepancy issue, our team has completed a further investigation, and we believe we've isolated the root cause to a performance bottleneck originating from your new core banking system (CBS) integration. This is currently our most critical issue for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of what our systems are logging:\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show a significant degradation in the performance of your refund reconciliation endpoint post-migration. Specifically, the P99 latency for calls to your API has jumped from a healthy ~250ms to over 2.1s. This is causing a cascade of issues, including a timeout error rate increase from 0.1% to approximately 3.8%. Our Kibana logs (query attached to JIRA PAY-4893) are filled with `504 Gateway Timeout` errors, indicating our system isn't receiving a timely response.\n\nThis latency is severely impacting our automated T+1 settlement process. The reconciliation jobs are failing, which requires manual intervention from our finance operations team and puts us at risk of breaching RBI settlement cycle mandates. We've verified that our end of the OAuth 2.0 flow is functioning correctly; JWT tokens are being generated and presented without issue. The problem seems to lie purely in the server-side processing time on your end after successful authentication.\n\nTo move forward, we have a few urgent requests for your team:\n\n1.  **Investigate the API service layer** that sits between your public-facing endpoints and the new core banking system. The bottleneck likely resides here.\n2.  **Share server-side performance logs** for the specific transaction IDs detailed in the attached analysis (`file#49a3d287719c4892`). This will help us correlate our timeout events with your internal processing times.\n3.  Could you confirm if there are any pending optimizations on the database queries or connection pools for the new CBS? The behavior is consistent with resource contention.\n\nWe need to get ahead of this quickly. The reconciliation failures are creating a growing backlog, and it's becoming a bit stressful to manage manually. Can we schedule a brief, focused technical call tomorrow with your lead engineer on this project? I would like to include my engineering counterpart to align on a concrete resolution plan.\n\nLet me know what time works.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiddharth"],"timestamp":1757915760000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["anjali.verma@flipkart.com","fkt-finance.tech@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"037585f8e80949cf","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"9ecbbc4c80f34402","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

My findings point to a specific failure pattern in our KYC automation service that seems to be the origin of this issue.\n\nThe discrepancy, as highlighted in the reconciliation report (file#49a3d287719c4892), directly correlates with a spike in KYC validation failures for customers flagged under a 'high-risk' segment. Digging into the Kibana logs for our KYC service, I'm observing a high volume of `422 Unprocessable Entity` responses. This specifically occurs when our system attempts to validate documents for this user cohort, leading to downstream failures in our refund initiation workflow.\n\nTechnically, here's what's happening:\n1.  Our internal refund-processing service fails to get a successful KYC validation before calling Flipkart's `/v2/refunds/initiate` endpoint.\n2.  This prevents us from obtaining a valid `refund_id` from Flipkart, but our internal retry logic incorrectly marks the transaction for settlement reconciliation.\n3.  This creates thousands of 'ghost' refund entries in our T+2 settlement projection, which naturally don't exist in Flipkart's actual settlement file, causing the mismatch.\n\nLooking at our Grafana metrics, the P99 latency for the KYC validation endpoint has jumped from our 450ms baseline to nearly 1.9s, with an error rate peaking at 4.1%. This has impacted approximately 15,000 refund attempts over the past 36 hours. The Kubernetes pods for the KYC service are scaling up to handle the retries, but it's just amplifying the failure rate, not resolving it.\n\nThis is becoming a bit urgent, not just for reconciliation, but for compliance. The lack of a clear success/failure status for these refunds is creating messy audit trails, which could be an issue for our next RBI audit cycle. The logic for handling such edge cases was discussed previously in the thread from a few weeks back (email#5be432607c354cc1).\n\nAction Items & Next Steps:\n\n*   **Immediate Action:** I've updated JIRA PAY-7314 with these technical logs and a detailed failure analysis. I've also slightly tweaked the alerting thresholds on the KYC service to reduce noise for the on-call SREs.\n*   **Backend Team:** We need to prioritize implementing a circuit breaker. If the KYC service returns this specific `422` error, the refund process should halt and move the transaction to a manual review queue instead of retrying indefinitely. This will stop the bleeding.\n*   **Flipkart Inquiry:** Could you or the product team please raise a high-priority ticket with Flipkart's technical team? We need to know if they've recently deployed a change to their risk engine or KYC logic that would explain this sudden shift in behavior. The timing feels too coincidental to be an internal-only issue.\n\nLet's try to get a sync-up call with the Flipkart team by EOD tomorrow to resolve this. The financial impact of the discrepancy is growing.\n\nThanks,\nArjun"],"timestamp":1757915760000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"c68a79e53462425a","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"38d30119b2854bf7","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

This has become a significant operational bottleneck.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show that our refund reconciliation service is seeing error rates spike to nearly 5.0% during the nightly T+1 settlement window. This is entirely due to `HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)` responses from your `/v2/payments/refund/status` endpoint. While our sustained TPS is steady at ~150, well below the documented limit, the throttling seems to be triggered by brief, high-volume bursts inherent to our batch processing jobs running on our Kubernetes infrastructure. The p99 latency for successful requests remains healthy at ~250ms, but the failed requests are causing a cascade of reconciliation failures.\n\nThe business impact is growing. The discrepancy backlog is now affecting our ability to adhere to RBI's refund TAT guidelines, which is a major compliance concern. Our audit logs, required for SOC 2 compliance, are becoming cluttered with reconciliation retries and failures. We are tracking the resolution internally via JIRA PAY-7836.\n\nFor a short-term fix, could your team please investigate the burst limit configuration for our OAuth 2.0 client ID and consider an immediate, temporary increase? We believe this will unblock our settlement pipeline. Long-term, as I mentioned in our previous discussion (ref: email#5be432607c354cc1), we strongly recommend exploring a bulk status API or a webhook-based notification system. Polling at this scale is inefficient and brittle.\n\nCan you please provide an ETA for the investigation into the rate limits? We need to get this resolved before the next settlement cycle to avoid compounding the issue.\n\nAppreciate your urgent help on this.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjali Patel"],"timestamp":1757915820000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@flipkart.com"],"cc":["priya.s@juspay.in","payments-eng@flipkart.com","settlements-team@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"9ecbbc4c80f34402","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"45949822e8b64e4f","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

Your findings on the routing logic misconfiguration align with what I'm seeing from a compliance and risk standpoint. This cross-border payment routing error has some significant regulatory implications we need to address urgently.\n\nI've spent the morning digging through Kibana logs for the incident window, specifically filtering for `merchant_id:flipkart` and `event_type:refund_settlement_failure`. The pattern is quite clear: our settlement orchestrator was incorrectly routing these refunds through an international gateway, causing Flipkart's settlement API to reject them with `ERROR_CODE: 422_INVALID_CURRENCY_CODE`. The volume is concerning – we’re looking at approximately 15,000 transactions that failed settlement.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is a major red flag. These failed transactions are not being captured in our automated SAR (Suspicious Activity Reporting) pre-screening and are creating a discrepancy in the T+1 settlement report for our partner bank. This directly impacts our adherence to RBI's guidelines on payment settlements and could be flagged in our next SOC 2 audit. The core issue seems to be the new routing rules engine deployed last Tuesday, as referenced in the initial report (email#5be432607c354cc1).\n\nThe good news is that our OAuth 2.0 authentication flow with Flipkart seems stable, and JWT token validation is passing, so the issue is isolated post-auth. The Grafana dashboard \"Flipkart-Settlement-Performance\" confirms this, showing our P99 latency for the `/v2/refunds/settle` endpoint spiking to over 2.5s before timing out, and the error rate jumping from a baseline of 0.2% to 4.5%.\n\nI've attached my detailed findings to JIRA PAY-9660 and linked the raw data export (file#49a3d287719c4892) for the engineering team.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Aditya):** Can you confirm that the proposed hotfix specifically forces the currency code to 'INR' for all domestic Flipkart refunds? We also need to ensure the fix adds enhanced audit logging for the routing decision logic itself, capturing the `rule_id` and `selected_gateway`. This is critical for future audit trails.\n2.  **Compliance (Myself):** I will begin the manual reconciliation process for the impacted transactions and prepare a draft of the internal incident report for the risk committee.\n\nMy main concern is getting this resolved before our weekly regulatory reporting deadline on Friday. Could we schedule a quick 15-minute call tomorrow morning to align on the deployment plan for the fix to the staging environment? We'll need to coordinate with Flipkart to get their sign-off for re-processing the failed batch.\n\nThis is our top priority for the week. Let's get this sorted.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":1757915820000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","payments-eng@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"38d30119b2854bf7","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"534fca6aff044e8c","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

It was crucial for our investigation.\n\nOur engineering and finance teams have completed a root cause analysis for the settlement discrepancy highlighted in Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9. We've pinpointed the issue to a misconfiguration in our payment routing logic for specific cross-border transactions.\n\n**Technical Root Cause:**\nThe issue originated in our settlement orchestrator service. A recently deployed routing rule change inadvertently caused refund requests for transactions made with certain international BINs to be processed as domestic refunds. This led to an incorrect currency and fee calculation, resulting in the T+2 settlement mismatches you reported. Our Kibana logs confirm this, showing a spike in `error.code:INVALID_COUNTRY_CODE` for the refund processing workflow, which was being masked by a downstream retry mechanism. We were seeing P99 latencies on the `/v1/settlement/process` endpoint jump from our usual ~450ms to nearly 2.2s for the affected batch.\n\n**Impact Analysis:**\nBased on the transaction list you provided and our internal Grafana dashboards, we've identified 1,428 refund transactions processed between Tuesday and Wednesday that were impacted. The total discrepancy amounts to ₹1,84,350. This is a significant variance, and frankly, it's a bit frustrating that our alerting thresholds didn't catch this specific edge case sooner. We're tuning them now to prevent a recurrence.\n\n**Resolution and Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Hotfix (Completed):** Our SRE team has already rolled back the problematic configuration in the production environment. All new refund requests are now being routed correctly. We're monitoring the settlement dashboard closely, and error rates have returned to the baseline of <0.1%.\n2.  **Reconciliation (In Progress):** Our finance team is conducting a manual reconciliation of the 1,428 affected transactions. We are using the data from file#49a3d287719c4892 as the source of truth. We will process a bulk credit adjustment to cover the shortfall in the next settlement cycle, scheduled for tomorrow, EOD.\n3.  **Permanent Fix (JIRA PAY-2537):** To prevent this from ever happening again, we're implementing a stricter validation layer at the API gateway level. Any refund request with a cross-border `payment_context` will now require an explicit `merchant_country_code` field, which will be cross-referenced before hitting the settlement orchestrator. This work is being tracked under JIRA PAY-2537 and is slated for our next sprint release. This also aligns with the discussion we had in the context of email#5be432607c354cc1 regarding PCI DSS 4.0 compliance.\n\nI've attached a preliminary report of the affected transaction IDs for your team's verification. Please let me know if you foresee any issues with the proposed bulk credit adjustment.\n\nWe take these discrepancies very seriously, especially given the RBI compliance context for cross-border payments. I'd like to schedule a brief 15-minute call early next week to confirm resolution and walk through the preventative measures in PAY-2537.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiddharth Nair\nVendor Success Manager\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757915880000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@flipkart.com","finance.ops@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"45949822e8b64e4f","refType":"email"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"5be432607c354cc1","refType":"email"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d16588f104e34fc4","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"48bd79771eda4400","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"d2b5f4bf83d54fa9","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"c285e1d3c27047c1","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"b57d0671f7034a2e","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"729f1929f23e407f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"323ec93b3da7493b","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6b7bc35daa424054","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"8569cf13c3be4fe7","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"e1caed07fedc4efb","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"526bb74fb38342f2","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"ea7aec473db243c6","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"37f5d06278bc4d52","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"f413806584b948ef","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"6078a2f36dfc43a5","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"3c1330285b4b444f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"df495f1ab7c94519","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"08b5691108d44069","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"846362236c4b4b50","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"988482b7c58f464f","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"a543f99240f24320","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"79a2c1ed983f4850","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"756bdee9b45f483f","refType":"event"}]}}

The new fraud model (v2.3) deployed yesterday for Flipkart refunds is causing a significant spike in false positives. Our overnight Euler ledger reconciliation job failed, flagging a large number of discrepancies, and the manual review queue is completely backed up. We need to decide on a course of action ASAP.\n\nI've linked the Grafana dashboard in the invite. Post-deployment of `deploy-id-fde-v2.3`, we saw transactions with `errorCode: FRD_401_HIGH_RISK` jump from a baseline of ~0.5% to 3.8% specifically for the Flipkart-refund processor. This seems to be the root cause. Kibana logs for the affected `transaction_ids` show the model is assigning abnormally high risk scores based on criteria that weren't an issue in v2.2. Rohan, maybe you can shed some light on this during the call?\n\nMy primary proposal is an immediate, temporary rollback. I have already staged a job to toggle the feature flag `FLIPKART_FRAUD_MODEL_V2_3_ENABLED` to `false`, which will revert us to the stable v2.2 model. This should bring the false positive rate back to baseline within minutes and unblock the settlement process. The main agenda for this meeting is to get alignment on this action and define next steps.\n\nProposed Agenda:\n1. Quick confirmation of the impact analysis.\n2. GO/NO-GO decision on the immediate rollback to v2.2.\n3. Assign owner for deep-dive RCA on the v2.3 model's behavior.\n4.

Thanks for the quick debugging on Slack. It looks like we've confirmed the root cause is the OAuth token refresh mechanism in our `auth-service-v2` failing intermittently under specific load conditions, leading to `401 Unauthorized` errors when the `settlement-reconciliation-job` calls Flipkart's `/refund/status` API.\n\nOur Grafana dashboard (link attached in Confluence) clearly shows a correlation between the spike in 401s and the timing of the settlement file discrepancies. The current logic has a race condition where a token can expire just before the refresh cycle is triggered, especially during peak batch processing. This is causing ~1.5% of refund status checks to fail, which directly impacts our Euler ledger reconciliation accuracy.\n\nProposed Agenda:\n1.  **Confirm RCA:** Quick final validation of the race condition theory. (5 mins)\n2.  **Solution Deep-Dive:** Discuss two proposed hotfixes:\n    a) Proactive Refresh: Implement a scheduler to refresh the token 5 mins *before* its official expiry.\n    b) Resilient Retry with new token: Enhance the retry logic in the settlement job to explicitly request a new token on a 401 error, instead of a simple backoff.\n3.  **Decision & Ownership:** Agree on the path forward, considering implementation effort vs. long-term stability. Assign owners for the code change (PR), QA, and deployment.\n4.  **Deployment & Rollback:** Define the deployment plan (canary vs. full) and criteria for a potential rollback.\n\nGoal is to leave this meeting with a concrete action plan and ETAs documented in PAY-6982. Rishi (Flipkart), can you confirm if there are any rate limits on your end for token generation that we should be aware of for option 2b?

The goal here is to agree on the root cause and lock down immediate remediation steps for the Flipkart refund settlement issue. Please review the linked Confluence page for a summary of the investigation so far.\n\nOur analysis points to a misconfiguration in the cross-border payment routing rules, deployed with ID `d-gama789b`, which incorrectly excluded a set of international BINs. The Kibana dashboard 'Refund_Processor_Errors' confirms a spike in `ERR_ROUTING_NO_VALID_PROCESSOR` codes starting right after the deployment. This has impacted approximately 1.2% of Flipkart's cross-border refunds over the last 72 hours, resulting in the ~₹45 Lakhs discrepancy Vikram’s team flagged in the Euler ledger reconciliation reports.\n\nProposed next steps for discussion and sign-off:\n1.  **Immediate Hotfix:** Rahul V. to revert the specific routing rule configmap in the payment-orchestration-service. We need a PR for this within the next 2 hours for immediate peer review and deployment. ETA for production fix: EOD Today.\n2.  **Manual Reconciliation:** Vikram R. and Rohan G. (Flipkart) to collaborate on a manual settlement file for the failed refunds. Vikram, can you provide an ETA for when we can expect the final discrepancy report to share with Flipkart's finance team?\n3.  **Preventative Action:** Priya S. to create a follow-up story for implementing stricter schema validation on our routing configuration pipeline. This should prevent similar typos or logical errors in the future. We can't have this happen again.\n4.  **Compliance Review:** Anjali D. to provide a quick review of the manual reconciliation process to ensure it aligns with our reporting obligations. A simple sign-off on the Confluence page will suffice.\n\nLet's get alignment on this so we can execute quickly. I will be updating the JIRA ticket with our decisions and owners post-call.","status":"confirmed","createdAt":1757916000000,"updatedAt":1757916000000,"app":"google-calendar","entity":"event","creator":{"displayName":"Arjun Mehta","email":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in"},"startTime":1757916900000,"endTime":1757920500000,"joiningLink":"https://meet.google.com/xyz-abcd-pqr","permissions":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","rahul.verma@juspay.in","anjali.desai@juspay.in","vikram.rao@juspay.in","rohan.gupta@flipkart.com","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"PAY-1414","refType":"jira"},{"refId":"6f0665214b2044c0","refType":"slack"},{"refId":"49a3d287719c4892","refType":"file"},{"refId":"92ed468b2e834377","refType":"file"}]}}

This correlates directly with the ongoing data sync process for the Oracle-to-Postgres core banking system (CBS) migration. The `settlement-processor` service is experiencing connection timeouts to the legacy Oracle DB, evidenced by a surge in `ORA-12170: TNS:Connect timeout occurred` errors logged in Splunk. The current JDBC connection pool, configured with `max_connections=50` via our Spring Boot application.yml, is being fully exhausted as threads are blocked on I/O wait, preventing the timely generation of the final settlement file for Flipkart.","The root cause is the synchronous, single-threaded nature of the legacy CBS query module within our batch processor. It executes a series of complex joins to reconcile refund statuses against payment captures, a process that is now contending for resources with the migration's high-volume read operations. This resource contention is causing a significant lag in the `flipkart_refund_ack` Kafka topic, with the consumer group lag exceeding our 5000-message alert threshold as seen in the Grafana dashboard. Consequently, settlement files are being delivered to Flipkart's SFTP server 45-60 minutes past the agreed SLA, leading to reconciliation mismatches on their end.","Immediate mitigation involves isolating the settlement workload. I recommend deploying a dedicated read-replica of the legacy Oracle DB, accessible only by the `refund-settlement-batch` service, and increasing its connection pool to `max_connections=100`. For a permanent fix, we must refactor the batch job. The reconciliation logic should be decoupled by creating a new microservice that subscribes to the CBS change data capture (CDC) streams (via Debezium) and populates a denormalized view in our operational PostgreSQL cluster. The settlement job will then query this pre-aggregated, low-latency data source, eliminating the direct dependency on the live, high-contention CBS during the critical settlement window."],"owner":"Arjun Mehta","ownerEmail":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","photoLink":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/photo8","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arjun.mehta@juspay.in","tech-leads@juspay.in","product-team@juspay.in","compliance@juspay.in","arshith.balaraju@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"application/json","createdAt":1757917380000,"updatedAt":1757917380000,"refs":[{"refId":"318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9","refType":"work"},{"refId":"f113a2b0e97d403c","refType":"event"}]}}
