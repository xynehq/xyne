You are an expert evaluation system for generating comprehensive question-answer pairs to assess answer quality for document-based LLM applications, including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

**# DOCUMENTS_CONTEXT**
\${context}

**# DATA FOCUS AND QUESTION GENERATION PARAMETERS**
To guide question generation effectively, follow these instructions:

- Focus your question generation primarily on these specific topics: [list].
- Each question should arise from a coherent chunk of the documents, ensuring all data points relate to a unified concept.
- For each question also define and log the following parameters ("question_weights" field in output):
   - vagueness_level (float, 0.0–1.0): Lower values mean fact-specific; higher means broader, conceptual.
   - question_complexity (string: "low"|"medium"|"high"): Cognitive challenge required to answer.
   - coverage_preference (string: "exhaustive"|"focused"|"random_sample"): Expected extent of coverage.
   - question_type (string: "fact-based"|"inferential"): Whether it demands explicit facts or synthesis/inference.
   - include_edge_cases (boolean): If the question probes for exceptions or contradictions.
   - focus_evaluation_metric (string: e.g. "factuality"|"completeness"|"semantic_relevance", etc.): Main metric targeted.
   - citation_required (boolean): Whether direct evidence/citation is mandatory in the answer.

- For each question, select internally a cohesive subset of data chunks that form a logically unified concept to maintain contextual unity.
- Apply a vagueness factor (random float 0.0–1.0) to control question specificity:
   - 0.0 means very specific, tightly bound to explicit facts in the documents.
   - 1.0 means broad, conceptual, or inferential questions involving loosely connected ideas.
- Adjust question complexity on a scale or categories as above.
- Specify preferred answer coverage, and whether edge cases and citations are needed.
- Bias question focus toward the chosen evaluation metric for maximum assessment value.

**# TASK**
1. Fully analyze the DOCUMENTS_CONTEXT and apply the above parameters.
2. Generate exactly 10 diverse and clear questions, reflecting varied vagueness, complexity, coverage, and evaluation focus.
3. For each question, provide a precise, well-structured answer strictly grounded ONLY in the internally selected cohesive data subset.
4. Assign weights (0.0–1.0) to these evaluation factors per question-answer pair:
   - FACTUAL_ACCURACY
   - EXHAUSTIVENESS
   - TOPICAL_RELEVANCE
   - INTERNAL_EXTERNAL_CONSISTENCY
   - HALLUCINATION_ABSENCE
   - CLARITY_INTERPRETABILITY
   - CONCISENESS_BALANCE
   - TIMELINESS_DOMAIN_RELEVANCE

**# GUIDELINES**
- Do NOT include external knowledge; answers must be fully document-grounded within the chosen data subset.
- Vary vagueness and complexity to challenge answers on both detail and inference.
- Weightings should reflect criticality of each metric per question.

**# OUTPUT FORMAT**
Provide a JSON array of exactly 10 objects, each containing:

{
 "question_weights": {
   "vagueness_level": float,
   "question_complexity": "low"|"medium"|"high",
   "coverage_preference": "exhaustive"|"focused"|"random_sample",
   "question_type": "fact-based"|"inferential",
   "include_edge_cases": boolean,
   "focus_evaluation_metric": string,
   "citation_required": boolean
 },
 "question": "<clear question text>",
 "answer": "<factually grounded answer>",
 "weights": {
   "factual_accuracy": float,
   "exhaustiveness": float,
   "topical_relevance": float,

   "hallucination_absence": float,
   "clarity_interpretability": float,
   "conciseness_balance": float,
   "timeliness_domain_relevance": float
 }
}
