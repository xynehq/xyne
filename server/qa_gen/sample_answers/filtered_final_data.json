Specifically, the MandateVelocityScorer-v2 model is incorrectly flagging legitimate mandate requests, leading to a 12% increase in transaction drops with the internal error code FRM-802: High-Velocity Mandate. This directly correlates with a drop in our mandate setup success rate from a baseline of 94% to 82% for high-volume merchants, a trend clearly visible in our Grafana dashboard 'upi-mandate-performance'.","The root cause appears to be an overly sensitive `vpa_velocity_threshold` within the model's configuration, which fails to properly account for legitimate bulk mandate creation scenarios such as subscription sign-up promotions. Additionally, the model's feature weighting for `device_fingerprint_entropy` seems disproportionately high, penalizing users who switch networks or utilize privacy-enhancing tools. These parameters are currently being read from our central Consul config store and are applied in real-time to the `upi_mandate_events` Kafka stream, causing immediate, widespread impact.","As an immediate containment strategy, we must deploy a hotfix to adjust the FRM-802 trigger threshold from a score of 0.85 to a more lenient 0.95. This should mitigate the acute customer impact. Concurrently, the data science team must initiate a retraining cycle for MandateVelocityScorer-v2, leveraging the incorrectly flagged transaction IDs from the past 48 hours (logged in our Elasticsearch cluster under the 'fraud_engine_logs' index) as a negative dataset. We will also prioritize the development of a shadow A/B testing framework to evaluate a new model version, v2.1, against the production model without affecting live traffic."],"owner":"Rohit Sharma","ownerEmail":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","photoLink":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/photo9","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","rohit.sharma@juspay.in","tech-leads@juspay.in","product-team@juspay.in","compliance@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"application/json","createdAt":1757910600000,"updatedAt":1757910600000}},

I've been investigating the latency spike in the real-time risk scoring engine for the UPI Mandate service, and it's definitely a bit concerning.\n\nBuilding on the preliminary analysis from file b1ced9640b604a7f, I can confirm we saw a major degradation. The event started around 15:10 IST. Our Grafana dashboards showed the p99 latency for the `/mandate/score-transaction` endpoint jumping from a baseline of ~210ms to a sustained 1.9s for about 15 minutes. This is well outside our 300ms SLA for this service and directly impacts our compliance with RBI's real-time processing guidelines.\n\nDrilling down with Kibana, the issue doesn't appear to be related to infrastructure resource exhaustion. CPU and memory utilization on the Kubernetes pods for the scoring service hovered around 70%, which is high but within operational limits. Instead, the logs point towards a bottleneck in our OAuth 2.0 token introspection flow. It seems the authentication service itself was slow to respond when validating the JWT tokens for these specific mandate creation requests. The error rate fortunately held steady at 0.15%, so we didn't drop transactions, but the added latency is unacceptable.\n\nAs a temporary mitigation, I’ve vertically scaled the authentication service pods, which has brought the p99 latency back down to around 400ms. It’s an improvement, but not a root cause fix. My primary hypothesis is a potential database connection pool exhaustion within the auth service, triggered by a pattern of requests specific to the new mandate flow.\n\nHere are the next steps:\n\n1.  **Immediate Action:** I will continue to monitor the service closely and keep the scaled-up resources in place to ensure stability for the rest of the day.\n2.  **Investigation:** I am initiating a deeper dive into the auth service's database query performance and connection handling. I'll be working with Priya from the database team on this. All findings will be tracked in JIRA PAY-4155.\n3.  **Long-term Fix:** We may need to implement a dedicated caching layer for token introspection or optimize the database queries being made by the auth service. This will be my priority for tomorrow.\n\nI’ll have a more comprehensive update with a root cause analysis by tomorrow morning.

I've been investigating from a compliance standpoint, and I'm afraid the situation is more critical than we initially thought.\n\nMy analysis of the Kibana logs from 14:15-15:00 IST today confirms a significant cross-border payment routing misconfiguration related to the UPI Mandate work (Work ID 452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2). We've identified approximately 2,150 domestic UPI transactions (`country_code: 'IN'`) that were incorrectly routed through our international payment gateway instead of the designated NPCI endpoint. This is a direct and serious breach of RBI's FEMA guidelines governing cross-border payments.\n\nThe preliminary analysis from `file#b1ced9640b604a7f` suggests that a faulty JWT claim within the OAuth 2.0 flow is the likely culprit, failing to correctly differentiate domestic vs. international mandates. This not only impacts our settlement reconciliation but also creates a significant regulatory exposure that requires immediate action and reporting. The audit trail for these transactions is now non-compliant.\n\nI have created JIRA PAY-3503 to track this as a P0 incident. We need to execute the following actions immediately:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Your team):** Initiate an immediate rollback of the problematic routing configuration deployed this afternoon. We cannot afford to have another transaction misrouted. Please confirm as soon as the rollback is complete.\n2.  **Engineering (Your team):** Conduct a full Root Cause Analysis (RCA).

Building on your findings in email b0bc09865e2f4193 regarding the cross-border routing anomalies, my team has confirmed the operational impact.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show a concerning spike in error code `U69` (Transaction not permitted by law/regulation) for international UPI Mandate transactions. The failure rate has jumped from our baseline of 0.2% to 4.8% in the last 6 hours, affecting roughly 20k transactions. From a risk perspective, this is a critical issue as it suggests a potential breach of our cross-border payment routing protocol, which has direct implications for RBI compliance.\n\nAs documented in JIRA PAY-9952, the root cause appears to be a misconfiguration in the Kubernetes deployment of our `upi-router-service`. The Kibana logs clearly show that the service is failing to initiate the required OAuth 2.0 flow and generate a valid JWT token for non-INR transactions, causing them to be rejected by the NPCI gateway. This bypasses the security controls we established for this flow, as specified in the initial spec (see analysis from file#b1ced9640b604a7f).\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n1.  **SRE Team:** Please prioritize the rollback of the `upi-router-service` to the last known stable version. The goal is to have this deployed to production within the next 90 minutes to mitigate further transaction failures.\n2.  **Dev Team (Priya):** Could you please investigate why our CI/CD pipeline's automated testing didn't catch this configuration error?

Building on that, the business impact is becoming a bit more severe than we initially thought, and I need to escalate the priority on this.\n\nThe false positive rate from our new fraud detection model for the UPI Mandate flow has jumped to an alarming 4.2% over the last 12 hours. Our Grafana dashboard (Payments Errors) shows a direct correlation with mandate creation failures, dropping our overall success rate from 98.5% to around 94.3%. For context, our acceptable threshold for false positives is below 1.0%, so this is causing significant customer friction and is a clear deviation from the performance metrics outlined in the project plan for Work ID 452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2.\n\nLooking at the Kibana logs, the issue seems to be concentrated at the pre-authorization stage of the `/v2/mandate/create` endpoint. The model appears overly sensitive to transaction velocity from newer device fingerprints, which is a common pattern for legitimate users setting up new mandates. This behavior seems inconsistent with the risk profile we defined in the initial spec (Doc#b1ced9640b604a7f).\n\nThis isn't just a technical metric; it's translating to a higher number of support tickets and complaints from several key merchant accounts who rely on recurring payments. We need to act quickly to avoid damaging these relationships and ensure we remain compliant with RBI's guidelines on customer experience without compromising on security.\n\nI’ve documented the core issue in JIRA PAY-3024. Here’s what I propose as immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Partial Rollback:** Can we deploy a canary release that routes ~25% of the mandate creation traffic back to the previous, more stable version of the fraud model? This would help us confirm if the new model is the root cause while mitigating some of the immediate business impact.\n2.  **Model Re-evaluation:** I need your team to urgently review the feature weights in the current model. The parameters causing this over-aggressiveness need to be identified and tuned. What's the feasibility of pushing a hotfix within the next 24-48 hours?\n\nLet’s set up a quick sync for tomorrow morning with Data Science to review the findings and agree on a path forward. I'm a bit concerned about meeting our Q3 goals for mandate adoption if this continues.\n\nLet me know your thoughts.\n\nThanks,\n\nRohit"],"timestamp":1757913120000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on the data points from your side and our internal investigation outlined in file 5b1d3e49f973459e, we've managed to isolate the root cause of the recent refund settlement discrepancies.\n\nSince your core banking system migration last Tuesday, we're observing a significant performance bottleneck that is directly impacting our automated reconciliation process. Our Grafana dashboards for payment operations are showing that the p99 latency on your primary refund status API endpoint is spiking from a stable baseline of ~400ms to over 2,500ms. These spikes correlate directly with our nightly settlement batch processing window.\n\nThis latency increase is causing API timeouts on our end, resulting in a 3.8% error rate for refund status checks. As of this morning, this has led to a backlog of over 14,500 refunds that our system couldn't automatically reconcile. We've been tracking this under JIRA PAY-6691. Our Kibana logs are filled with `ReadTimeoutException` errors pointing to your refund service endpoint. We've already ruled out any issues on our side related to our OAuth 2.0 token exchange or network connectivity; our other API integrations with you remain healthy with latency well within the 150ms SLA.\n\nThe main concern here is the direct impact on our ability to meet the T+1 settlement timeline, which carries significant compliance risk under current RBI guidelines. The manual effort required to clear this backlog is becoming unsustainable for my team.\n\nAs a potential path forward, could your team investigate the performance of the service layer that interacts with your new core banking system? It seems the synchronous nature of the API call is the primary issue. In the long run, transitioning to an asynchronous callback model for final refund statuses would be ideal, as it would decouple our systems from your internal processing latencies.\n\nFor immediate action, could you please:\n1.

We've dug deeper into the refund settlement discrepancy for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9, and our findings point to a critical routing configuration error.\n\nOur team has traced the issue in Kibana to a specific failure pattern with cross-border transactions. It seems that when a refund is initiated for a transaction with a non-INR currency code, your call to our `/v1/refunds/initiate` endpoint is intermittently misrouted, leading to a `502 Bad Gateway` on your end. The main problem is that our `/v2/settlement/reconcile` API is not receiving the failure data, so these refunds are effectively lost in the settlement file, creating a growing discrepancy.\n\nLooking at our Grafana metrics, the refund failure rate for these international payments has jumped to ~1.3%, impacting roughly 3,800 transactions over the past 48 hours. This translates to a settlement gap of approximately ₹1.9M. This is obviously a pressing issue, not just financially, but also from a compliance perspective. We're running up against RBI's T+1 settlement guidelines, and the lack of a clear audit trail for these failures is a red flag for our SOC 2 compliance.\n\nI've centralized all our findings, including detailed logs and affected transaction IDs, in JIRA ticket PAY-9329.

Regarding the reconciliation gaps you highlighted in email 7040d4d69f0a4a0f, I've completed an initial investigation into the multi-currency settlement process for Flipkart refunds.\n\nThe root cause appears to be linked to how our settlement-batch-processor service handles forex rate lookups for non-INR transactions, which is causing the discrepancies noted in JIRA PAY-5349. We've correlated this with our Kibana logs, which show intermittent API connection timeouts to our forex data provider during the nightly T+1 settlement window (approx. 01:00 - 03:00 IST). The P99 latency for this external endpoint is spiking above our 2000ms service timeout, leading the job to fall back on a potentially stale rate from our Redis cache. The error rate for these specific calls is hitting nearly 4%, which is unacceptable.\n\nTo address this as part of Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9, I’ve deployed a candidate fix to our staging environment. This change implements a more robust retry logic with exponential backoff for the forex API calls and tightens the cache TTL to 10 minutes to align with RBI's guidelines on currency rate application, as detailed in file#5b1d3e49f973459e. The OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token management with Flipkart's refund APIs are performing within spec, showing consistent response times under 250ms and zero authentication failures.\n\nLast night's simulated run on the staging environment processed a test batch of 50,000 multi-currency refunds. The results are promising: the discrepancy value dropped from an average of 1.2% to less than 0.05%, well within our acceptable threshold. The updated process maintained an average throughput of 4,500 TPS without degrading the performance of other parallel settlement jobs. You can view the performance metrics on our 'Staging-Settlement-Health' Grafana dashboard.\n\nMy primary action item is to get your team's validation on the reconciliation report generated from this staging run.

Building on your points from email 4fbbd82a039f42cb, my team has completed a deeper analysis of the UPI refund settlement discrepancy, and the issue unfortunately persists.\n\nOur automated reconciliation engine has again flagged a shortfall in the T+1 settlement cycle for May 15th. We have identified 37 specific UPI refund transactions, amounting to a total of ₹48,350, that were confirmed as `REFUND_SUCCESSFUL` via your `/v1/refund/status` API but are conspicuously missing from the final settlement file (`FK_SETTLE_RFN_20240515_final.csv`) shared via SFTP. This is a recurring problem related to Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nFrom our side, we've verified the end-to-end flow. Our Kibana logs show successful `200 OK` responses for all corresponding status API calls, and the JWT tokens used in the OAuth 2.0 flow were correctly generated and accepted. The Grafana dashboard monitoring our NPCI gateway and your API endpoints shows no anomalous error rates or latency spikes; our p99 latency for the refund status API remained stable at ~350ms. The discrepancy seems to be originating downstream within Flipkart’s system, between the point of API confirmation and the batch process that generates the settlement report.\n\nThis is becoming a pressing operational and compliance concern. As you're aware, delays in refund credits beyond the stipulated T+2 timeline can attract scrutiny under RBI guidelines. I have updated the severity on JIRA PAY-5034 to reflect this urgency.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **Investigation:** Could your engineering team please investigate the root cause for these specific transactions failing to be included in the settlement file? We suspect a potential issue in the job that aggregates data for the final report.\n2.  **Data for Analysis:** My colleague, Aditya, has re-attached the detailed list of `juspay_order_id`s and corresponding bank RRNs in the spreadsheet `refund_discrepancy_may15.csv` (Reference: file#5b1d3e49f973459e) for your team to trace.\n\nWhile a manual settlement for the outstanding amount is a necessary short-term fix, we need a permanent resolution to this process gap. Can we schedule a 30-minute technical call tomorrow with your settlement and payments engineering leads to walk through the data flow?

Building on your last message (email 664b37f4b39e4498), I'm circling back with some urgency regarding the KYC automation failures we are still observing for high-risk customer segments. This issue, tracked under JIRA PAY-7425 for our Flipkart Refund Settlement work (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9), is now escalating into a significant compliance and operational concern.\n\nOur analysis shows that for a specific cohort of users flagged by our internal risk engine, the API calls to your `/v2/customer/kyc/status` endpoint are failing with a concerning frequency. Kibana logs point to a high volume of `KYC_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT` (Error Code: 4082) responses, exclusively for users whose profiles trigger our high-risk criteria. The P99 latency for these specific calls is spiking to over 2.5s, far exceeding the 99.9% SLA target of sub-800ms and the baseline of 450ms we see for standard profiles. The error rate has jumped from 0.1% to 4.8% for this segment.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is becoming critical. These failures necessitate manual intervention, which breaks the automated audit trail mandated by the RBI's Master Direction on KYC. It creates verifiable gaps in our audit logs, which is a major red flag for our imminent SOC 2 audit. Our Grafana dashboard for the Flipkart integration shows a 22% increase in manual refund processing queues, a workload that is not sustainable and directly correlates with these KYC API failures.\n\nAs discussed in the analysis from email e12c294e1c3940bf, our leading hypothesis is that your backend systems may be applying stricter rate-limiting or a different processing logic for KYC checks on profiles you also deem high-risk, causing our server-to-server calls to time out. We have re-validated our OAuth 2.0 token generation and the JWTs are well-formed; the auth flow is nominal.\n\nCould you please have your engineering team prioritize an investigation of the logs for the transaction IDs compiled in file#5b1d3e49f973459e? We need to understand if there is any differentiated throttling or de-prioritization happening for these KYC checks.\n\nGiven the regulatory pressure, we really need a definitive root cause analysis and a resolution plan by EOD tomorrow.

The issue stems from a cross-border payment routing configuration error, which is causing refund settlement failures during the T+2 cycle. I have to be honest, the compliance implications of this are making us a bit anxious, especially concerning RBI guidelines.\n\n**Technical Analysis & Findings:**\nWe've analyzed the Kibana logs for the transaction batch provided in `file#5b1d3e49f973459e`. The pattern is consistent: for refunds linked to original transactions made with international cards, the `refund.initiate` API call from Flipkart's end is missing the `is_international: true` flag in the payload. Our gateway relies on this specific flag to route the refund settlement through the correct international acquiring partner. Without it, the requests are incorrectly routed through our domestic UPI gateway, which then fails with an `Error Code: 5042 (Acquirer Mismatch)` during reconciliation.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show that the refund error rate for the cross-border BIN range has spiked to 3.8% over the past 48 hours, impacting about 1,500 transactions. This directly jeopardizes our ability to meet the strict settlement timelines mandated by RBI for cross-border funds, which is a major concern.\n\nThis entire issue is being tracked under JIRA PAY-6869 for end-to-end resolution.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation (Juspay):** Our finance team is already working on a manual reconciliation file for the failed settlements to prevent further delays, but this is not a scalable solution.\n\n2.  **Permanent Fix (Action on Flipkart):** We need your engineering team to urgently investigate and deploy a fix to ensure the `is_international` flag is correctly passed in the API payload for all cross-border transactions. This is critical for the long-term health and compliance of our automated settlement process.\n\nCould you please connect with your technical counterparts and provide an ETA for this fix? The backlog is growing, and we need to contain the compliance risk as quickly as possible.

Building on your analysis in email ec3595e5558a4cf0, I've investigated the root cause from an infrastructure and API perspective.\n\nOur monitoring confirms that we are being aggressively rate-limited by Flipkart's refund status API. Kibana logs are flooded with `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors from their `/refunds/v1/query` endpoint for the past 48 hours. Our Grafana dashboard shows our effective throughput for this specific job has been throttled to approximately 50-60 TPS, while our system is attempting to push over 250 TPS to clear the refund settlement file.\n\nThis has resulted in a significant processing delay, and our internal settlement queue now has a backlog of over 20,000 transactions. The P99 latency for the reconciliation service has consequently degraded from a healthy ~350ms to over 2.1s due to the constant failed requests and retries. While our Kubernetes deployment has scaled up the service pods to handle this, it's ineffective as the bottleneck is external. This is becoming a bit of a resource drain and is starting to trigger our high-latency alerts.\n\nThe primary concern here is the potential violation of our T+1 settlement SLA. Continued delays could create compliance and audit issues under RBI guidelines. This entire investigation is being tracked under JIRA PAY-5176 for the Flipkart Refund Settlement Discrepancy Resolution project (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9).\n\nHere are the proposed action items:\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation (Owner: Arjun Mehta):** I am deploying a hotfix to our staging environment to implement an exponential backoff with jitter for our retry logic against this specific Flipkart endpoint. This should reduce the pressure on their end and hopefully result in fewer `429s`. I aim to have this in production by EOD tomorrow, post-verification.\n\n2.  **Vendor Escalation (Owner: Business/Partnerships Team):** We need to urgently raise a formal request with our technical account manager at Flipkart to increase our API rate limit. Based on current and projected volumes, we require a minimum sustained throughput of 300 TPS. I've attached the analysis from file#5b1d3e49f973459e which supports this requirement.\n\nCould you please help facilitate the conversation with Flipkart?

Building on the analysis from your last email (c9099a114f3445b9), I've managed to isolate the root cause of the refund settlement discrepancies we're observing.\n\nThe issue appears to stem from our KYC automation process failing for specific high-risk customer segments, which directly impacts the refund lifecycle. This is the primary focus of Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of what we've found:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** Our internal KYC verification service, which is triggered for refunds associated with high-risk user profiles, is correctly flagging these accounts for manual review as per RBI guidelines. However, our refund settlement module is not designed to handle this intermediate `PENDING_MANUAL_REVIEW` state. It expects an immediate synchronous `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE` response from the KYC check.\n\n2.  **Technical Log Analysis:** I’ve been digging through the Kibana logs for our Kubernetes-deployed settlement service, focusing on the transaction IDs you shared in `file#5b1d3e49f973459e`. For each failed case, our KYC service logs show a `status: PENDING_MANUAL_REVIEW` with our internal error code `4028`. The downstream refund processor then times out after its 2.5s threshold and incorrectly marks the refund as failed in our system, while on Flipkart's side, it's likely still considered processing.\n\n3.  **Metric Correlation:** Our Grafana dashboard for refund processing shows a clear correlation. The error rate for our refund settlement API spikes from a baseline of 0.1% to nearly 4.5% whenever we process a batch containing a high concentration of these user segments. This directly corresponds to the `4028` error count in our logs.\n\n**Proposed Resolution & Action Items:**\n\n*   **Immediate Mitigation:** We are preparing a script to manually re-trigger the settlement for the affected transaction IDs once our compliance team gives the manual KYC approval. I’ll coordinate with them to clear the current backlog. I've linked this entire thread and the logs to our internal ticket, **JIRA PAY-2802**, for tracking.\n\n*   **Long-Term Fix:** We need to update our settlement orchestration logic to accommodate this asynchronous KYC flow. The plan is to introduce a `PENDING_VERIFICATION` state into the refund state machine. The system will then poll for the final KYC status. This is a significant change, and the engineering team is scoping the effort now.\n\n*   **Question for your team:** To make the long-term solution more robust and avoid continuous polling, would it be possible for Flipkart’s user service to provide a webhook callback to a Juspay endpoint once a manual KYC review is complete? A real-time notification would be far more efficient than a polling mechanism and would align better with our target P99 latency of under 300ms for such status updates. This was briefly touched upon in our previous discussion referenced in email `e12c294e1c3940bf`.\n\nWe're treating this with high priority due to the direct impact on the customer experience and our T+1 settlement SLA. Let me know your thoughts on the webhook possibility so we can finalize the architecture for the permanent fix.\n\nBest regards,\n\nArjun Mehta"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T10:16:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.singh@juspay.in","flipkart-integration@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["rohan.sharma@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on that, our team has managed to pinpoint the root cause of the ongoing settlement discrepancies we're tracking under Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nThe issue stems from an intermittent failure in the OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow for your refund status API. Our reconciliation service, which calls your API endpoint to verify refund states, is experiencing significant timeouts. Our investigation indicates that when our service attempts to use a JWT that has just expired, instead of an immediate `401 Unauthorized` response, your authorization server is taking an unusually long time to respond. \n\nLooking at our Grafana dashboards, the p99 latency for these specific API calls is spiking from a baseline of ~250ms to over 2.5 seconds. This is causing `ReadTimeoutException` errors on our client-side, which runs within a Kubernetes cluster. Our Kibana logs show a direct correlation between these timeouts and failed OAuth token refresh attempts. This has pushed the error rate for our reconciliation job to nearly 4.5%, a significant deviation from our sub-0.1% operational SLA.\n\nThe business impact is getting critical. We are unable to programmatically reconcile a growing number of refund transactions, which is creating a manual overhead and poses a compliance risk against the RBI's T+1 settlement guidelines. As of this morning, the unreconciled transaction count is approaching 7,000.\n\nWe have ruled out internal network latency or resource contention on our end. Our hypothesis is that there may be a performance issue on your authorization server's token validation logic. We are implementing the OAuth flow as defined in the documentation we received during onboarding (ref: email e12c294e1c3940bf).\n\nTo move forward, could your API platform team please investigate why requests with expired JWTs are resulting in a ~2.5s response time instead of an immediate rejection?

Building on your points in email 106bbe795e774749, our team has conducted a more detailed investigation into the API timeouts.\n\nThe root cause appears to be a systemic issue with the OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow, which is having a direct impact on our ability to process refunds. Our monitoring systems flagged this as a critical incident, and it's being tracked internally under JIRA PAY-2149.\n\nHere are our findings:\n\n1.  **API Performance Degradation:** Our Grafana dashboards showed a severe spike in p99 latency for the `/v1/refunds/settle` endpoint, increasing from our baseline of ~180ms to over 2.5s. This coincided with a 4.8% error rate, far exceeding our SLA threshold of 0.5%. These metrics were observed yesterday between 14:00 and 16:30 IST.\n\n2.  **Authentication Failures:** Correlating this with our Kibana logs, we've confirmed that each batch of `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors was preceded by a failed attempt to refresh the access token. Our system's requests to your `/oauth/token` endpoint are timing out after our standard 3-second connection timeout. Our client-side implementation is compliant with the flow detailed in Doc#f4a54fd229d1468b.\n\n3.  **Compliance and Reconciliation Risk:** From a compliance perspective, this is becoming a serious concern. The settlement failures are creating significant data discrepancies, which complicates our T+1 reconciliation process and puts us at risk of breaching RBI's refund processing TATs. The lack of a definitive success/failure response from the API during these timeouts also compromises the integrity of our audit logs, which is a key requirement for our SOC 2 compliance.\n\nGiven that our requests aren't even receiving an error response, we suspect a performance bottleneck or perhaps an unannounced rate limit on your authentication service. Could your team please urgently investigate the server-side application and load balancer logs for our client ID during the incident window?\n\nAs a clear action item, we need you to confirm if any changes were made to the token service and to analyze its performance under load. We have updated the list of impacted refund IDs in file#5b1d3e49f973459e for your cross-verification.\n\nLet's connect for a brief technical call tomorrow morning if the issue isn't resolved by EOD today.

Building on your message from yesterday (ref: email f4a54fd229d1468b), our SRE team has completed a detailed investigation into the recent latency spikes observed with the real-time risk scoring engine, which is a critical component of the Flipkart Refund Settlement process (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9).\n\nOur findings point towards a performance bottleneck on the Flipkart side. Here’s a summary of what we've observed:\n\n**Performance Metrics & Analysis:**\n*   **Latency Spikes:** Our Grafana monitoring (Dashboard: `FK-Refund-Performance`) shows that between 16:20 and 17:05 IST yesterday, the p99 latency for your risk scoring API endpoint surged from a baseline of ~250ms to intermittent peaks of up to 2.1s. This is well outside our operational SLA.\n*   **Internal Verification:** We have thoroughly audited our internal systems. Our Kubernetes pod resource utilization (CPU/Memory) was stable during the incident window. Network latency from our egress points to other external services remained nominal. Our OAuth 2.0 and JWT token validation layer also performed within its 50ms budget, so we can confidently rule out authentication overhead.\n*   **Log Correlation:** Digging into our Kibana logs, we can see the entire time delta is consumed between our API call initiation and the reception of your response. There are no connection timeouts or packet-level errors on our side, which isolates the delay to your service's processing time.\n\nBased on this data, our hypothesis is that the latency is originating from within your risk scoring service, possibly due to a resource-intensive database query under load or a cascading delay from a dependent microservice.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\nTo move this forward, could your engineering team please investigate the following on your end?\n\n1.  **Review Service Logs:** Analyze the application and system logs for your risk scoring engine corresponding to the timeframe of 16:20 - 17:05 IST yesterday.\n2.  **Database Query Performance:** Please check for any long-running or inefficient database queries triggered during this period. The list of `juspay_transaction_id`s from the affected window, which you can correlate, is attached in the previously shared `file#5b1d3e49f973459e`.\n3.  **Downstream Dependencies:** Verify the performance of any internal microservices that the risk engine relies upon for its scoring logic.\n\nWe've created JIRA PAY-8008 to track this issue formally. Given the potential impact on refund Turn-Around-Time (TAT), which is closely monitored under RBI guidelines, resolving this is a high priority for us. I'm a bit concerned about this reoccurring during the upcoming sale event.\n\nPlease let me know the ETA for your team's investigation.

That data was instrumental in helping us accelerate the investigation for the ongoing refund settlement discrepancy, tracked under JIRA PAY-8919.\n\nWe've completed the root cause analysis. The issue was traced back to a misconfiguration in our payment routing service that handles cross-border transactions. A new ruleset deployed yesterday incorrectly flagged a specific range of international card BINs as domestic, causing our system to route refund requests for these transactions to the incorrect settlement processor. This triggered the `INVALID_ROUTING_ID` error from your `/v2/refunds/initiate` endpoint, which we were able to correlate in our Kibana logs.\n\nOur Grafana monitoring (dashboard: `Payments-Volume`) shows a clear spike in 5xx errors on this endpoint to 4.2% between 14:30 and 16:00 IST yesterday, affecting approximately 1,250 refund transactions. This misrouting, while brief, posed a potential compliance risk concerning RBI's FEMA reporting, making its resolution our highest priority.\n\n**Resolution and Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Hotfix Deployed:** We deployed a hotfix at 17:45 IST yesterday to correct the BIN identification logic. The fix was validated against a sample of the failed transactions in our staging environment before being pushed to production. Post-deployment monitoring shows refund success rates have returned to the normal <0.1% error threshold.\n\n2.  **[Juspay] Re-initiation of Failed Refunds:** We are now initiating a batch job to re-process all 1,250 affected refunds. We anticipate this process will be completed within the next 2 hours.\n\n3.  **[Flipkart] Confirmation Request:** Could your team please confirm once this re-processed batch is visible in your settlement system? This will help us verify that the reconciliation is on track from your end.\n\n4.  **[Flipkart] Reconciliation File:** To formally close out this incident (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9) and the associated JIRA ticket, could you share the final reconciliation file for today's settlement (T+1) once the batch is processed?\n\nI’ve cc'd my manager, Aditya, to keep him in the loop.

My team and I have completed a root cause analysis, and we've identified a direct correlation between the refund settlement discrepancies and a specific failure in our automated KYC process for a subset of your customers.\n\nOur investigation, tracked under JIRA PAY-9997, reveals that the issue stems from API calls to your `/v2/customer/kyc/verify` endpoint. Specifically, for customers our internal risk engine flags as 'high-risk' (based on transaction velocity and value thresholds), our system attempts an enhanced, real-time KYC check before processing the refund. These API calls are consistently failing.\n\nLooking at our Kibana logs, we're seeing a high volume of `403 Forbidden` responses for these requests. Our Grafana dashboard shows the error rate for this specific endpoint spiking to over 15% during the refund processing window, a significant deviation from the usual <0.2% error rate. This is happening despite the OAuth 2.0 bearer token being valid and having the correct scopes, which we've cross-verified against the spec from our last integration sync.\n\nAs a direct result, our compliance module, which is built to adhere strictly to RBI's KYC and AML guidelines, is programmatically halting the refund settlement. Without a successful KYC validation, we cannot proceed with the fund transfer. This is the source of the discrepancy between our settlement report and yours.\n\nTo move forward, could your technical team please investigate the following on your end?\n\n1.  Are our requests to `/v2/customer/kyc/verify` for these specific user segments being blocked by a WAF rule or another security layer on your side?\n2.

Building on that, our team has completed a deeper dive into the ongoing Flipkart refund settlement discrepancy, and I need to flag this with some urgency from a compliance standpoint.\n\nOur investigation confirms that the root cause is a cross-border payment routing configuration error on your side. We're observing refund initiation requests for INR-denominated transactions being incorrectly routed to our EU-based cluster instead of the designated India cluster. This is causing significant reconciliation failures and, more critically, poses a compliance risk by processing domestic transactions outside the stipulated regulatory geography, which directly contravenes recent RBI guidelines on data localization and payment processing.\n\nHere are the technical specifics our team has gathered:\n\n1.  **Log Analysis:** Kibana logs show that refund API calls from your service IP range are intermittently hitting `api.eu.juspay.io/v2/orders/{order_id}/refunds`. These calls should be exclusively directed to `api.in.juspay.io`. The misrouted requests are failing our validation layer with error code `422_INVALID_CURRENCY_FOR_REGION` before they even reach the settlement system. I've attached a subset of these logs for your reference.\n\n2.  **Performance Impact:** Our Grafana dashboards show a direct correlation between these misrouted calls and latency spikes. The affected endpoint on the EU cluster is seeing p99 latencies of up to 2.1s, while our IN cluster maintains a healthy sub-350ms average. This routing issue is contributing to a 1.8% error rate on the overall refund processing flow, which is well above our 0.2% SLA threshold.\n\n3.  **Compliance & Reconciliation:** As a result of this routing error, approximately 3,400 refund transactions in the last 48 hours have failed to settle. This has created a backlog that requires manual intervention, delaying the T+1 settlement cycle. The attached reconciliation report (ref: file#5b1d3e49f973459e) details the affected `transaction_ids`. The entire issue is being tracked under JIRA PAY-8845.\n\nBased on the timeline discussed in email `e12c294e1c3940bf`, this appears to have started after your last production deployment. Our hypothesis is that a service discovery configuration or an ingress routing rule within your Kubernetes environment may have been incorrectly updated, leading to this traffic leakage.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Flipkart:** Could your payments engineering team please urgently review and correct the API endpoint configuration for your refund initiation service? All traffic for INR refunds must be directed to `api.in.juspay.io`.\n*   **Juspay:** Our team is standing by to support your investigation. Aditya's team can provide real-time log monitoring to confirm once the fix is deployed.\n\nGiven the compliance exposure and the direct impact on customer refunds, resolving this is our top priority for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.

The discrepancy appears to be exclusively for UPI refunds initiated on your platform post-18:00 IST. Our system, in alignment with NPCI clearing cycles, marks these transactions for a T+2 settlement. The report you shared (file#5b1d3e49f973459e), however, seems to account for these within the T+1 cycle, leading to the daily reconciliation gap.\n\nHere’s a snapshot of our findings from the last 48-hour cycle:\n\n*   **Data Source:** Our analysis is based on correlating Kibana logs (index: `prod-settlement-reco-*`) against the transaction IDs in your report.\n*   **Discrepancy Volume:** We've identified a consistent set of approximately 2,100 transactions per day that are being mismatched. This represents about 0.8% of the total daily refund volume but is causing significant manual overhead for our finance team.\n*   **Technical Root Cause (Hypothesis):** Our UPI gateway correctly flags transactions with a `refund_initiation_timestamp` after 18:00 IST for the next settlement day (T+2). We suspect Flipkart's reconciliation logic might be using a different cutoff time or timezone configuration, which classifies these transactions incorrectly as T+1. We've traced this behavior in our Grafana dashboards, which show a spike in reconciliation failures precisely in the batches processed after this cutoff.\n\nAll our technical findings and relevant log snippets have been consolidated in JIRA PAY-7262 for a more detailed audit trail.\n\nTo move forward, could your engineering team please investigate the following on your end?\n\n1.  **Confirm the settlement cutoff logic:** Could you verify the business rule and timezone applied in your system for bucketing UPI refunds into T+1 vs. T+2 settlement files?\n2.  **Review API data:** We are consistently populating the `expected_settlement_date` field in our `refunds/v2/status` API response. Could you confirm if your system is consuming this field as the primary source of truth for the settlement date? Our API is performing well within SLA, with a P99 latency of 180ms.\n\nResolving this is becoming a bit urgent, as the manual reconciliation effort is not scalable and introduces a risk of non-compliance with RBI's refund TAT guidelines. We need to get our automated reconciliation success rate back to our target of 99.95%.\n\nHappy to jump on a quick technical call tomorrow with the relevant engineers from your side to walk through the data.

Building on the initial analysis from Priya in email b27c8d2271284bb0, my team has completed a deeper investigation into the refund settlement discrepancies, and I wanted to share our findings for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nThe core issue stems from a data mismatch between the initial refund transaction currency and the final settlement currency reported in the daily files. Our `refund-settlement-processor` service, which runs on our production Kubernetes cluster, is flagging a growing number of errors that we're tracking under JIRA PAY-6536.\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\n1.  **API vs. Settlement File:** When a refund is initiated via your `POST /v1/refunds/initiate` endpoint, it correctly includes the transaction's original currency (e.g., USD, AED). However, the corresponding entry in the daily settlement report (referenced from `file#5b1d3e49f973459e`) is consolidated into INR without providing the original currency, amount, or the FX rate applied. This is causing our automated reconciliation logic to fail.\n\n2.  **Impact Metrics:** Looking at our Kibana logs for the `settlement-reconciliation` service, we're seeing a consistent `CURRENCY_MISMATCH` error for approximately 1.8% of total refund transactions. While this seems low, it translates to thousands of manual interventions daily, especially during peak sales where refund TPS can exceed 15k. Our Grafana dashboard (`Refunds-Recon-Primary`) shows a steady climb in the unresolved queue, which is becoming a significant operational overhead and is a compliance concern.\n\n3.  **Compliance & Security:** This lack of transparency in the settlement file could become a critical issue during our next SOC 2 audit and for RBI reporting, which requires clear lineage for all foreign currency transactions. Our current OAuth 2.0 flow with JWT token auth is secure, but the data integrity post-transaction is the weak link.\n\n**Proposed Solution & Next Steps:**\n\nTo resolve this permanently and optimize the process, we need a more robust way to reconcile multi-currency refunds. We've outlined two potential paths, and I've detailed the full technical specifications in our internal document, Doc#9240e5f20ea8439c.\n\n*   **Option A (Preferred):** Enhance your settlement API. Ideally, you could expose a new endpoint, something like `GET /v1/settlements/refund/{refund_id}`, which would return a JSON object with `original_currency`, `original_amount`, `settlement_currency`, `settlement_amount`, and `exchange_rate_applied`. This would allow for near real-time reconciliation and reduce our T+1 reconciliation latency, which currently averages around 850ms per batch.\n\n*   **Option B:** Modify the existing daily settlement file (`file#5b1d3e49f973459e`) to include these additional fields. While less efficient than an API, this would be a viable interim solution.\n\nOur backend services are flexible, and we can quickly adapt our `settlement-processor` to consume either of these formats. We've already scoped the work on our side and could have it ready for staging deployment within one sprint following the finalization of your API contract.\n\nCould your team please review these proposals and let us know which approach is more feasible from your end? We're keen to get this resolved to ensure a 99.95% automated reconciliation rate and maintain our compliance posture.\n\nLet's schedule a brief technical call for early next week to align on the path forward.\n\nBest regards,\n\nArjun Mehta"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T10:21:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["ravi.kumar@flipkart.com","flipkart.tech@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on the analysis from your last message (email 9240e5f20ea8439c), our team has completed a deep-dive into the refund settlement discrepancy under Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nOur investigation has confirmed that the root cause was a cross-border payment routing configuration error within our gateway. Between approximately 18:00 and 22:00 IST on Tuesday, a subset of international transactions were incorrectly routed through our domestic acquiring partner instead of the designated international payment processor. Kibana logs show these transactions originated from a specific European BIN range and were hitting the wrong processing endpoint, bypassing the necessary currency conversion and MDR logic.\n\nThis resulted in auth success but an immediate failure during the T+2 settlement reconciliation batch. The primary error code flagged by our system was `SETTLEMENT_CURRENCY_MISMATCH`. The financial impact is a reconciliation gap of approximately ₹3.8 Lakhs across 540 failed refund settlements. This is a bit of a headache, as this misrouting also creates a potential compliance deviation from RBI's guidelines for processing cross-border remittances, which we need to rectify immediately to maintain our SOC 2 compliance posture.\n\nTo address this, our engineering team has deployed a hotfix to our staging environment that corrects the routing rules in our Kubernetes configuration map. This ensures that transactions from the identified BINs are now correctly passed to the international processor via the appropriate OAuth 2.0 flow. Initial tests show latency is stable at ~850ms and the settlement file generation is accurate.\n\nAs discussed in our earlier conversation (ref: email e12c294e1c3940bf), we need your team's validation before promoting this to production.

The failure rate for this cohort has hit 12%, while the baseline for other segments remains below 0.5%.\n*   **Log Analysis:** Kibana logs confirm that for these failed refunds, Flipkart's KYC verification endpoint is consistently returning an error code: `KYC_VERIFICATION_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_DATA`. This is happening post-authentication; the OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT tokens are valid, ruling out an auth issue.\n*   **Business Impact:** This has so far impacted ~1,500 refunds, holding up a settlement value of approximately INR 2.3 Lakhs. The manual verification fallback is creating operational overhead and is not sustainable. More critically, it puts us at risk of breaching RBI's mandated timelines for customer refunds, which is a significant compliance concern tracked under JIRA PAY-4241.\n\nThe issue seems to stem from a data mismatch between the payload we're sending and what Flipkart's system now expects for users categorized under the high-risk profiles defined in file#5b1d3e49f973459e. It's possible their validation logic was updated recently.\n\nTo resolve this, I propose the following immediate actions:\n\n1.  **Flipkart Team:** Could you please investigate the `KYC_VERIFICATION_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_DATA` error from your side? We need the exact schema or data points that are failing validation so we can adjust our API calls.\n2.  **Aditya:** Could you have your team collate a few anonymized request and response payload examples for these failed transactions? We'll need them ready to share with Flipkart's engineers.\n3.  **My Action:** I will schedule a joint call with the Flipkart technical and compliance teams for tomorrow to sync on this. The lack of automated KYC for this segment is a major blocker for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nWe need to get this resolved quickly to prevent further financial discrepancies and ensure we remain compliant.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T10:23:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","finance.recon@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on the points you raised in your last email (ref: f04cb429d0d548d7), our team has dug deeper into the refund settlement discrepancies, and we have a strong lead.\n\nOur investigation points to a series of failures in our automated KYC verification service, specifically for customer profiles flagged as 'high-risk' by your system. This seems to be the root cause of the reconciliation issues we're tracking under Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nHere’s what we're seeing from our end:\n\n1.  **API Error Spike:** Our Kibana logs show a significant spike in `422 Unprocessable Entity` responses from our internal `/v2/kyc/verify` endpoint. This error pattern correlates directly with refund requests for the high-risk customer segment. We've attached a detailed log export to JIRA ticket PAY-4290.\n\n2.  **Performance Degradation:** The Grafana dashboard monitoring our payment infrastructure shows that for these specific cohorts, the P99 latency for the KYC service call is jumping from an average of 350ms to over 2.1s. This is causing timeouts in the upstream refund processing service, which has a stricter timeout threshold of 1.5s to maintain our overall settlement TPS.\n\n3.  **Impact on Settlement:** When a KYC check fails or times out, the refund transaction is automatically shunted from the standard T+1 settlement path to a manual review queue. This operational delay is the direct source of the discrepancy between Flipkart's refund initiation records and our final settlement reports, as analyzed in file#5b1d3e49f973459e.\n\nFrankly, this is becoming a bit of a concern. Beyond the immediate financial reconciliation headache, the resulting delay in processing these refunds puts us in a tricky position regarding RBI's mandated Turnaround Times (TAT). We need to get ahead of this quickly.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n*   **[Flipkart] Payload Analysis:** Could your team please re-examine the data structure in the API payloads for these high-risk customer profiles? We suspect there might be a subtle deviation from the API contract we established, perhaps in an optional field that our stricter validation schema is now catching. The original spec is in Doc#642f580106b646d4 for reference.\n\n*   **[Juspay] Resiliency Test:** Our engineering team (tracked in JIRA PAY-4290) is deploying a patch to our staging environment. This patch will introduce more granular error handling and temporarily relax a non-critical validation rule to test our hypothesis. We plan to run simulated transaction loads against it by EOD today.\n\n*   **[Joint] Debug Session:** Let's schedule a joint debug session for tomorrow at 11:00 AM IST to trace a few failed `juspay_txn_id`s from the latest batch. This will allow us to observe the OAuth flow and JWT token exchange in real-time. I will send out a calendar invite shortly.\n\nLet's sync up on the JIRA ticket with our findings. We're committed to getting this resolved before the next settlement cycle.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiddharth Nair"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T10:24:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@flipkart.com"],"cc":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","finops-alerts@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on that, I've finished the initial analysis for the Flipkart refund settlement discrepancies under Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9, and the issue seems to stem from our KYC automation workflow.\n\nSpecifically, we're seeing a high rate of KYC verification failures for customer segments flagged as 'high-risk'. Our system, in line with RBI's AML guidelines, triggers a re-verification step for these refunds by calling Flipkart’s `/v2/customer/kyc/check` endpoint. This is where the process is breaking down.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show the error rate for this specific API call has spiked from our usual baseline of 0.2% to approximately 4.5% over the last 72 hours. Tracing the requests in Kibana, we're consistently receiving a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response with the payload `{ \"error_code\": \"KYC_DATA_MISMATCH\", \"message\": \"Aadhaar validation failed for high-risk profile\" }`. This isn't an authentication problem; our OAuth 2.0 JWTs are being handled correctly. The issue is happening at the data validation layer.\n\nThis is creating a bit of a downstream mess, as these failed KYC checks are blocking the refunds from being processed, leading to the settlement file discrepancies we're trying to resolve. It's putting our T+1 settlement SLA at risk, and the issue is being tracked urgently under JIRA PAY-1054.\n\nMy current hypothesis, building on the analysis from email e12c294e1c3940bf, is a potential schema or validation rule change on your side for this customer segment, which is now misaligned with the API contract specified in `file#5b1d3e49f973459e`. \n\nCould you please have your technical team investigate if any recent changes were deployed to the `/v2/customer/kyc/check` endpoint or the underlying data model for these profiles? Confirming the current expected schema would be a great help.\n\nLet's try to sync up for a quick debugging call sometime tomorrow.

Building on your email 30cada38493f419d, we've correlated your findings with our internal monitoring for the Flipkart Refund Settlement Discrepancy Resolution (Work ID: 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9).\n\nOur investigation confirms that the performance bottleneck appears to be linked to your recent core banking system migration. We are seeing a direct impact on our refund reconciliation service, which is becoming a growing operational concern.\n\nHere’s a summary of what our systems are showing:\n\n*   **API Latency Spike:** Our Grafana dashboards are flagging a significant degradation in response times from your refund status API. The p99 latency has increased from our baseline of ~250ms to over 2.1s during peak reconciliation loads. This is causing cascading failures in our settlement process.\n*   **Elevated Error Rates:** We're observing a sustained error rate of ~3.8% for `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` responses. This is well above the 0.5% threshold stipulated in our SLA and is the primary driver for the discrepancies detailed in the reconciliation report (file#5b1d3e49f973459e).\n*   **Compliance Risk:** These delays are putting us at serious risk of breaching RBI's T+1 settlement TAT mandates. We need to resolve this urgently to maintain compliance and avoid potential penalties.\n\nWe've confirmed that our OAuth 2.0 client credential flow and JWT token management are functioning correctly, with no authentication-related errors logged in Kibana. The issue seems to be isolated to the server-side processing time on Flipkart's end following the migration.\n\nTo help us move forward, could you please provide the following?\n\n1.  **Deeper Diagnostics:** Can your engineering team investigate the performance of the database queries and any intermediary microservices that the refund API depends on? We suspect a specific query or service call to the new core banking system is the source of the latency.\n2.  **Granular Logs:** More detailed application-level logs, including database transaction times for the specific refund IDs in question, would be immensely helpful.\n\nOn our end, we have created JIRA PAY-9132 to track our mitigation efforts, which currently involve implementing a more resilient retry mechanism with exponential backoff. However, this is a temporary fix that doesn't address the underlying problem.\n\nI think a joint debugging session would be the most effective next step.

Building on the points raised in email 359f2528fdfa4156, we've completed a deeper investigation into the multi-currency settlement discrepancies for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9, and the issue is becoming a critical compliance concern.\n\nOur reconciliation engine is consistently flagging a mismatch averaging around 0.8-1.2% for refunds processed in non-INR currencies, primarily USD and AED. After analyzing the logs in Kibana, we can confirm the issue is not related to API availability or latency; your `/refund/settlement` endpoint is responding within the ~850ms SLA. The root cause is the final settled amount in INR.\n\nThe settlement files, as per the format outlined in file#5b1d3e49f973459e, do not contain the specific forex conversion rate applied by Flipkart's system at the time of refund settlement. This opacity is a direct problem for our compliance posture. RBI guidelines on cross-border payments mandate fully auditable records for every transaction leg, including the precise forex rates. Without this data point, our automated audit logs are incomplete, creating a significant finding for our upcoming SOC 2 Type II audit.\n\nI've attached a snapshot from our Grafana dashboard that visualizes the discrepancy trend over the last 14 days. The spikes correlate directly with batches of international refunds. The core problem is a floating conversion rate that isn't being communicated back to us, either via the API or the daily settlement report.\n\nTo resolve this permanently, we propose an enhancement: please include the `forexConversionRate` and `settlementCurrency` fields in the JSON response payload for the `/refund/settlement` endpoint. This would allow our system to perform real-time validation and finally close these reconciliation gaps. We're tracking this requirement under JIRA PAY-3219.\n\nGiven the mounting pressure and our compliance deadlines, could your team please assess the feasibility of this API change and provide an estimated timeline by EOD tomorrow? It's quite urgent we get this resolved to avoid any regulatory flags.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPriya Nair\nCompliance Specialist | Juspay"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T10:26:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["arjun.mehta@flipkart.com","fk-finance-tech@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

It helped our team correlate the settlement report discrepancies with our internal logs.\n\nBuilding on that, our engineering team has analyzed the Kibana logs and the settlement files (ref: file#5b1d3e49f973459e) for the last 15 days. We’ve confirmed that the discrepancy issue, as part of Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9, is isolated to multi-currency refunds, primarily impacting transactions in USD and EUR.\n\nThe root cause appears to be a variance in the FX rate applied. Our `/v1/refunds` API currently triggers a settlement process that uses the FX rate at the time of the refund (T+1 or T+2), not the rate from the original transaction. This is causing reconciliation mismatches that are currently averaging 1.2%—well above our target SLA of 0.1%.\n\nTo address this, we've created a proposal under JIRA ticket PAY-8303. We suggest augmenting the refund initiation request payload to include an optional `original_transaction_details` object. This object would carry the `fx_rate` and `base_currency_amount` from the initial charge. This will allow our settlement system to use the definitive original rate, ensuring precise reconciliation and better compliance with RBI reporting standards for forex transactions.\n\nTo be honest, the manual effort to reconcile these differences is becoming a significant operational overhead, so we're quite keen to get an automated fix in place.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Flipkart:** Could your technical team please review the proposed API payload change detailed in JIRA PAY-8303?\n2.  **Juspay & Flipkart:** I'd like to set up a 30-minute call next week with your API integration engineers to discuss the implementation and address any concerns from your side.\n\nOnce we have alignment, our team can deploy the changes to our shared Kubernetes staging environment within 5 business days for UAT.

Let's trace the transaction ID from the logs to pinpoint the exact failure point.\n2.  **Solution Design:** Decide between a hotfix (adjusting the IAM role) and a more robust change (e.g., adding a circuit breaker with an explicit alert). Sameer, need your input on whether the interim manual process is sufficient from a compliance standpoint.\n3.  **Action Plan:** Assign owners and ETAs for the fix, deployment, and post-release monitoring.

The core banking system migration seems to have introduced a bottleneck. My initial analysis points to the `settlement-batch-processor` service, which is showing p99 latency spikes up to 4.5s during the nightly refund file processing window. This is causing downstream reconciliation delays and has the potential to breach our SLA with Flipkart.\n\nThe Grafana dashboard (see linked Confluence page for snapshot) shows a direct correlation between batch size and database transaction lock contention within the Euler ledger service. I suspect the `update_refund_status` stored procedure is struggling with the new schema post-migration, which wasn't an issue on the legacy system. We need to validate this hypothesis and decide on a path forward, both for immediate mitigation and a permanent fix.\n\nProposed agenda & goals:\n1.  **Root Cause Validation:** Priya, can you walk us through the query execution plan for the `update_refund_status` procedure? I'm betting we're missing a critical index on the `merchant_transaction_id` post-migration.\n2.  **Short-Term Mitigation:** I propose we immediately reduce the default batch processing size in the processor's config from 10,000 to 2,000. This should reduce lock contention and stabilize the system. I have a config change ready (deployment ID `d-8F4C1A9E`) and can roll it out post this discussion.\n3.  **Long-Term Fix:** Agree on an owner and ETA for the permanent fix, which is likely re-indexing or refactoring the stored procedure.\n4.  **External Comms:** Rohan, we need to decide if we need to proactively communicate a potential delay in settlement confirmation to Flipkart for the next 24-48h.\n\nkeywords: PAY-5556, Euler, settlement, batch processing, database performance, lock contention, Flipkart, refund","status":"confirmed","createdAt":1757913960000,"updatedAt":1757915760000,"app":"google-calendar","entity":"event","creator":{"displayName":"Arjun Mehta","email":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in"},"startTime":1757913960000,"endTime":1757917560000,"joiningLink":"https://meet.google.com/c66-8a3e-c31","permissions":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","rohan.gupta@juspay.in","anjali.desai@juspay.in"]}},

Our Prometheus metrics show a sustained spike in HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses during the 02:00-04:00 UTC batch window, with our client hitting a hard ceiling of approximately 150 TPS. This throttling is creating a growing backlog in our refund reconciliation queue, managed via RabbitMQ, causing reconciliation delays that breach the 24-hour SLA. The current naive retry mechanism exacerbates the issue by contributing to request bursts that trigger the limiter almost immediately after a cool-down period, defeating its purpose.","To mitigate this, I propose implementing a client-side adaptive rate limiter using a token bucket algorithm within our `flipkart-connector` microservice. We will leverage the `resilience4j` RateLimiter module, configuring it with a `limitForPeriod` of 145 TPS and a `limitRefreshPeriod` of 1 second to operate just under the observed vendor threshold. For retries on 429s, the plan is to switch to a jittered exponential backoff strategy, with an initial interval of 500ms and a multiplier of 1.5. This configuration will be deployed as a feature flag managed by our internal config service, 'Hydra', enabling dynamic adjustments without a full redeployment. The changes are staged on the `feature/PAY-1229-adaptive-limiter` branch.","The immediate next step is to deploy this build to the `payments-staging-k8s-cluster` for a 48-hour soak test, closely monitoring the `flipkart_api_429_errors_total` counter in our Grafana dashboard. In parallel, we must formalize a request with Flipkart's technical account manager to increase our API quota to a target of 400 TPS, which aligns with our projected peak refund processing volume. A successful staging run will be followed by a production canary release targeting 5% of the reconciliation traffic, with a full rollout contingent on zero regressions in settlement success rates and a measurable reduction in queue depth on our Redis-backed retry store."],"owner":"Arjun Mehta","ownerEmail":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","photoLink":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/photo9","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arjun.mehta@juspay.in","tech-leads@juspay.in","product-team@juspay.in","compliance@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"application/json","createdAt":1757914200000,"updatedAt":1757914200000}},

Regarding the UPI settlement mismatch you highlighted from yesterday's T+1 file (as per email 0cf90ecc5cb54b45), I've spent the morning investigating the root cause, and I have an initial report.\n\nThis is definitely a high-priority issue for the UPI Mandate Implementation project (Work ID 452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2), as these reconciliation gaps can have significant financial and compliance implications.\n\n**Investigation Summary & Findings:**\n\nI've analyzed the Kibana logs for our `upi-mandate-processor` service, cross-referenced transaction IDs against our payment gateway DB, and correlated them with the settlement report (`file#b1ced9640b604a7f`) from NPCI. Our core infrastructure, including the Kubernetes cluster health and database performance, remained stable with an uptime of 99.99% and p99 latency well under our 500ms SLA.\n\nThe discrepancy appears to stem from how our system is handling a specific subset of transaction statuses, particularly late reversals initiated by NPCI. Out of the ~50,000 transactions in the analyzed batch, we found a mismatch of roughly 0.28%, impacting 142 transactions.\n\nSpecifically, the issue is tied to transactions that initially receive a success confirmation but are later reversed by the remitter bank. Our system correctly logs the initial success, but the subsequent asynchronous reversal notification from NPCI (often with response code `U69 - Transaction timed out at bank`) is not correctly updating the final transaction state in our settlement ledger. It's getting logged correctly by the core API, but the reconciliation service isn't picking it up before the T+1 cutoff.\n\nI’ve tracked this behavior under JIRA ticket **PAY-6952**. This seems to be a logical flaw in our reconciliation job rather than a fundamental issue with the OAuth 2.0 flow or JWT token validation with the NPCI gateway.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Patch (Owner: Me, ETA: EOD Today):** I am developing a patch for the reconciliation service to explicitly query for these `U69` reversal events against successful transactions within the settlement window. I'll deploy this to the staging environment for validation before a production push.\n\n2.  **Data Correction (Owner: Payments-DBA Team, ETA: Tomorrow, 12 PM IST):** Once the patch is validated, we'll need to run a correction script to update the final status of the 142 affected transactions to 'REVERSED' to ensure our books are balanced.\n\n3.  **Enhanced Monitoring (Owner: Me, ETA: End of week):** I'll add a new alert on our main Grafana payments dashboard (grafana.juspay.in/d/abc123/payments-latency). This alert will trigger if the discrepancy between our internal 'SUCCESS' count and NPCI's settled transaction count exceeds a 0.1% threshold for any given T+1 cycle. This should help us catch similar issues proactively.\n\nAs a follow-up to our earlier discussion in email a5f262d5d63e4011, I will also reach out to our NPCI contact to get formal confirmation on the expected processing window for these late reversals. Any delay on their end directly impacts our reconciliation window.\n\nLet me know if you have any immediate questions. I'll keep you updated on the progress of the patch deployment in the JIRA ticket.\n\nBest,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer"],"timestamp":1757913480000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Your concerns are absolutely valid, and I’ve spent the morning conducting a deeper dive from a compliance and regulatory perspective. I have to say, the issue is more significant than we initially thought.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, the current UPI mandate framework, as documented by NPCI, is explicitly architected for INR-denominated transactions. The introduction of multi-currency settlements for recurring payments immediately brings Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) regulations into scope, which our current integration is not equipped to handle. Our SOC 2 and RBI audit trails require meticulous logging of currency conversion rates, forex markup, and the underlying authorized dealer (AD) bank details for each cross-border transaction. None of this is currently supported.\n\nTechnically, this poses a direct threat to our settlement and reconciliation engine. The system is hardwired to parse NPCI's T+1 settlement files based on a fixed INR format and match them using the transaction RRN. Introducing foreign currency codes (e.g., USD, AED) without a corresponding settlement amount in INR and the applied FX rate would break our reconciliation logic. The 'UPI-Settlement-Health' dashboard on Grafana is currently showing a reconciliation success rate of 99.97%; I'm not comfortable risking that without a clear, tested path forward. I've been digging through Kibana logs for any past instances of non-INR transaction attempts, and they all result in a 'U16' error code (Invalid currency) from the NPCI gateway, as expected.\n\nI’ve cross-referenced this against the API specification in file#b1ced9640b604a7f and your notes from email#a5f262d5d63e4011. There are no endpoints to fetch certified FX rates or dedicated fields in the `/mandates/execute` API response to confirm multi-currency settlement details. This feels like a critical gap from NPCI's side.\n\nTo de-risk this for Work ID 452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2, we must obtain the following from NPCI before we commit any further engineering resources:\n\n1.  **Formal API Documentation:** Detailed specs for the multi-currency mandate and settlement flow, including error codes, authentication requirements (if different from the standard OAuth 2.0 flow), and settlement file formats.\n2.  **Regulatory Circular:** A formal notification or written confirmation from NPCI's compliance team on how this process adheres to RBI/FEMA guidelines.\n3.  **Sandbox Environment:** Access to a UAT environment where we can perform end-to-end testing of the entire lifecycle of a multi-currency mandate.\n\nI've updated the blockers and added these requirements to JIRA ticket PAY-2079. I think we need to formally escalate this to our relationship manager at NPCI. This is a significant blocker, and proceeding without clarity could put us at serious regulatory risk.\n\nLet’s connect later today to draft that communication.\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya Nair\nCompliance Specialist | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757913900000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on your analysis in email 902d9e2212db4e82, my team has confirmed the severity of the issue. The API timeouts are directly correlated with the OAuth token refresh failures for the UPI Mandate Implementation project (Work ID 452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2).\n\nThis is becoming a critical operational risk. Our Grafana dashboards show a worrying trend over the last 3 hours:\n- The error rate for mandate creation calls has spiked from our baseline of ~0.3% to 4.8%.\n- P99 latency has degraded significantly, moving from a stable ~220ms to over 2.1s, which is causing cascading timeouts for our merchants.\n\nDigging into the Kibana logs, we're seeing a pattern of HTTP 401 \"Invalid Token\" responses from the NPCI `/mandate/v2/create` endpoint. It appears our service is intermittently failing to refresh the JWT access token before it expires, leading to a series of failed requests. The root cause seems to be in the token refresh flow itself, not in the initial token generation. I've compiled the relevant log snippets and linked them in JIRA PAY-8439.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this instability puts us in a tricky spot regarding the RBI's e-mandate guidelines and could impact our upcoming SOC 2 audit if it persists. We need to demonstrate system reliability.\n\nI've already initiated a review of our implementation against NPCI's specs (as per `file#b1ced9640b604a7f`) and can't find an obvious deviation, which makes me suspect this might be an issue on the NPCI side, perhaps related to rate limiting on their auth servers, similar to what we discussed in `email#a5f262d5d63e4011`.\n\nHere’s the plan:\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation:** Can we deploy a hotfix to shorten the pre-expiry refresh window for these tokens in the staging environment? Let's reduce it from 5 minutes to 10 minutes to see if more aggressive refreshing helps.\n2.  **Engineering Deep Dive (Owner: Aditya):** Please prioritize PAY-8439. We need a root cause analysis on why the refresh mechanism is failing under load. Is it a concurrency issue within the Kubernetes pods or something else?\n3.  **External Communication (Owner: Anjali):** I will draft a formal inquiry to our technical SPOC at NPCI by EOD today. I'll include transaction IDs, timestamps, and our logs to expedite their investigation.\n\nLet's sync up for 15 minutes at 4:00 PM IST today to finalize the communication to NPCI and review the hotfix plan. I'll send out the invite. We need to get this under control before it impacts a larger volume of transactions.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjali Patel"],"timestamp":1757914200000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This sensitive data is being persisted in plain text within the 'juspay-settlement-logs-prod' S3 bucket. The risk is compounded by an overly permissive IAM policy ('BroadS3Access-Legacy') attached to the service role, which allows 's3:*' actions across multiple buckets, not just the intended log destination.","Immediate remediation requires a two-pronged approach. First, an emergency hotfix (version 1.7.1) must be deployed to update the 'log4j2.xml' configuration, elevating the log level for the 'in.juspay.settlement.flipkart' package from DEBUG to INFO within the production environment. This will cease the immediate data leakage.

Building on the preliminary analysis shared in file 49a3d287719c4892, I need to escalate the severity of the KYC automation failures we are observing.\n\nOver the last 48 hours, the failure rate for our automated KYC verification calls for customer segments our systems flag as 'high-risk' has spiked dramatically. We've gone from a stable baseline of <1% to over 15% in this specific cohort. Our Grafana dashboards show a clear correlation, and this is now impacting a significant volume of refund settlements.\n\nTechnically, our settlement reconciliation engine is flagging these failures when calling your `v2/kyc/verify` endpoint. We are receiving a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response, but the error payload is generic and lacks the detail needed for us to isolate the root cause. I want to be clear: this is not an authentication issue. Our OAuth 2.0 flow using JWTs is healthy, with P99 latency at a stable 250ms for all other API interactions. Our Kibana logs confirm the issue is isolated to this specific endpoint and user segment.\n\nThe business impact is becoming quite concerning. This is forcing manual intervention by my team, which is not scalable and pushes the settlement timeline for these affected refunds from T+1 to T+3. More critically, this gap in automated verification for high-risk accounts creates a significant compliance risk for us under current RBI AML/KYC guidelines. We are tracking this with the highest urgency under JIRA ticket PAY-9722.\n\nTo move forward, we urgently need your team's support on the following:\n\n1.  **Log Analysis:** Can your engineering team please analyze the request/response logs for your `v2/kyc/verify` service for the batch of `transaction_ids` attached to JIRA PAY-9722?\n2.  **Recent Changes:** Have there been any recent deployments or changes to your internal risk scoring logic or the data schema for this user segment that might result in an unprocessable state?\n3.  **Joint Debugging Session:** We need to schedule a joint call with your API engineering team to troubleshoot this. Please let me know your team's availability for tomorrow.\n\nThis issue is a critical blocker for the broader Flipkart Refund Settlement Discrepancy Resolution project (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9).

Building on your analysis from email 5be432607c354cc1, I've investigated the compliance and operational impact of the ongoing Flipkart API rate-limiting issues.\n\nThe situation is becoming critical. Our Grafana dashboards confirm that between 14:00 and 17:00 IST daily, our refund reconciliation service throughput plummets from a target of 150 TPS to under 40 TPS. The Kibana logs are flooded with `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors from Flipkart's `/v2/payments/refund/status` endpoint. Our OAuth 2.0 flow is healthy, and JWTs are being generated and accepted, so this is purely a server-side throttling issue on Flipkart's end.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is a major concern. This throttling is creating a significant backlog, pushing our settlement times for a growing number of refunds past the T+1 SLA and into T+2 territory. This directly exposes us to potential non-compliance with RBI's defined Turnaround Time (TAT) for refund processing. The audit trail for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9 is starting to look problematic, and this will be a difficult point to defend during our upcoming SOC 2 audit cycle.\n\nI’ve updated JIRA PAY-4766 with these findings. As a short-term mitigation, can we prioritize implementing an exponential backoff mechanism in our reconciliation engine? It won't solve the root cause but should at least reduce the error noise and stabilize the service slightly.\n\nHowever, the long-term solution requires action from Flipkart. Based on the transaction volume analysis in file#49a3d287719c4892, we need a sustained throughput capacity of at least 200 TPS to clear the backlog and handle projected volumes. We need to formally request an increase in our API rate limit.\n\nRohan, could you please help identify the appropriate API platform or engineering team at Flipkart we can discuss this with? The current limits are severely hampering our mutual operations.\n\nLet's connect on this tomorrow to align on an escalation path.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPriya Nair\nCompliance Specialist | Juspay"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T11:11:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","rohan.verma@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on the analysis from your last email (77dd690e10564777), our team has performed a deeper investigation into the ongoing UPI refund settlement discrepancy.\n\nWe're still observing a persistent mismatch between the refund statuses reported via your `/refund/status` API endpoint and the final settlement files (like the one referenced as file#49a3d287719c4892) we receive at T+1. The discrepancy rate is now hovering around 0.8%, which is unfortunately well above our acceptable threshold of 0.1% and is creating significant operational overhead for our finance team.\n\nOur engineering lead on this, Priya, has thoroughly analyzed the Kibana logs for all failed `refund_id` lookups over the past 72 hours. We can confirm that we are not seeing any timeouts, network issues, or non-200 responses from our side when polling your API endpoint. Our Grafana dashboards show a stable p99 latency of ~220ms for these calls, which is well within the expected performance envelope.\n\nThe core issue, as tracked in JIRA PAY-8724, appears to be a state mismatch within Flipkart's downstream systems. We successfully initiate the refund, receive an acknowledgment, but the final status communicated via API doesn't align with the settlement file. For instance, for `flipkart_refund_id: FKREF891234756`, your API returned `STATUS: PROCESSING` for about 12 hours before changing to `STATUS: FAILED` with error code `E504_BANK_REJECT`. However, this specific refund was absent from the subsequent T+1 settlement failure report, leaving its status ambiguous. This is just one of over 150 similar cases from yesterday's batch.\n\nTo be frank, the manual reconciliation effort is becoming unsustainable, especially with the festive season approaching. We anticipate a 40% surge in transaction volumes, and we must have this automated process running flawlessly to remain compliant with RBI's T+1 settlement mandates.\n\nTo move this forward, could your technical team please:\n\n1.  **Investigate the state transition logic** between your refund processing engine and the settlement reporting system? We need to understand the lifecycle of a refund that is marked as `FAILED` in the API but doesn't appear in the reconciliation files.\n2.  **Provide us with more granular logs** for a sample of the affected `flipkart_refund_id`s?

The problem occurs when our KYC microservice, deployed in the `payments-prod` K8s cluster, makes an API call to our third-party KYC vendor's `/v3/verify/enhanced` endpoint.\n2.  **Error Pattern:** We're observing a significant increase in `429 Too Many Requests` errors, coupled with intermittent `401 Unauthorized` responses. This is not a simple network issue, as standard verification calls to their `/v2/verify/standard` endpoint are processing normally with a p99 latency under 450ms.\n3.  **Root Cause Hypothesis:** The `401` errors are particularly concerning. My initial hypothesis is a problem with the JWT token management within the OAuth 2.0 flow specific to this \"enhanced\" scope. It seems their API gateway might be incorrectly invalidating our tokens under the concurrent load generated by a batch of high-risk refund requests. The p99 latency for this specific API call has degraded from a baseline of ~800ms to over 2.5s before failure, which points towards a bottleneck on their end.\n\n**Impact:**\nThese failures are triggering our fallback mechanism to manual KYC, which is creating a significant backlog. This directly jeopardizes our T+1 settlement SLA with Flipkart and introduces a compliance risk that could be flagged during our upcoming SOC 2 and PCI DSS audits.

We're seeing a consistent discrepancy of approximately 0.8% on refund batches involving non-INR currencies, which is a bit concerning as it's preventing our automated T+1 reconciliation from closing cleanly.\n\nOur investigation, based on Kibana logs for our settlement processor and cross-referencing API call data, points towards a potential timing issue with the foreign exchange rate application. It seems the rate used at the point of refund initiation via your `/v2/refunds` endpoint is different from the rate applied during the generation of the final settlement file we receive via SFTP.\n\nFor a concrete example, we looked at `refund_id: FLIP-REF-735626-XYZ` from yesterday's batch. Our logs show the refund creation call returned an `exchangeRate` of 83.5 INR/USD. However, the corresponding entry in the settlement report (`file#49a3d287719c4892`) was calculated using a rate closer to 83.2, resulting in a minor but cumulative shortfall. This is becoming a significant operational overhead and raises questions for our RBI compliance audits regarding cross-border fund movements.\n\nTo address this, we have a couple of proposals, which we're tracking under JIRA PAY-6394:\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation:** Could you confirm if the exact `settlementExchangeRate` can be added as a column to the daily settlement report? This would at least allow our Ops team to perform manual reconciliation without having to reverse-calculate the rate.\n\n2.  **Long-Term Solution:** We strongly recommend enhancing the `/v2/refunds/status` API endpoint. Ideally, once a refund is processed and settled, a call to this endpoint should return the final `settlementAmount` and `settlementCurrency` (e.g., INR) alongside the original `refundAmount` and `refundCurrency` (e.g., USD). This would provide an immutable, auditable record directly via the API, eliminating any ambiguity. Our current OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token management can easily accommodate these additional fields without compromising security.\n\nThis resolution is currently our highest priority for the Flipkart integration. Could your engineering team please evaluate the feasibility of the long-term API enhancement? The details align with the initial scope discussed in email#5be432607c354cc1.\n\nA quick 30-minute sync between our technical leads would probably be the most efficient way to finalize the path forward. Please let me know what your availability looks like for early next week.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead\nJuspay"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T11:14:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on your email (a8c473b13552445f), I've been digging into our logs and have some findings to share regarding the latency spike.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show a clear anomaly. The P99 latency for our real-time risk scoring engine’s `/v2/risk/evaluate` endpoint, which normally operates around 150ms, spiked to over 2.5s during the incident window yesterday. This directly correlated with a surge in `504 Gateway Timeout` errors on refund transactions originating from Flipkart, pushing the error rate from a baseline of 0.2% to nearly 4.5% for that specific workflow. This is becoming a bit of a headache as it's impacting our settlement SLAs.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, these timeouts and subsequent refund failures are a significant concern. They directly impact our ability to adhere to the T+1 settlement cycle mandated by RBI guidelines and create a messy reconciliation trail, which is the primary focus of this workstream (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9).\n\nThe logs you shared in `file#49a3d287719c4892` were helpful, but they seem to stop just before the critical timeout period. To get to the bottom of this, as tracked in JIRA PAY-3791, we need a more complete picture from your end. Could your team please provide more verbose, end-to-end logs for a sample of the failed `transaction_ids`? We need to see the full request lifecycle, from your system's call to our `/payments/refund` endpoint, through the OAuth 2.0 token acquisition, to the final response received (or not received) from our API gateway.\n\nOur current working theory, which builds on the initial thoughts from email `5be432607c354cc1`, is that there may be a network-level delay or a bottleneck in the JWT token management on your side before the request even reaches our infrastructure. Our Kubernetes pods for the risk engine scaled as expected, and we're not seeing any CPU or memory constraints on our end.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Flipkart Team:** Please provide the detailed end-to-end transaction logs by EOD tomorrow, so we can perform a proper timestamp correlation.\n2.  **Juspay (My Team):** I will continue to work with our SREs to analyze network traces within our VPC to definitively rule out any internal bottlenecks.\n\nOnce we have your logs, we should be able to pinpoint the latency source.

Building on your last update in email 33d51709421142ac, our team has done a deeper dive into the KYC automation failures that are causing these refund settlement discrepancies.\n\nWhile you suggested a possible issue with our OAuth token generation, our security and infrastructure teams have confirmed that our JWTs are being generated and presented correctly, and our OAuth 2.0 flow is operating within spec. We see no authentication-related errors in our logs.\n\nOur investigation points towards a performance issue on the Flipkart side, specifically with the KYC verification endpoint for high-risk customer segments. Here’s what we're seeing:\n\n1.  **High Latency & Timeouts:** Our Grafana dashboards show that calls to your `/kyc/v3/verify` endpoint are timing out consistently for a specific user cohort. While p99 latency for standard users is stable at ~350ms, for this 'high-risk' segment, it's spiking to over 4.5 seconds before our service times out. This is well above the 800ms SLA we agreed upon.\n\n2.  **Elevated Error Rates:** We are observing a 6.8% failure rate for these specific KYC checks, which directly corresponds to the volume of refunds falling out of the automated T+1 settlement batch. This is being tracked under JIRA PAY-8339. As you know, this manual fallback process is not sustainable and introduces significant compliance risk under current RBI guidelines.\n\n3.  **Log Analysis:** A review of our Kibana logs shows our system successfully initiates the request, but we receive a `504 Gateway Timeout` from your end. We have cross-referenced this with the analysis from our previous incident (ref: email#5be432607c354cc1) and the patterns are dissimilar, suggesting a new root cause.\n\nOur current hypothesis is that a recent change in your internal risk-scoring engine or a downstream dependency it relies on is causing this processing delay for high-risk profiles. This is causing a cascade failure in our refund settlement process, which is the focus of Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nTo move forward, could your team please:\n\n*   **Investigate the performance** of the `/kyc/v3/verify` endpoint's underlying services, focusing on the processing path for high-risk user profiles.\n*   **Share server-side logs** for the list of `juspay_txn_id`s that I have compiled in the attached sheet (ref: file#49a3d287719c4892) for the timeframe of 08:00 to 14:00 IST yesterday.\n*   **Arrange a joint-debugging session** between your API engineering team and our payments integration lead, Priya Sharma. My calendar is open for any time tomorrow afternoon.\n\nThis is becoming a bit of a critical issue for our finance operations team, so a prompt investigation would be greatly appreciated.

Regarding the refund settlement discrepancies you highlighted in email e970cd7622a546b6, I've conducted a deep dive into our infrastructure logs and API communication with Flipkart for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nThe investigation confirms our suspicion: the primary bottleneck is aggressive API rate-limiting on Flipkart's end. Our settlement reconciliation service is being systematically throttled when calling their `/v2/settlements/refunds/query` endpoint, resulting in a high volume of HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) errors.\n\nHere’s a summary of the impact:\n\n*   **Performance Degradation:** Our Grafana metrics show error rates for this specific job spiking to nearly 40% during batch runs. This has crippled our transaction throughput, reducing it from a target of 60 TPS to an unstable average of ~18-20 TPS.\n*   **Compliance Risk:** The direct consequence is a growing backlog of unprocessed refunds. We are now dangerously close to breaching the T+2 settlement SLA mandated by RBI guidelines for a substantial portion of these transactions. This is a serious compliance concern.\n*   **Latency Impact:** P99 latency for the API calls has surged from a healthy ~300ms to over 2.8s during periods of throttling, causing our job execution times to balloon.\n\nI've verified that our systems are not the cause. Our Kubernetes deployment for the settlement service is scaling as expected, and our OAuth 2.0 flow with JWT token management is stable with no authentication failures. The Kibana logs (see attached snippets in file#49a3d287719c4892) clearly show successful requests followed by a wall of 429s once a certain threshold is hit. This issue is becoming critical and is preventing us from meeting our core processing objectives.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **For Flipkart:** Rohan, could you please provide the specific rate-limiting configuration (both burst and sustained TPS) applied to our client ID? We urgently request that you increase our API quota to a minimum of 120 TPS. This aligns with the projected volumes discussed in our initial integration talks (ref: email#5be432607c354cc1) and is necessary to clear the current backlog and handle daily volume without violating compliance timelines.\n\n2.  **For Juspay (Internal):** As a temporary mitigation, I can introduce an exponential backoff with jitter into our API client. However, this is a stopgap measure that will further delay processing; it doesn’t solve the underlying capacity issue. I've updated JIRA PAY-7163 with these technical findings.\n\n3.  **Proposed Meeting:** I suggest we schedule a 30-minute technical sync-up call with the relevant engineers from Flipkart tomorrow to address the quota increase and establish a more scalable long-term path. \n\nWe need to resolve this bottleneck to ensure smooth settlement operations and maintain our compliance posture.

Building on your findings in email 8947e86b2137411d, I've completed a deeper dive into the Flipkart UPI refund settlement discrepancy, and the situation is more critical than we initially thought.\n\nThe total variance over the last 72 hours has now crossed ₹1.2 Cr, impacting approximately 15,000 transactions. This is a material amount, and the delay in resolution from Flipkart's side is becoming a significant concern, especially with our T+1 settlement cycle.\n\nI've cross-referenced our settlement ledger against raw transaction data from the primary UPI gateway and Kibana logs. Our systems are functioning as expected. For the affected batch, our settlement service correctly processed the refunds, with state transitions from `REFUND_INITIATED` to `REFUND_SUCCESS` occurring at a P99 latency of 280ms. The NPCI response codes are clean, and there are no abnormal error spikes on our Grafana dashboards that would indicate a failure on our end.\n\nMy hypothesis aligns with the initial thoughts in file#49a3d287719c4892: the issue seems to stem from Flipkart's reconciliation logic. We are not seeing any API authentication failures on our end—our monitoring shows zero 4xx errors related to their calls, ruling out an OAuth 2.0 token expiry problem. It appears their system is either not correctly consuming the final status from our `/v2/orders/{order_id}/refunds` endpoint or is misinterpreting the settlement file we provide.\n\nThis prolonged discrepancy is a compliance risk that could draw scrutiny during our next RBI audit. We need to demonstrate decisive action.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Anjali (Me):** I will consolidate all discrepant transaction IDs, building on the list from email#5be432607c354cc1, and send a formal escalation email to our primary contacts at Flipkart by 4 PM IST today.

Building on your summary from email a1dd6744b3754eb0, our team has completed a deeper dive into the multi-currency refund settlement discrepancies we've been tracking under Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nOur reconciliation engine flagged a persistent discrepancy rate of approximately 0.75% over the past two weeks for refunds involving non-INR currencies, specifically USD and SGD. This is a significant deviation from our expected tolerance of <0.1% and is creating downstream accounting and compliance challenges. The detailed transaction IDs and variance analysis are attached in the summary sheet (ref: file#49a3d287719c4892).\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, after analyzing the Kibana logs for payloads sent to our `/v1/settlements/reconciliation` endpoint, we've correlated the issue to inconsistencies in how foreign exchange rates are being reported in the settlement files. For a subset of transactions, the `finalSettlementAmount` does not align with the `baseAmount` and the implied exchange rate at the time of refund processing. This is particularly problematic as it violates the audit trail requirements under recent RBI circulars for cross-border payments, which mandate explicit recording of the applied FX rate for each transaction.\n\nTo ensure full compliance and streamline the reconciliation process, we need to enforce a stricter data contract. As discussed internally and referenced in JIRA ticket PAY-2626, we propose modifying the settlement file structure to mandatorily include the following fields for all multi-currency transactions:\n\n1.  `base_currency` (e.g., \"INR\")\n2.  `base_amount`\n3.  `settlement_currency` (e.g., \"USD\")\n4.  `settlement_amount`\n5.  `applied_fx_rate` (to 6 decimal places)\n6.  `fx_rate_timestamp` (ISO 8601 format)\n\nThis will eliminate ambiguity and allow our automated systems to perform precise T+1 reconciliation without manual intervention, which has become a growing operational burden. The previous discussion on this topic in email thread 5be432607c354cc1 hinted at this possibility, and I believe now is the time to formalize it.\n\nCould you please confirm with your engineering team if this schema modification is feasible on your end? We're a bit pressed on this, as our upcoming SOC 2 audit requires us to demonstrate a fully automated and compliant reconciliation process for all transaction types by the end of this quarter.\n\nLet me know if a quick technical call would be helpful to align on the implementation details.

Building on your analysis in email ae3700384d824477, our team has been digging into the root cause, and we have a strong lead.\n\nOur investigation points to a specific failure pattern linked to our KYC automation process for certain high-risk customer segments, an issue we're tracking internally under JIRA PAY-5540. It appears that when our fraud detection engine flags a user for enhanced due diligence post-transaction, the subsequent automated refund initiation is not being correctly reconciled in the nightly settlement file your system generates.\n\nLooking at the Kibana logs for the sample `merchant_refund_id`s you provided (e.g., `FK-REF-98721B3A`), we see our system correctly initiates the refund via a POST to your `/v2/payments/refund` endpoint. However, our system tags the transaction with a custom internal status, `KYC_VERIFICATION_PENDING_MANUAL_REVIEW`, before we receive the final confirmation. My suspicion is that your settlement reconciliation logic may not be configured to handle this state, causing these specific refunds to be dropped from the T+1 batch file. The attached analysis in file#49a3d287719c4892 provides a detailed log trace for three such instances.\n\nThe discrepancy volume is now hovering around 0.45% of our daily refund volume with Flipkart, which is becoming a bit of a blocker for our finance team's reconciliation efforts. This entire effort, tracked under our internal Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9, is a high priority for us to ensure we remain compliant with RBI guidelines on timely refund processing.\n\nOur engineering lead suggests a quick path to resolution would be for your system to correctly parse and include transactions in this `KYC_VERIFICATION_PENDING_MANUAL_REVIEW` state in the settlement file, even if as a pending item. Long-term, as we proposed in Doc#72cebeab00364159, aligning on a standardized set of status codes for these edge cases via the API would prevent future issues.\n\nCould your engineering team investigate if the reconciliation service can be updated to handle this status?

Building on the data you provided in email 72cebeab00364159, my team has completed a deeper dive into the UPI refund settlement discrepancies, and the issue is more persistent than we initially thought.\n\nOur reconciliation service flagged a 1.2% discrepancy rate in yesterday's T+1 settlement file (`FK_REFUND_SETTLEMENT_20241112.csv`, which I've re-attached from email 5be432607c354cc1 for clarity). This directly impacts our ability to meet RBI's mandated settlement timelines and is causing a growing number of exceptions for our finance team to handle manually.\n\nHere’s a specific example we traced:\n\n*   **Juspay Transaction ID:** `JUSPAY_TXN_524458F8D9E0`\n*   **Action:** Refund initiated via your `/v2/refunds/initiate` endpoint on Nov 11, 2024, at 16:15 IST.\n*   **API Response:** We received a `202 ACCEPTED` response immediately. Our subsequent polling of the `/v2/refunds/status` endpoint returned a final `\"status\":\"SUCCESS\"` at 16:18 IST. The average latency for this check is hovering around 250ms.\n*   **Discrepancy:** This transaction ID was completely missing from the T+1 settlement file generated on Nov 12.\n\nOur Kibana logs (query linked in JIRA PAY-6837) confirm that our production Kubernetes pods correctly processed the successful API response and marked the refund as complete in our system. However, the Grafana dashboard tracking 'Flipkart-Juspay Settlement Mismatch' shows this is not an isolated incident; the gap has been widening over the past 72 hours.\n\nOur primary hypothesis is that there might be a state synchronization issue between your real-time refund processing service and the downstream batch system that generates the daily settlement files. The API is confirming success, but that status isn't being reliably propagated for financial reconciliation. This creates a significant audit trail problem for us, especially concerning our SOC 2 compliance which requires immutable transaction logging.\n\nTo move forward on this (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9), could you please:\n\n1.  **Trace the lifecycle** of `JUSPAY_TXN_524458F8D9E0` within your internal systems?

Is there a more definitive endpoint or perhaps an asynchronous webhook notification system we can subscribe to? Relying on a T+1 file with discrepancies is becoming operationally unsustainable.\n\nThis has become a high-priority issue. Our finance team is getting anxious about the reconciliation overhead.

The Kubernetes ingress controller for the CBS cluster is timing out requests, suggesting the CBS application pods are overwhelmed and not processing the queue fast enough during the T+1 settlement window.\n\n3.  **Inconsistent State:** The primary reconciliation job that ingests Flipkart’s daily refund file (ref: file#49a3d287719c4892) is failing mid-execution due to these timeouts. Since the job isn't fully atomic, these failures are leaving our ledger in an inconsistent state relative to Flipkart's records. This is causing the ~1.5% discrepancy rate we're currently fighting, which is a significant jump from our <0.1% SLA.\n\nThe immediate business impact is a growing financial liability and operational overhead. We're manually reconciling the fallout, but it's not sustainable and puts us at risk of breaching RBI's T+1 settlement timeline mandate. This also has potential implications for our SOC 2 compliance regarding data integrity.\n\nI’ve updated JIRA PAY-5518 with these technical findings.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **For the Engineering Team (Rahul):** Could you please prioritize investigating the CBS's database connection pooling and pod resource limits in the production K8s environment? The contention seems to be the primary cause, as we also noted in the early analysis in Doc#8397f1b7d2ae4e15.\n*   **For my Operations Team:** We will continue manual reconciliation to mitigate financial exposure and will keep providing daily fallout reports. However, we urgently need an ETA on a fix to manage expectations with the Flipkart team.\n\nI’m a bit concerned about the exposure here. Could we explore implementing a circuit breaker with an exponential backoff strategy in our settlement service? It would make the process more resilient to these CBS slowdowns while we work on the root cause.\n\nLet's connect first thing tomorrow to align on a concrete plan. I need to give a credible update to Flipkart by EOD.\n\nThanks,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead\nJuspay"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T11:20:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["rahul.verma@juspay.in","priya.sharma@flipkart.com","finance.ops@juspay.in","devops.team@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

I've spent the morning analyzing the compliance and operational impact of this latency spike in our real-time risk scoring engine, specifically concerning the Flipkart Refund Settlement process (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9).\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is quite concerning. Our Grafana dashboards confirm the p99 latency for the `risk-scoring-service` surged to over 2.1s yesterday, a significant deviation from our ~450ms baseline. This isn't just a performance metric; it directly threatens our T+1 settlement SLA with Flipkart. Any delay in risk scoring means we might be processing fraudulent refund claims, which creates a financial liability and will certainly be a point of scrutiny in our upcoming SOC 2 and RBI audits. The audit logs are clear on the processing delays.\n\nDrilling down into the Kibana logs for the affected period, I'm seeing a high volume of `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors when the risk engine attempts to call a third-party data enrichment API. This corroborates the SRE team's initial findings. I've attached these specific log snippets and my analysis to JIRA PAY-2837. This issue resulted in a backlog of approximately 1,500 refund requests missing the T+1 cutoff. We had to process these manually in a subsequent batch, which is what triggered the discrepancy report from Flipkart's finance team this morning (ref: `file#49a3d287719c4892`).\n\nWhile engineering investigates the third-party service, we need to consider our own resilience. Do we have a circuit breaker or a fallback mechanism for this flow? For example, if the primary engine's latency exceeds an 800ms threshold, could we default to a simplified internal model for low-value transactions to ensure we meet the settlement window? This would be critical for maintaining business continuity and compliance.\n\nI'm setting up a 30-minute call for tomorrow morning with you and the product team to define a short-term mitigation strategy. We can't go into another settlement cycle with this vulnerability.\n\nLet me know if you have any immediate thoughts.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T11:20:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@juspay.in","sanjay.mehta@juspay.in","flipkart.accounts@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on the thread from email 9596ecc933a4413c, our engineering team has completed a root cause analysis for the ongoing refund settlement discrepancies (Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9).\n\nOur investigation strongly indicates the issue stems from intermittent timeouts when our services attempt to refresh OAuth 2.0 access tokens via your `/auth/token` endpoint.\n\nHere’s a summary of our findings:\n\n1.  **Error Correlation:** Our Grafana monitoring dashboard shows a direct correlation between a spike in P99 latency for the `/auth/token` endpoint (exceeding our 2.5s connection timeout) and failures in our downstream refund reconciliation job. Error rates for these API calls have jumped from a baseline of <0.1% to approximately 4.5% over the last 48 hours.\n2.  **Log Analysis:** Kibana logs for our reconciliation service consistently show `java.net.ConnectException: Connection timed out` when trying to obtain a new JWT. This prevents us from authenticating subsequent calls to the `/v2/refunds/status` API, leading to the settlement data gap. The detailed log traces were shared earlier in file#49a3d287719c4892.\n3.  **System Impact:** The failed token acquisition is causing a cascade failure in our T+1 batch settlement process. This is creating a growing backlog of unverified refunds that require manual reconciliation, which is not scalable and introduces a risk of non-compliance with RBI's settlement TAT guidelines. As you know, maintaining accurate audit trails is critical for our SOC 2 compliance as well.\n\nThis issue has been formally tracked on our side under JIRA ticket PAY-3821.\n\nAs a temporary mitigation, we have considered increasing the client-side timeout. However, this is a band-aid fix that could negatively impact the performance of our Kubernetes pod resources. The core issue appears to be on the server-side, and it's becoming quite urgent to resolve this to avoid further settlement delays.\n\nCould your team please prioritize an investigation into the health and performance of your OAuth service? Specifically, we'd appreciate it if you could check for any performance degradation, recent deployments, or resource constraints affecting the `/auth/token` endpoint.\n\nLet me know if you need any further data from our side.

Building on the analysis from your previous email (d2d49c4e3db348bd), I've completed a deep dive on our side using the data from file#49a3d287719c4892.\n\nThe findings confirm the core issue we're tracking in JIRA PAY-4948. There's a persistent discrepancy in the UPI refund settlement statuses. We are consistently seeing a delta of ~0.75% between the refunds your system initiates via our `/v2/refunds/initiate` endpoint and the final settled transactions recorded in our T+1 reconciliation system. This is creating a fair amount of manual reconciliation work for our finance team, which is becoming a bit of a headache.\n\nFrom a performance standpoint, our systems are operating within expected parameters. Our Grafana dashboards show the P99 latency for our acknowledgement callback is stable at ~1.8s, well within the 2s SLA. Digging into the Kibana logs for the affected `merchant_order_id`s, the root cause appears to be a timing issue inherent to the UPI network's asynchronous nature. Our system correctly accepts the refund request and returns a `202 Accepted` status, but the final settlement confirmation from the remitter bank via NPCI can be delayed by anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes. Your system seems to be marking the refund as 'complete' based on our initial API acknowledgement, creating this state mismatch.\n\nTo resolve this permanently and ensure we are both fully aligned with RBI guidelines on timely and accurate refund processing, I'd like to propose we introduce a finality webhook. Instead of relying solely on the initial synchronous API response, your system could subscribe to an asynchronous notification that Juspay would trigger only *after* we receive the final RRN confirmation from the NPCI network. This would provide an immutable, bank-confirmed status for each refund, eliminating any ambiguity. This is a pattern we've used successfully with other partners, as briefly touched upon in email#5be432607c354cc1.\n\nThis new webhook would naturally be secured using our standard OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow with signed JWT payloads, ensuring it meets our mutual SOC 2 and PCI DSS compliance requirements.\n\nCould you please review this analysis with your team and confirm if your refund processing workflow can accommodate an additional asynchronous settlement confirmation? Getting this resolved is a high priority for the objectives outlined in Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nAs a next step, I will start drafting a technical specification for this proposed webhook. It would be great if we could get your initial thoughts on feasibility by EOD tomorrow so we can align on a path forward.\n\nThanks,"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T11:22:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.sharma@juspay.in","ankit.desai@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"]}},

We've completed our initial investigation into the issue, and I wanted to share our findings and immediate actions for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nOur analysis confirms the issue originated on our end. After cross-referencing the transaction IDs from the report you shared (file#49a3d287719c4892) with our Kibana logs, we've traced the root cause to a recent update in our internal fraud detection model. The model was generating an excessive number of false positives for legitimate Flipkart refund requests.\n\nSpecifically, a new rule set deployed 72 hours ago seems to be overly sensitive. The false positive rate for Flipkart refund API calls surged from our baseline of 0.2% to approximately 4.5%. This triggered a `403 Forbidden` response with our internal error code `ERR_RISK_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED` for these transactions, which is why they failed to appear in the T+1 settlement files.\n\nTo mitigate this immediately, we have disabled the problematic rule in our production environment as of 14:00 IST today. Our Grafana dashboards already show the error rate for the refund endpoint has dropped back to the expected ~0.15%, and API latency is stable at 180ms P99.\n\nHere’s our plan moving forward:\n\n1.  **Reconciliation:** My team is manually compiling a list of all impacted refund transactions. We will process these via a back-office channel to ensure they are included in the next T+2 settlement cycle. We will share this reconciliation file with you for verification by EOD today.\n\n2.  **Permanent Fix:** Our Risk Engineering team has taken this up under JIRA ticket PAY-2172. They are working on refining the model's logic to better account for Flipkart's bulk refund patterns without compromising our risk posture. They will be using the last 30 days of data for retraining and will push the updated model to staging for validation by tomorrow.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the operational friction this has caused. We are treating this with the highest priority and will provide a full post-mortem once the permanent solution is deployed.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead | Juspay"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T11:23:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["saurabh.gupta@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on the points you raised in `b26f5676f8c24e20`, I've completed a full audit of the disputed transactions against our internal systems.\n\nMy team has analyzed the consolidated refund report (file#49a3d287719c4892) for the settlement period of June 10-12. While your report marks all 4,152 refunds as 'SUCCESS', our settlement system, which reconciles directly against NPCI's T+1 cycle data, shows a discrepancy for a subset of these transactions. Specifically, we've flagged 112 transactions amounting to INR 87,450.00 that are missing from the final settlement credit file we received.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, this is a pressing concern. Our internal audit logs are now showing an exception for these transactions, which directly impacts our ability to meet RBI's mandates on timely refund settlement and reporting. As you know, maintaining an immutable and verifiable audit trail is a critical SOC 2 requirement for us.\n\nDigging into our Kibana logs, we can see successful `200 OK` responses from your `/v2/refunds/status` API endpoint for these transaction IDs. However, the payload response appears to be inconsistent with the final settlement status. For instance, `txn_id: FLIPKART_REF_796761_A` was reported as 'PROCESSED' via API at 11:45 PM on June 11, but it never appeared in the subsequent settlement batch from your partner bank. This suggests a potential data sync issue between your application layer and your core banking settlement processor.\n\nThis entire investigation is being tracked under our JIRA ticket PAY-9200. To resolve this, could your engineering team please investigate the data flow for these specific 112 transaction IDs? A confirmation that the UTR numbers were correctly generated and included in the settlement file sent to NPCI would be the first step. If they were missed, we need to understand the root cause to prevent a recurrence.\n\nGiven the compliance implications, we're a bit stressed about getting this closed out.

Building on that analysis, our team has investigated the settlement failures, and we can now confirm the issue is tied to a cross-border payment routing configuration error.\n\nOur analysis of the Kibana logs shows that refunds for transactions made with international cards are not being routed correctly through our system. Instead of being directed to the appropriate cross-border settlement rails, they are being incorrectly pushed towards our domestic NPCI UPI gateway. This is causing an immediate rejection from the gateway and subsequent failure in our T+2 reconciliation cycle. This corroborates the initial hypothesis outlined in Doc#5008057bd56347a3.\n\nThe discrepancy rate is now hovering around 1.3% for the affected cohort, which is a significant operational drag and is triggering persistent alerts on our primary settlement Grafana dashboard. From a compliance perspective, this misrouting is a serious concern, as it creates reporting anomalies that could be flagged in our SOC 2 and RBI audits for cross-border payments.\n\nTechnically, we suspect the issue lies in how the payload is being constructed on Flipkart’s end before calling our `/v2/orders/{order_id}/refunds` endpoint. The `payment_details.country_code` field appears to be defaulting to 'IN' or is null for these transactions, which forces our system to treat them as domestic. Our API expects a non-IN ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code for these refunds to engage the correct processing logic.\n\nTo move forward, could your engineering team please prioritize an investigation into the refund request generation logic for international payments? We need to ensure the correct country context is passed. Our internal ticket for tracking this is JIRA PAY-6486, which is linked to the overall resolution effort for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nWe believe a quick joint debugging session could resolve this faster.

Regarding the issue you acknowledged in email 5008057bd56347a3, our team has completed the root cause analysis for the settlement discrepancy tied to Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nOur investigation points directly to an OAuth 2.0 token refresh failure when our settlement service attempts to communicate with your refund API. Looking at our Grafana dashboards, we saw a clear correlation: P99 latency on the `POST /v1/settlements/refunds` endpoint spiked from our typical ~180ms to over 2.5 seconds. Simultaneously, our Kibana logs showed a surge in `HTTP 408 Request Timeout` errors, which were preceded by `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` responses during the JWT validation step. It seems our service's request to your `/oauth/token` endpoint was failing, causing it to fall back on an expired token, which was then rejected.\n\nThis led to a temporary but significant 4.5% error rate for refund settlements, creating a reconciliation gap that requires manual intervention. The full incident analysis is attached in file#49a3d287719c4892, building on our initial discussion in email#5be432607c354cc1.\n\nAs an immediate mitigation, we manually refreshed the token and executed a rolling restart of the affected pods in our Kubernetes cluster. This restored the service, bringing the error rate back to our standard <0.1% baseline. However, this is obviously not a sustainable solution.\n\nTo prevent a recurrence, we are implementing a more resilient token management strategy on our end, tracked under JIRA PAY-6191. The plan, as outlined in Doc#a4bb7f59cc4540da, includes proactive token refreshes (triggering 10 minutes before expiry) and an enhanced retry mechanism with exponential backoff for the token endpoint.\n\n**Action Item for Flipkart:** Could your team please review the server-side logs for your `/oauth/token` endpoint for the incident window (timestamps in the attached file)? We need to understand if our refresh requests were being rate-limited, throttled, or if there was any performance degradation on your end that we need to account for in our client logic.\n\nEnsuring this is resolved is critical for maintaining our T+1 settlement SLAs and for our audit trails required under RBI guidelines.

Building on your analysis in email a4bb7f59cc4540da, I've done a deeper dive into the Flipkart refund settlement discrepancy, and the situation is a bit more concerning due to the recent PCI audit finding.\n\nThe core of the issue, as tracked in JIRA PAY-6262, stems from a processing mismatch between our system and Flipkart's. Our Kibana logs show a persistent 4.5% error rate on the reconciliation job for Flipkart refunds over the past week. This directly corresponds to late settlement file deliveries via their `refunds/v2/settlement` API endpoint, often occurring outside the agreed T+2 settlement window. Our current reconciliation service, which runs as a batch job on our Kubernetes infrastructure, is timing out before it can ingest these delayed files. This leaves a significant number of transactions (~1,200 in the last 7 days, as per the analysis in file#49a3d287719c4892) in a `refund_processed` state in our system without being marked as `settled`.\n\nFrankly, this is a critical gap. The PCI auditors have flagged this as a failure to comply with PCI DSS Requirement 11.5 (timely detection and response to failures). They've given us a very tight deadline to present a concrete remediation plan, so we need to move quickly on this.\n\nHere’s my proposed two-pronged approach:\n\n**1. Immediate Mitigation & Escalation:**\n*   I will escalate this immediately with our technical account manager at Flipkart. We need to get a clear commitment on their API SLAs and understand why these delays are happening. This isn't sustainable.\n*   Priya, can you please coordinate with the SRE team to temporarily increase the reconciliation job's timeout threshold? Let's bump it from 30 minutes to 60 minutes and monitor the pod's CPU and memory usage via the Grafana dashboard. It’s a band-aid, but it might reduce the immediate backlog.\n\n**2. Long-Term Architectural Fix:**\n*   The batch job is clearly too brittle. We need to re-architect this flow to be asynchronous, which is something we touched upon in a different context (ref: email 5be432607c354cc1). I'm suggesting we implement a Kafka topic to queue the incoming settlement files from Flipkart. A separate consumer service can then process these files, decoupling ingestion from reconciliation.\n*   This approach would make our system resilient to Flipkart's API latency and provide much better observability. We can set alerts for queue length or processing time, allowing us to be proactive rather than reactive.\n\nLet's sync up tomorrow at 11:00 AM IST to finalize the details of the long-term solution before we document it for the auditors. I need both your inputs to ensure the proposed architecture is sound. I'll send out an invite for this meeting shortly.\n\nThis has to be our top priority for the week.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead\nJuspay"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T11:24:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@juspay.in","priya.sharma@juspay.in","aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on your analysis in email ea289a02acfc4e5e, I’ve spent some time correlating the latency spike with our compliance monitoring dashboards, and I have a few concerns I need to raise.\n\nYesterday, between 15:30 and 16:15 IST, our Grafana board for the real-time risk scoring engine showed p99 latency for the `/v2/risk/score` endpoint jumping from a baseline of ~150ms to sustained peaks of over 2.1s, with some requests timing out completely after 2.5s. This directly contributed to a temporary increase in our overall error rate to 0.75% for the Flipkart settlement channel, primarily with `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is quite worrying. A latency of this magnitude means we are failing to apply our complete fraud detection rule-set for a subset of transactions before the upstream service timeout. This creates a potential exposure and deviates from the risk mitigation framework outlined in our last SOC 2 audit. We cannot afford to have these gaps, especially with the transaction volumes we're seeing with Flipkart.\n\nThe log excerpts I've compiled in `file#49a3d287719c4892` appear to rule out issues with the core UPI gateway or NPCI communication. The problem seems localized to the risk engine's data retrieval process, which feels reminiscent of the cache contention issue we tackled last quarter (ref: email#5be432607c354cc1).\n\nThis investigation is being tracked under Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9 and the engineering effort is captured in JIRA PAY-3822.\n\nHere are my immediate action items and asks:\n\n1.  **Engineering (cc: Rohan):** Can we please get a formal RCA that confirms whether this was due to Redis connection pool exhaustion or another infrastructure bottleneck? We need to document this for our next RBI audit cycle.\n\n2.  **Product (cc: Anjali):** We urgently need to define and document a fallback mechanism. If the risk engine times out, what is our default posture? Do we fail-open (approve transaction, accept risk) or fail-close (decline transaction, impact business)? This ambiguity is a significant compliance risk.\n\nI’m available to sync up first thing tomorrow to review the Kibana logs together and finalize the incident report. We need to move quickly on this to ensure our systems remain robust and compliant.\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T11:25:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.gupta@juspay.in","anjali.sharma@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Regarding the refund settlement discrepancy issue, our team has completed a further investigation, and we believe we've isolated the root cause to a performance bottleneck originating from your new core banking system (CBS) integration. This is currently our most critical issue for Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of what our systems are logging:\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show a significant degradation in the performance of your refund reconciliation endpoint post-migration. Specifically, the P99 latency for calls to your API has jumped from a healthy ~250ms to over 2.1s. This is causing a cascade of issues, including a timeout error rate increase from 0.1% to approximately 3.8%. Our Kibana logs (query attached to JIRA PAY-4893) are filled with `504 Gateway Timeout` errors, indicating our system isn't receiving a timely response.\n\nThis latency is severely impacting our automated T+1 settlement process. The reconciliation jobs are failing, which requires manual intervention from our finance operations team and puts us at risk of breaching RBI settlement cycle mandates. We've verified that our end of the OAuth 2.0 flow is functioning correctly; JWT tokens are being generated and presented without issue. The problem seems to lie purely in the server-side processing time on your end after successful authentication.\n\nTo move forward, we have a few urgent requests for your team:\n\n1.  **Investigate the API service layer** that sits between your public-facing endpoints and the new core banking system. The bottleneck likely resides here.\n2.  **Share server-side performance logs** for the specific transaction IDs detailed in the attached analysis (`file#49a3d287719c4892`). This will help us correlate our timeout events with your internal processing times.\n3.  Could you confirm if there are any pending optimizations on the database queries or connection pools for the new CBS? The behavior is consistent with resource contention.\n\nWe need to get ahead of this quickly. The reconciliation failures are creating a growing backlog, and it's becoming a bit stressful to manage manually. Can we schedule a brief, focused technical call tomorrow with your lead engineer on this project? I would like to include my engineering counterpart to align on a concrete resolution plan.\n\nLet me know what time works.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiddharth"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T11:26:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["anjali.verma@flipkart.com","fkt-finance.tech@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"]}},

My findings point to a specific failure pattern in our KYC automation service that seems to be the origin of this issue.\n\nThe discrepancy, as highlighted in the reconciliation report (file#49a3d287719c4892), directly correlates with a spike in KYC validation failures for customers flagged under a 'high-risk' segment. Digging into the Kibana logs for our KYC service, I'm observing a high volume of `422 Unprocessable Entity` responses. This specifically occurs when our system attempts to validate documents for this user cohort, leading to downstream failures in our refund initiation workflow.\n\nTechnically, here's what's happening:\n1.  Our internal refund-processing service fails to get a successful KYC validation before calling Flipkart's `/v2/refunds/initiate` endpoint.\n2.  This prevents us from obtaining a valid `refund_id` from Flipkart, but our internal retry logic incorrectly marks the transaction for settlement reconciliation.\n3.  This creates thousands of 'ghost' refund entries in our T+2 settlement projection, which naturally don't exist in Flipkart's actual settlement file, causing the mismatch.\n\nLooking at our Grafana metrics, the P99 latency for the KYC validation endpoint has jumped from our 450ms baseline to nearly 1.9s, with an error rate peaking at 4.1%. This has impacted approximately 15,000 refund attempts over the past 36 hours. The Kubernetes pods for the KYC service are scaling up to handle the retries, but it's just amplifying the failure rate, not resolving it.\n\nThis is becoming a bit urgent, not just for reconciliation, but for compliance. The lack of a clear success/failure status for these refunds is creating messy audit trails, which could be an issue for our next RBI audit cycle. The logic for handling such edge cases was discussed previously in the thread from a few weeks back (email#5be432607c354cc1).\n\nAction Items & Next Steps:\n\n*   **Immediate Action:** I've updated JIRA PAY-7314 with these technical logs and a detailed failure analysis. I've also slightly tweaked the alerting thresholds on the KYC service to reduce noise for the on-call SREs.\n*   **Backend Team:** We need to prioritize implementing a circuit breaker. If the KYC service returns this specific `422` error, the refund process should halt and move the transaction to a manual review queue instead of retrying indefinitely. This will stop the bleeding.\n*   **Flipkart Inquiry:** Could you or the product team please raise a high-priority ticket with Flipkart's technical team? We need to know if they've recently deployed a change to their risk engine or KYC logic that would explain this sudden shift in behavior. The timing feels too coincidental to be an internal-only issue.\n\nLet's try to get a sync-up call with the Flipkart team by EOD tomorrow to resolve this. The financial impact of the discrepancy is growing.\n\nThanks,\nArjun"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T11:26:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This has become a significant operational bottleneck.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show that our refund reconciliation service is seeing error rates spike to nearly 5.0% during the nightly T+1 settlement window. This is entirely due to `HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)` responses from your `/v2/payments/refund/status` endpoint. While our sustained TPS is steady at ~150, well below the documented limit, the throttling seems to be triggered by brief, high-volume bursts inherent to our batch processing jobs running on our Kubernetes infrastructure. The p99 latency for successful requests remains healthy at ~250ms, but the failed requests are causing a cascade of reconciliation failures.\n\nThe business impact is growing. The discrepancy backlog is now affecting our ability to adhere to RBI's refund TAT guidelines, which is a major compliance concern. Our audit logs, required for SOC 2 compliance, are becoming cluttered with reconciliation retries and failures. We are tracking the resolution internally via JIRA PAY-7836.\n\nFor a short-term fix, could your team please investigate the burst limit configuration for our OAuth 2.0 client ID and consider an immediate, temporary increase? We believe this will unblock our settlement pipeline. Long-term, as I mentioned in our previous discussion (ref: email#5be432607c354cc1), we strongly recommend exploring a bulk status API or a webhook-based notification system. Polling at this scale is inefficient and brittle.\n\nCan you please provide an ETA for the investigation into the rate limits? We need to get this resolved before the next settlement cycle to avoid compounding the issue.\n\nAppreciate your urgent help on this.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjali Patel"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T11:27:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@flipkart.com"],"cc":["priya.s@juspay.in","payments-eng@flipkart.com","settlements-team@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Your findings on the routing logic misconfiguration align with what I'm seeing from a compliance and risk standpoint. This cross-border payment routing error has some significant regulatory implications we need to address urgently.\n\nI've spent the morning digging through Kibana logs for the incident window, specifically filtering for `merchant_id:flipkart` and `event_type:refund_settlement_failure`. The pattern is quite clear: our settlement orchestrator was incorrectly routing these refunds through an international gateway, causing Flipkart's settlement API to reject them with `ERROR_CODE: 422_INVALID_CURRENCY_CODE`. The volume is concerning – we’re looking at approximately 15,000 transactions that failed settlement.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is a major red flag. These failed transactions are not being captured in our automated SAR (Suspicious Activity Reporting) pre-screening and are creating a discrepancy in the T+1 settlement report for our partner bank. This directly impacts our adherence to RBI's guidelines on payment settlements and could be flagged in our next SOC 2 audit. The core issue seems to be the new routing rules engine deployed last Tuesday, as referenced in the initial report (email#5be432607c354cc1).\n\nThe good news is that our OAuth 2.0 authentication flow with Flipkart seems stable, and JWT token validation is passing, so the issue is isolated post-auth. The Grafana dashboard \"Flipkart-Settlement-Performance\" confirms this, showing our P99 latency for the `/v2/refunds/settle` endpoint spiking to over 2.5s before timing out, and the error rate jumping from a baseline of 0.2% to 4.5%.\n\nI've attached my detailed findings to JIRA PAY-9660 and linked the raw data export (file#49a3d287719c4892) for the engineering team.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Aditya):** Can you confirm that the proposed hotfix specifically forces the currency code to 'INR' for all domestic Flipkart refunds? We also need to ensure the fix adds enhanced audit logging for the routing decision logic itself, capturing the `rule_id` and `selected_gateway`. This is critical for future audit trails.\n2.  **Compliance (Myself):** I will begin the manual reconciliation process for the impacted transactions and prepare a draft of the internal incident report for the risk committee.\n\nMy main concern is getting this resolved before our weekly regulatory reporting deadline on Friday. Could we schedule a quick 15-minute call tomorrow morning to align on the deployment plan for the fix to the staging environment? We'll need to coordinate with Flipkart to get their sign-off for re-processing the failed batch.\n\nThis is our top priority for the week.

It was crucial for our investigation.\n\nOur engineering and finance teams have completed a root cause analysis for the settlement discrepancy highlighted in Work ID 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9. We've pinpointed the issue to a misconfiguration in our payment routing logic for specific cross-border transactions.\n\n**Technical Root Cause:**\nThe issue originated in our settlement orchestrator service. A recently deployed routing rule change inadvertently caused refund requests for transactions made with certain international BINs to be processed as domestic refunds. This led to an incorrect currency and fee calculation, resulting in the T+2 settlement mismatches you reported. Our Kibana logs confirm this, showing a spike in `error.code:INVALID_COUNTRY_CODE` for the refund processing workflow, which was being masked by a downstream retry mechanism. We were seeing P99 latencies on the `/v1/settlement/process` endpoint jump from our usual ~450ms to nearly 2.2s for the affected batch.\n\n**Impact Analysis:**\nBased on the transaction list you provided and our internal Grafana dashboards, we've identified 1,428 refund transactions processed between Tuesday and Wednesday that were impacted. The total discrepancy amounts to ₹1,84,350. This is a significant variance, and frankly, it's a bit frustrating that our alerting thresholds didn't catch this specific edge case sooner. We're tuning them now to prevent a recurrence.\n\n**Resolution and Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Hotfix (Completed):** Our SRE team has already rolled back the problematic configuration in the production environment. All new refund requests are now being routed correctly. We're monitoring the settlement dashboard closely, and error rates have returned to the baseline of <0.1%.\n2.  **Reconciliation (In Progress):** Our finance team is conducting a manual reconciliation of the 1,428 affected transactions. We are using the data from file#49a3d287719c4892 as the source of truth. We will process a bulk credit adjustment to cover the shortfall in the next settlement cycle, scheduled for tomorrow, EOD.\n3.  **Permanent Fix (JIRA PAY-2537):** To prevent this from ever happening again, we're implementing a stricter validation layer at the API gateway level. Any refund request with a cross-border `payment_context` will now require an explicit `merchant_country_code` field, which will be cross-referenced before hitting the settlement orchestrator. This work is being tracked under JIRA PAY-2537 and is slated for our next sprint release. This also aligns with the discussion we had in the context of email#5be432607c354cc1 regarding PCI DSS 4.0 compliance.\n\nI've attached a preliminary report of the affected transaction IDs for your team's verification. Please let me know if you foresee any issues with the proposed bulk credit adjustment.\n\nWe take these discrepancies very seriously, especially given the RBI compliance context for cross-border payments. I'd like to schedule a brief 15-minute call early next week to confirm resolution and walk through the preventative measures in PAY-2537.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiddharth Nair\nVendor Success Manager\nJuspay"],"timestamp":"2025-09-15T11:28:00","app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@flipkart.com","finance.ops@flipkart.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

The new fraud model (v2.3) deployed yesterday for Flipkart refunds is causing a significant spike in false positives. Our overnight Euler ledger reconciliation job failed, flagging a large number of discrepancies, and the manual review queue is completely backed up. We need to decide on a course of action ASAP.\n\nI've linked the Grafana dashboard in the invite. Post-deployment of `deploy-id-fde-v2.3`, we saw transactions with `errorCode: FRD_401_HIGH_RISK` jump from a baseline of ~0.5% to 3.8% specifically for the Flipkart-refund processor. This seems to be the root cause. Kibana logs for the affected `transaction_ids` show the model is assigning abnormally high risk scores based on criteria that weren't an issue in v2.2. Rohan, maybe you can shed some light on this during the call?\n\nMy primary proposal is an immediate, temporary rollback. I have already staged a job to toggle the feature flag `FLIPKART_FRAUD_MODEL_V2_3_ENABLED` to `false`, which will revert us to the stable v2.2 model. This should bring the false positive rate back to baseline within minutes and unblock the settlement process. The main agenda for this meeting is to get alignment on this action and define next steps.\n\nProposed Agenda:\n1. Quick confirmation of the impact analysis.\n2. GO/NO-GO decision on the immediate rollback to v2.2.\n3. Assign owner for deep-dive RCA on the v2.3 model's behavior.\n4.

Thanks for the quick debugging on Slack. It looks like we've confirmed the root cause is the OAuth token refresh mechanism in our `auth-service-v2` failing intermittently under specific load conditions, leading to `401 Unauthorized` errors when the `settlement-reconciliation-job` calls Flipkart's `/refund/status` API.\n\nOur Grafana dashboard (link attached in Confluence) clearly shows a correlation between the spike in 401s and the timing of the settlement file discrepancies. The current logic has a race condition where a token can expire just before the refresh cycle is triggered, especially during peak batch processing. This is causing ~1.5% of refund status checks to fail, which directly impacts our Euler ledger reconciliation accuracy.\n\nProposed Agenda:\n1.  **Confirm RCA:** Quick final validation of the race condition theory. (5 mins)\n2.  **Solution Deep-Dive:** Discuss two proposed hotfixes:\n    a) Proactive Refresh: Implement a scheduler to refresh the token 5 mins *before* its official expiry.\n    b) Resilient Retry with new token: Enhance the retry logic in the settlement job to explicitly request a new token on a 401 error, instead of a simple backoff.\n3.  **Decision & Ownership:** Agree on the path forward, considering implementation effort vs. long-term stability. Assign owners for the code change (PR), QA, and deployment.\n4.  **Deployment & Rollback:** Define the deployment plan (canary vs. full) and criteria for a potential rollback.\n\nGoal is to leave this meeting with a concrete action plan and ETAs documented in PAY-6982. Rishi (Flipkart), can you confirm if there are any rate limits on your end for token generation that we should be aware of for option 2b?

The goal here is to agree on the root cause and lock down immediate remediation steps for the Flipkart refund settlement issue. Please review the linked Confluence page for a summary of the investigation so far.\n\nOur analysis points to a misconfiguration in the cross-border payment routing rules, deployed with ID `d-gama789b`, which incorrectly excluded a set of international BINs. The Kibana dashboard 'Refund_Processor_Errors' confirms a spike in `ERR_ROUTING_NO_VALID_PROCESSOR` codes starting right after the deployment. This has impacted approximately 1.2% of Flipkart's cross-border refunds over the last 72 hours, resulting in the ~₹45 Lakhs discrepancy Vikram’s team flagged in the Euler ledger reconciliation reports.\n\nProposed next steps for discussion and sign-off:\n1.  **Immediate Hotfix:** Rahul V. to revert the specific routing rule configmap in the payment-orchestration-service. We need a PR for this within the next 2 hours for immediate peer review and deployment. ETA for production fix: EOD Today.\n2.  **Manual Reconciliation:** Vikram R. and Rohan G. (Flipkart) to collaborate on a manual settlement file for the failed refunds. Vikram, can you provide an ETA for when we can expect the final discrepancy report to share with Flipkart's finance team?\n3.  **Preventative Action:** Priya S. to create a follow-up story for implementing stricter schema validation on our routing configuration pipeline. This should prevent similar typos or logical errors in the future. We can't have this happen again.\n4.  **Compliance Review:** Anjali D. to provide a quick review of the manual reconciliation process to ensure it aligns with our reporting obligations. A simple sign-off on the Confluence page will suffice.\n\nLet's get alignment on this so we can execute quickly.

The current JDBC connection pool, configured with `max_connections=50` via our Spring Boot application.yml, is being fully exhausted as threads are blocked on I/O wait, preventing the timely generation of the final settlement file for Flipkart.","The root cause is the synchronous, single-threaded nature of the legacy CBS query module within our batch processor. It executes a series of complex joins to reconcile refund statuses against payment captures, a process that is now contending for resources with the migration's high-volume read operations. This resource contention is causing a significant lag in the `flipkart_refund_ack` Kafka topic, with the consumer group lag exceeding our 5000-message alert threshold as seen in the Grafana dashboard. Consequently, settlement files are being delivered to Flipkart's SFTP server 45-60 minutes past the agreed SLA, leading to reconciliation mismatches on their end.","Immediate mitigation involves isolating the settlement workload. I recommend deploying a dedicated read-replica of the legacy Oracle DB, accessible only by the `refund-settlement-batch` service, and increasing its connection pool to `max_connections=100`. For a permanent fix, we must refactor the batch job. The reconciliation logic should be decoupled by creating a new microservice that subscribes to the CBS change data capture (CDC) streams (via Debezium) and populates a denormalized view in our operational PostgreSQL cluster. The settlement job will then query this pre-aggregated, low-latency data source, eliminating the direct dependency on the live, high-contention CBS during the critical settlement window."],"owner":"Arjun Mehta","ownerEmail":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","photoLink":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/photo8","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arjun.mehta@juspay.in","tech-leads@juspay.in","product-team@juspay.in","compliance@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"application/json","createdAt":1757917380000,"updatedAt":1757917380000}},

This has led to a 22% increase in HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout errors originating from their perimeter, which then manifest as `NPCI-U69` (Request Timeout) responses in our system, triggering expensive and delayed reconciliation cycles via our Kafka-based settlement streams.","As an immediate containment measure, I am implementing a dynamic circuit breaker pattern using Resilience4j within our 'upi-connector' microservice. The breaker will be configured to trip if more than 40% of requests within a 30-second sliding window exceed a 2-second response time threshold. This will prevent cascading failures and thread exhaustion in our service fleet. Additionally, I have submitted a configuration change to increase the read timeout on the Apache HTTP client pool dedicated to ICICI from 2500ms to 4000ms.

Your analysis in file 9499d75846634fe7 confirms what our monitoring dashboards have been screaming since ICICI's core banking system (CBS) migration over the weekend.\n\nTo summarize for everyone on the thread, we are seeing a critical performance bottleneck specifically with the ICICI UPI AutoPay mandate creation flow. This directly impacts Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001.\n\nHere are the key metrics from our Grafana UPI dashboard (I've linked it in JIRA PAY-6017):\n\n*   **P99 Latency:** The response time for the `/mandate/create` endpoint has surged from a stable ~280ms to over 2.1s, with frequent timeouts exceeding 3s.\n*   **Error Rate:** We've seen a jump in failure rates from 0.2% to 4.5%, predominantly NPCI error code `U30` (Transaction timed out at Bank). Kibana logs confirm the requests are reaching the ICICI gateway but are not getting a response from their backend within the stipulated window.\n*   **Transaction Throughput:** Our TPS for mandate creation with ICICI has dropped by nearly 60% during peak hours, which is simply unacceptable.\n\nOur engineering team has already verified that our infrastructure is not the cause. Our Kubernetes cluster scaled appropriately, the OAuth 2.0 token exchange with ICICI is healthy (<50ms), and our internal processing and JWT signing are nominal. All signs point to a processing bottleneck within their newly migrated CBS.\n\nThis puts us in a difficult position, both with our merchants who rely on this for subscriptions and from a compliance standpoint regarding mandate processing timelines set by RBI. The current performance is a clear violation of the 99.9% uptime SLA we have in our agreement.\n\nI've had a preliminary conversation with our counterparts at ICICI, and while they've acknowledged the issue verbally, we need to provide them with concrete data to escalate this internally on their side. \n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Priya:** Can you please collate the specific Kibana log excerpts showing the timeout patterns and package them with the Grafana dashboard snapshots from the last 48 hours?

This PCI finding is absolutely critical and has my full attention.\n\nI've reviewed the preliminary audit report (file#9499d75846634fe7) and synced with Priya's team. The issue stems from our UPI gateway's logging layer for the ICICI integration; specifically, it's capturing and persisting unmasked fragments of the OAuth 2.0 access token during the mandate creation handshake via the `/icici/v1/mandates/create` endpoint. This is a clear and serious violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 concerning the protection of sensitive authentication data, and we need to move on this immediately.\n\nI’ve pulled the Kibana logs for our `icici-upi-connector` service from the past 48 hours, and it looks like this affects all mandate creation calls originating from our primary Kubernetes cluster. The good news, if any, is that it hasn't introduced any performance degradation—our Grafana dashboard shows P99 latency holding steady at ~450ms and the error rate is well below our 0.5% threshold.

Building on the analysis from email 5503cdf1e2d44df7, the situation with the ICICI UPI AutoPay mandate integration has unfortunately not improved. I'm getting a bit stressed as we are continuing to see significant timeouts, and the impact is now escalating.\n\nOur internal investigation has definitively isolated the issue to the OAuth token refresh flow on ICICI's end. Here’s a summary of our findings:\n\n1.  **Performance Metrics:** Our Grafana monitoring shows P99 latency for the mandate creation endpoint (`/upi/mandate/v3/create`) spiking from a baseline of ~350ms to over 2,800ms. The error rate for transactions routed to ICICI has jumped from 0.3% to a sustained 4.2% since yesterday afternoon. This is a clear violation of our 99.9% uptime SLA.\n\n2.  **Root Cause:** A deep dive into our Kibana logs indicates that our UPI gateway's requests to ICICI's `/oauth/token` endpoint are timing out when using the `refresh_token` grant type. The initial token generation works, but subsequent refreshes fail intermittently with a connection timeout error. This suggests a potential issue with their token service liveness or an unannounced rate limiter on their side.\n\n3.  **System Health:** We have confirmed no deployments or configuration changes were made to our Kubernetes services handling this integration. All other banking partner integrations are operating within normal parameters. The issue is exclusively with the ICICI connection for Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001.\n\nI've raised this as a critical incident under JIRA PAY-7111 and have formally escalated it to our contacts at ICICI Bank, referencing our discussion from email d7e5b68d3dd54ffc.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **ICICI Team (Owner: Rohan @ ICICI):** Investigate the server-side logs for the `/oauth/token` service for requests from our client ID.

Building on your initial findings in email bcb2d4ba9d0e4df9, I've investigated the spike in failed cross-border mandates for the ICICI UPI AutoPay integration.\n\nThe root cause appears to be a misconfiguration in the routing logic within our `upi-autopay-gateway` service. After reviewing the Kibana logs (filtering for NRE/NRO account types), it's clear that mandate requests from international BINs are being incorrectly routed to a domestic-only processing endpoint at ICICI's end. Our Grafana dashboard, 'UPI Mandate - Transaction Health,' confirms a 4.8% error rate for this specific cohort, with p99 latency spiking from our usual ~250ms to over 2.5s before timing out.\n\nICICI's system is correctly rejecting these with a generic 'Invalid Transaction Origin' message, which aligns with NPCI error code `U30`. This is a clear violation of the transaction flow defined in our technical spec, Doc#82405c07285b4c3f, and has direct implications for our RBI compliance reporting. I’ve attached a full log trace in `file#9499d75846634fe7` and updated the JIRA ticket PAY-4369 with these findings.\n\nI have already prepared and tested a hotfix.

The finding directly impacts our ability to go live and is tracked internally as JIRA PAY-3989. The specific issue is a violation of PCI DSS Requirement 8.5.1, which pertains to the secure management of authentication tokens.\n\nThe JWTs being issued by your `/token` endpoint are missing the mandatory `aud` (audience) claim. As per our security framework and standard OAuth 2.0 best practices, this claim is essential for our gateway to verify that the token was issued specifically for Juspay's services. Without this, our token validation service, which runs as a sidecar in our Kubernetes cluster, is rejecting all tokens from your UAT environment. You can see this clearly in the Kibana logs I've filtered for the integration service, which show a 100% failure rate at the validation stage despite a successful API call to the token endpoint.\n\nOur Grafana monitoring confirms that the issue isn't performance-related; P99 latency for the `/token` endpoint is stable at a respectable 215ms. The problem is purely a security and compliance one. This was also highlighted in our internal security review (ref: email d7e5b68d3dd54ffc) and the attached audit report excerpt (file#9499d75846634fe7).\n\nThis is unfortunately a blocker for us.

We're observing a persistent failure rate of around 12-15% for mandate creation requests within our high-risk customer segments. Our Grafana dashboard (ICICI-Mandate-Health) clearly shows a spike in timeouts originating from the pre-mandate e-KYC verification step.\n\nDrilling down with Kibana, the issue seems isolated to API calls made to your `/v2/customer/ekyc/validate` endpoint. We're consistently receiving `HTTP 503 Service Unavailable` responses and, more frequently, client-side timeouts after our configured 2.5-second threshold. The p99 latency for this specific API call has degraded from a healthy ~450ms to over 2.3s during business hours, which strongly suggests a bottleneck. This unfortunately reminds me of the early performance concerns Priya raised during UAT, as noted in email thread d7e5b68d3dd54ffc.\n\nWe've done our due diligence on our side:\n1.  Our Kubernetes pods handling the egress traffic show no resource contention (CPU is under 40%, memory stable).\n2.  We've confirmed the integrity of the request payloads. The PAN/Aadhaar data for failed transactions, cross-referenced with the sample list in file 9499d75846634fe7, is correctly formatted and valid.\n3.  Our JWT token generation and OAuth 2.0 flow are functioning correctly, with no authentication-related errors logged.\n\nThis is escalating into a significant operational problem for us. The required manual fallback for KYC is not scalable and is starting to jeopardize our T+1 settlement SLA for several key merchants. More critically, we are concerned about staying fully compliant with RBI's e-mandate guidelines if this persists. I've attached a detailed log export and a list of failed transaction IDs to JIRA ticket PAY-2048 for your reference.\n\nTo move forward, could your team please help us with the following?\n\n*   Can you investigate the application and server logs for your `/v2/customer/ekyc/validate` service corresponding to the transaction IDs in PAY-2048? We suspect there might be a downstream dependency or database query that's timing out under load.\n*   Could you confirm the designated TPS limits for our client ID? We need to know if we are inadvertently triggering a rate-limiter, although we aren't receiving the typical `429 Too Many Requests` status code.\n\nGiven the urgency, I believe a quick sync call between our respective engineering leads would be the most efficient path to a resolution. Would someone from your team be available for a 30-minute call tomorrow or Friday?\n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed.

My investigation confirms the auditor's finding: our server-to-server JWTs used for authentication against ICICI's API gateway have an excessively long lifespan (24 hours), which is a clear violation of PCI DSS Requirement 8.2.4 regarding identifier lifecycle management. Furthermore, our current implementation lacks an immediate revocation mechanism, which poses a significant risk if a token were to be compromised.\n\nI’ve traced the root cause to a configuration oversight in our `icici-autopay-connector` service deployed on Kubernetes. We seem to have used a default setting from our internal OAuth 2.0 client library and did not implement the token revocation list that was specified in the initial technical spec (Doc#b370fd879ad04fdf). I've updated the context in JIRA PAY-4923 with these findings.\n\nHere is my proposed remediation plan, which I'm already working on:\n\n1.  **Reduce Token Expiry:** I will modify the token issuance logic to set the JWT expiry to 1 hour.

The change will also include a proactive refresh mechanism that triggers 10 minutes before expiry to ensure zero downtime or added latency to mandate creation calls, which are currently stable with a P99 latency of 220ms.\n\n2.  **Implement Token Revocation:** I will introduce a Redis-based blocklist for immediate token revocation. The JWT ID (`jti`) of any token that needs to be voided will be pushed to a Redis set. Our central API gateway middleware will be updated to check against this set for every request, effectively providing a near-real-time revocation capability. This ensures we can respond swiftly to any potential security incidents.\n\n**Impact & Monitoring:**\nThese changes are confined to the auth layer and will not affect the core transaction flow. Post-deployment, I will be monitoring our 'UPI Mandate Auth' Grafana dashboard for any anomalies, specifically watching the 4xx error rate panel. I have also configured a new alert that will trigger if the token validation success rate drops below 99.95% for more than a minute. I'll verify the new token expiry via Kibana queries on the connector service logs.\n\n**Action Items & Timeline:**\n*   **My Action:** I will have the code changes implemented in a feature branch and a PR raised for review by 4 PM today.\n*   **My Action:** I will deploy the changes to our UAT environment for end-to-end testing by 7 PM today.\n*   **Request for Security Team:** Sameer, could you or someone from your team please review the PR and validate the fix in UAT tomorrow morning? Your sign-off is the final gate for production deployment.\n\nPending your approval, I am targeting a production rollout during the low-traffic window tomorrow night (around 2 AM IST). This should give us enough time to provide the compliance team with evidence of remediation before their deadline.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or concerns about this approach.\n\nRegards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer"],"timestamp":1757913180000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["sameer.verma@juspay.in","aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on the analysis from your email (b370fd879ad04fdf), I wanted to add some business context and technical concerns regarding the multi-currency settlement requirement for the ICICI UPI AutoPay Integration.\n\nAs you know, this feature is a critical blocker for two of our large international merchants. The core of the problem, as detailed in Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001, is that our current T+1 settlement process with ICICI is strictly for INR transactions. Their current file-based settlement API seems to lack the fields for currency codes and exchange rates, which is a major gap.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, I have a few concerns that we need to address urgently:\n\n1.  **API Capability:** The current `/settlement` endpoint specification from ICICI does not support multi-currency batches. Their last communication (ref: email d7e5b68d3dd54ffc) was unfortunately vague. We need to confirm if they plan to introduce a new version of the API or if we need to build a complex workaround involving separate settlement accounts, which would be an operational nightmare and likely violate RBI's FEMA guidelines on nostro/vostro account reconciliation.\n\n2.  **Performance Impact:** Our mandate creation and execution APIs are currently operating well within SLA, with a p99 latency of around 280ms for mandate debit calls. Introducing a real-time FX rate lookup service mid-transaction could add significant latency. We need to model this carefully to ensure we don't breach our 500ms threshold, which could lead to higher drop-off rates, as seen on our Grafana dashboards.\n\n3.  **Reconciliation & Compliance:** Our internal reconciliation engine will require a significant overhaul. I've updated JIRA PAY-2569 with the initial requirements draft (file#9499d75846634fe7). We need to ensure that every cross-currency transaction is auditable and compliant with SOC 2 requirements for financial reporting. Any discrepancy here would be a red flag for our auditors.\n\n4.  **Authentication Scopes:** Does the current OAuth 2.0 implementation with ICICI provide JWT tokens with the necessary scopes to access their forex rates API, if one even exists? This was not covered in our initial integration discussions.\n\nI'm getting a bit antsy as the business pressure is mounting. We can't afford delays on this integration.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Aditya (You):** Could you please have your team investigate the feasibility and level-of-effort required to adapt our settlement service for multi-currency ledgers? A high-level estimate by Friday EOD would be extremely helpful.\n*   **Rohit (Me):** I will escalate this with our counterparts at ICICI Bank and push for a definitive answer on their API roadmap by tomorrow. I'm aiming to get a concrete response, not just another holding email.\n\nLet's connect for 15 minutes tomorrow to sync up on this. We need a clear path forward before our next weekly review.\n\nBest,\n\nRohit Sharma\nBusiness Development Manager, Juspay"],"timestamp":1757913420000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh@juspay.in","priya.mehra@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"]}},

Building on your summary in email 4f7b69dca93e4bde, we've continued our investigation into the elevated failure rates for the UPI AutoPay mandate creation.\n\nUnfortunately, the situation has become more critical over the past 24 hours. Our primary Grafana dashboard for the ICICI integration is now showing a mandate failure rate of 4.2%, a significant deviation from the expected baseline of <1%. The vast majority of these failures are returning the API error code `FRM707 - 'Transaction Flagged by Risk Module'`, which points directly to your internal fraud detection system.\n\nOur lead engineer, Anjali, has completed a thorough review of the transaction logs in Kibana for the affected period. We have sampled over 500 failed transaction IDs and confirmed that the request payloads being sent from our Kubernetes cluster to your `/mandate/create` endpoint are fully compliant with the API specifications documented in `file#9499d75846634fe7`. We can't identify any anomalies or deviations on our side. The OAuth 2.0 JWT tokens are being generated and passed correctly, and API latency on our end remains stable at a p99 of 180ms.\n\nThis high false-positive rate is becoming a major blocker for the project (Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001) and is negatively impacting the user experience, directly contradicting the streamlined flow mandated by NPCI guidelines. We've escalated this internally and are tracking it with high priority under JIRA PAY-8640.\n\nCould your team please conduct an urgent review of the fraud engine's rule set? It appears to be calibrated too aggressively for this use case, incorrectly flagging legitimate, low-risk mandate creation requests. To facilitate your investigation, we can provide a list of affected Juspay Transaction IDs and the corresponding timestamps.\n\nTo move forward, I propose a technical call early next week with your risk/fraud engine team and our payment gateway engineers.

Building on the analysis from your email ac6bfbe349f24833 regarding the core banking system (CBS) migration, our team has been closely monitoring the performance of the ICICI UPI AutoPay Mandate integration (Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001).\n\nUnfortunately, we've identified a significant performance bottleneck that's impacting mandate creation success rates. Our Grafana dashboards are showing a sharp increase in p99 latency for the `/mandate/create` API endpoint. Pre-migration, we were consistently seeing response times around the 450ms mark; however, since Monday, these have been spiking to over 2.5s during your peak processing hours (11 AM - 3 PM IST). This is well outside the 800ms SLA we agreed upon in the initial spec document (file#9499d75846634fe7).\n\nThis latency increase is directly contributing to a higher timeout rate, which has climbed from a baseline of 0.2% to an alarming 4.1%. Digging into our Kibana logs, we are primarily seeing `504 Gateway Timeout` responses, which our system interprets as a failure on the bank's end to process the request in time. We've consolidated our internal findings and are tracking this under JIRA ticket PAY-7379. Our hypothesis is that the new CBS infrastructure may be facing resource contention or requires further tuning, as the issue seems correlated with high transaction volumes.\n\nFrom our perspective, this is becoming a critical issue. The elevated failure rate not only creates a poor experience for our merchants and their customers but also puts us at risk of non-compliance with RBI's e-mandate success rate guidelines. As you know, maintaining an uptime SLA of 99.9% is paramount for this service.\n\nTo address this with the urgency it requires, could you please initiate the following actions?\n\n1.  **Internal Investigation:** Have your infrastructure and CBS teams investigate the application and database server logs for the period corresponding to our observed latency spikes. Specifically, we'd be interested in CPU/memory utilization on the Kubernetes pods servicing these API requests.\n2.  **Joint Debugging Session:** We'd like to schedule a joint technical call with our SRE team lead, Aditya Singh (CC'd), and your CBS engineering counterparts to trace a few failed transaction IDs and review the end-to-end flow. Please let us know your availability for tomorrow or Friday.\n3.  **Share Benchmarks:** Could you share the post-migration load testing results and the new expected TPS/latency benchmarks for the production environment?\n\nGetting ahead of this is my top priority.

Building on the initial analysis in your email (381a065e78b24a15), my team and I have completed a root cause analysis for the intermittent API timeouts impacting the ICICI UPI AutoPay Mandate Integration (Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001).\n\nThe issue, as suspected, is tied to the OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow with ICICI's authentication server. During peak transaction windows, we observed a 4.2% error rate, primarily consisting of `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors. Our P99 latency for the mandate creation endpoint spiked from a baseline of ~350ms to over 2.5s, which is a clear breach of our internal SLA and negatively impacts user experience.\n\n**Technical Root Cause:**\nAfter correlating Kibana logs with our Grafana metrics for the UPI gateway, we've determined the failure originates when our service attempts to refresh an expiring JWT. The core problem is two-fold:\n\n1.  **Reactive Refresh Logic:** Our current implementation waits for a `401 Unauthorized` response before initiating a token refresh. This is inefficient and introduces latency.\n2.  **Upstream Latency:** ICICI's `/oauth/token` endpoint is exhibiting inconsistent response times. Our monitoring shows it occasionally taking >2000ms to respond, which exceeds our client-side timeout of 1500ms. This causes our refresh attempt to fail, leading to a cascade of failed mandate API calls (`/mandates/v1/create`) that were queued behind it.\n\nI've attached a log export (see file#9499d75846634fe7) with trace IDs from yesterday's incident that clearly demonstrates this pattern.\n\n**Mitigation and Next Steps (JIRA: PAY-9452):**\n\n1.  **Immediate Hotfix (Deployed to Staging):** I have deployed a proactive token refresh mechanism. Our mandate service will now automatically initiate a refresh 5 minutes before the token's expiry. This preemptive action should prevent the pile-up of requests and eliminate the `401`-driven refresh cycle. We are currently load-testing this in staging and initial results show P99 latency is back below 400ms with a near-zero error rate.\n\n2.  **Long-Term Solution:** To prevent race conditions across our Kubernetes cluster, we will implement a distributed lock using our existing Redis infrastructure for the token refresh process. This ensures only one pod handles the refresh, and the new token is propagated to all other instances. This approach is more resilient and aligns with our SOC 2 audit requirements for credential management.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Juspay DevOps (Owner: Arjun Mehta):** Complete staging validation of the hotfix by EOD today. Plan for a production rollout during the next maintenance window (Thursday, 3:00 AM IST).\n*   **ICICI Team (Action For):** Could you please investigate the latency spikes on the `/oauth/token` endpoint from your end? Having a clear SLA on its P99 response time would be extremely helpful for us to fine-tune our timeouts and prevent future occurrences. The previous email (d7e5b68d3dd54ffc) from your team suggested a sub-500ms response time, which we are clearly not seeing consistently.\n\nWe are treating this with urgency, as mandate creation is a critical flow.

This issue is becoming a bit of a bottleneck for us, and the reconciliation effort is growing.\n\nOur engineering team has correlated our transaction logs against the settlement data provided in file#9499d75846634fe7. We can confirm through our Kibana logs that we are receiving a successful acknowledgment from the NPCI gateway for these transactions via your API endpoints. However, they are consistently missing from the settlement batch.\n\nFor a concrete example, transaction ID `JPAYMNDT_8819034` with RRN `135792468012` was successfully executed at 11:45 AM IST yesterday, with latency well within our 99th percentile SLA of 800ms. Our Grafana dashboard confirms the successful API response. Despite this, the transaction was absent from the subsequent settlement file. This is not an isolated incident; we have documented over 200 such cases in the last 24 hours alone, all tracked under JIRA PAY-5397.\n\nThis mismatch is creating significant operational overhead and has the potential to violate RBI's prescribed TAT for merchant settlements. To move forward, we need your team to investigate the post-NPCI confirmation flow on your side.

Our primary Grafana dashboard for this integration is showing the error rate for this specific cohort jumping from a stable baseline of ~0.5% to a sustained 4.8% over the last four hours. This is a major deviation and is impacting a significant volume of our users.\n\nFrom our Kibana logs, we've identified that your `/v2/upi/mandate/create` endpoint is consistently returning a generic `GW_TRANSACTION_REJECTED` error with the internal bank response code `U16` ('KYC Validation Failed'). We are not receiving any more granular error messages that would help us debug this from our side. The OAuth 2.0 handshake completes successfully, and the JWT token appears valid, so we don't suspect an authentication issue. P99 latency for these failed requests is also climbing, now averaging 2.1s, likely due to timeouts on your end.\n\nThis is creating a bit of a difficult situation for us, as it not only impacts the user experience but also creates a potential compliance gap with RBI's e-mandate and KYC guidelines.

Transaction Per Second (TPS) rates were nominal during this period, holding steady around 12k, which rules out a traffic-induced bottleneck on our end. Our overall mandate creation error rate remained low at ~0.2%, so transactions were succeeding, just experiencing significant delays.\n\nPriya from our infrastructure team correlated our Kibana logs with the API gateway traces. We're observing the delay between our call to ICICI's `/initiateMandate` endpoint and receiving the acknowledgment. The processing time within our Kubernetes pods is nominal, and there are no signs of network saturation on our side. This strongly suggests the latency is originating from the processing on ICICI's end after the request is received.\n\nThis is becoming a bit of a concern as it pushes our overall transaction processing time close to the NPCI timeout threshold.

The requests are correctly formed and dispatched from our end.\n\n2.  **Error Patterns:** We are receiving a generic `GW-503 (Service Unavailable)` error from ICICI's `/upi/v2/mandate` endpoint. However, drilling down into the underlying NPCI response code, we are seeing a consistent `U30` (Transaction not permitted by rule) error. This strongly suggests a business rule or firewall policy issue at their gateway, not a technical failure.\n\n3.  **Performance Metrics:** Our Grafana dashboard shows the error rate for this specific transaction type has spiked to 12.5% over the last 24 hours. The P99 latency for these failed transactions is exceeding 2.2 seconds before timeout, which is impacting our overall gateway performance metrics.\n\n4.  **Authentication Verified:** I've confirmed that our OAuth 2.0 client credential flow is stable and the JWT tokens are being generated and signed correctly. The issue is occurring post-authentication, which rules out any problems with our security implementation.\n\nThis behavior directly contradicts the cross-border transaction capabilities that were confirmed in our joint technical call on May 15th (referencing discussion in email#d7e5b68d3dd54ffc).

The issue appears to be a critical cross-border payment routing configuration error on our side, and we're treating this with high priority. This is being tracked internally under JIRA PAY-7529.\n\nHere’s a summary of our findings:\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\nOur Grafana dashboards for the UPI gateway show a sharp increase in transaction failures, peaking at a 4.5% error rate starting around 09:15 AM IST. The primary error code we're seeing from the NPCI network is `U91 - Invalid Transaction Type`. Kibana logs confirm these failures are isolated to mandate execution requests for a subset of merchants whose MCCs are being incorrectly flagged as requiring cross-border processing.\n\nOur hypothesis, which aligns with the analysis from email d7e5b68d3dd54ffc, points to a stale configuration map within our Kubernetes deployment. This seems to be causing our payment orchestration layer to incorrectly apply FEMA/RBI compliance flags to these domestic transactions, leading to their rejection by the ICICI bank switch or NPCI before they can be processed. The average p99 latency for these failed API calls is hitting 2.1s, far above our 272ms baseline.\n\n**Compliance & Business Impact:**\nWhile the transactions are failing and no funds are being incorrectly routed, the mis-flagging itself is a compliance concern we need to rectify immediately. This is also impacting the user experience for our mutual merchants and skewing our success rate metrics for the new integration.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n1.  **[Juspay Engineering - Owner: Aditya]** Aditya's team is currently forcing a refresh of the routing configuration in our staging environment, using the updated logic specified in Doc#9499d75846634fe7. We expect to have validation results within the next hour.\n2.  **[ICICI Bank - Owner: Priya]** Priya, could your team please check your gateway logs for transaction requests from us between 09:00 and 11:30 AM IST today? It would be extremely helpful to confirm if you are seeing these requests arrive with an incorrect country code or international transaction flag. This will help us confirm our diagnosis before pushing a hotfix.\n3.  **[Juspay - Target: EOD]** Contingent on successful staging tests and your confirmation, we are preparing an emergency deployment to production. Our goal is to have the fix live by 6 PM IST to restore normal service levels.\n\nThis is obviously not the smooth launch we were hoping for, and I apologize for the disruption. We are confident we have isolated the root cause. Let's sync up for a quick 15-minute call at 3:00 PM IST to align on the findings before we proceed with the production deployment.\n\nI will send the meeting invite shortly.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRohit Sharma"],"timestamp":1757915160000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["priya.mehta@icicibank.com","aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Regarding the preliminary analysis you shared in email 7a3a5a4a028b4adf, our team has conducted a deeper dive into the latency spike observed yesterday on the ICICI UPI AutoPay Mandate Integration.\n\nTo be frank, the intermittent nature of this issue is becoming a significant concern for us, as it directly impacts our merchant-facing SLAs. The core of the problem, as we've traced it, seems to be with the real-time risk scoring engine on ICICI's side during mandate creation.\n\nHere’s a summary of our findings for Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001:\n\n**1. Performance Metrics:**\n   - Our Grafana dashboards show a P99 latency spike for the `/mandate/create` endpoint, hitting peaks of up to 2.1s between 15:10 and 15:45 IST. This is well outside the 600ms SLA defined in our agreement (Doc#e883074798d547eb).\n   - During this period, the transaction volume was nominal, hovering around 40-50 TPS, which shouldn't stress the system.\n   - Error rates remained low at ~0.2%, but the user experience degradation from the latency is our primary worry.\n\n**2. Log Analysis:**\n   - We've analyzed the Kibana logs for the affected transaction IDs (a sample set was attached in file#9499d75846634fe7). Our internal service mesh shows that the delay occurs almost entirely after the API call is handed off to your gateway. The time from our request initiation to your acknowledgement is consistently under 50ms.\n   - The JWT token generation and OAuth 2.0 flow are functioning correctly with no added latency.\n\n**3. Compliance & Business Impact:**\n   - These delays risk pushing our overall mandate creation success rates below the thresholds expected under RBI guidelines. A poor user experience during this critical step leads to higher drop-offs, directly affecting our merchants' subscription funnels.\n   - This has been tracked internally under JIRA ticket PAY-5211.\n\nCould you please have your infrastructure and engineering teams specifically investigate the performance logs and resource utilization (CPU/memory) of the risk scoring microservice that serves our requests? It feels like either a cold start problem within your Kubernetes pods or a bottleneck in a downstream dependency that your risk engine calls.\n\nWe need to get to the bottom of this to ensure the stability of the integration. Could you please provide an RCA by EOD tomorrow?\n\nLet me know if you need any further data from our side.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiddharth Nair"],"timestamp":1757915460000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","engineering.leads@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["rahul.verma@icicibank.com","priya.sharma@icicibank.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","IMPORTANT"]}},

Building on the initial analysis from your email (e883074798d547eb), I've done a deeper dive into the settlement mismatch for the ICICI UPI AutoPay Mandate integration (Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001).\n\nThe issue is becoming a bit pressing. We're seeing a consistent shortfall in the T+1 settlement files from ICICI. As of this morning's batch file (ref file#9499d75846634fe7), we have identified 4,128 transactions from the last 24-hour cycle that were successfully processed on our end but are missing from their settlement report. This is tracked under JIRA PAY-5714.\n\nMy investigation so far:\n\n1.  **Log Analysis:** I've cross-referenced our transaction logs from the `upi-autopay-processor` service running on our Kubernetes cluster with the Bank RRNs. Kibana queries confirm that our system received a `TXN_SUCCESS` status from the NPCI gateway for all missing transactions. There are no anomalous error codes on our side.\n\n2.  **API Performance:** I've reviewed our Grafana dashboards for the ICICI bank integration. API health looks solid. The P99 latency for the `/mandate/execute` endpoint is stable at ~450ms, well within our SLA, and the error rate is nominal at 0.2%. This strongly suggests the issue is not with our real-time transaction processing pipeline.\n\n3.  **Hypothesis:** My current theory is that there's a disconnect in ICICI's downstream batch processing. The real-time mandate execution calls are succeeding, but these specific transactions are getting dropped before their settlement batch generation job runs. I suspect it might be a filtering or parsing error within their internal system that is silently failing. We haven't pushed any changes to the request payload structure, and it remains compliant with the specifications outlined in our previous discussions (reference email d7e5b68d3dd54ffc).\n\nThis reconciliation gap is a growing concern, not just from a financial float perspective, but also for our T+1 settlement adherence as per RBI guidelines. \n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **For ICICI (via our channels):** I have compiled a CSV with the `juspay_txn_id`, `bank_rrn`, and `timestamp` for all 4,128 missing transactions. We need to escalate this to our technical contacts at ICICI and request they investigate their EOD settlement file generation process for the UPI AutoPay product. Can you help get this in front of their engineering lead?\n*   **Internal:** I've updated JIRA PAY-5714 with the latest findings and attached the transaction list.\n\nI'm planning to schedule a call with the ICICI team for tomorrow afternoon to get a concrete update. We can't let this issue compound.

Building on your observations in email 92be5dfece164c4f, I've completed an investigation into the ICICI UPI AutoPay mandate creation failures.\n\nThe root cause is indeed API rate limiting from ICICI Bank's end. Our Grafana dashboards show a direct correlation between our peak transaction volume and a sharp increase in `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` responses from their `/mandate/v2/create` endpoint. During the 11 AM - 2 PM IST window, our error rate for this specific API call spikes from a baseline of 0.3% to nearly 5.0%, which is unacceptable for this service tier.\n\nOur target throughput for this integration is 150 TPS to meet merchant demand, but we are being throttled to approximately 45-50 TPS. I've analyzed the Kibana logs for our UPI gateway pods, and the pattern is consistent: a brief burst of successful requests followed by a hard rejection wall. This is significantly impacting our mandate creation funnel and user experience, with P99 latency for this step increasing from our target of 600ms to over 2.5s due to failed attempts.\n\nAs a temporary mitigation, I have deployed a more aggressive exponential backoff with jitter to our client-side retry logic. This has helped prevent a cascading failure in our system but is not a sustainable solution and further adds to the overall transaction latency. The OAuth 2.0 and JWT token exchange flows are working perfectly, so this is purely a server-side capacity configuration issue at ICICI.\n\nAccording to the technical specifications outlined in our signed SOW (referenced in file#9499d75846634fe7), we were allocated a minimum of 200 TPS. It appears this configuration was not correctly provisioned. I've updated JIRA PAY-8285 with all the relevant logs and dashboard snapshots.\n\nCould you please escalate this with our business counterparts at ICICI? This is now a critical path blocker for the ICICI UPI AutoPay Mandate Integration project (Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001) and poses a risk to our T+1 settlement timelines if not resolved promptly. We need them to review and adjust the rate limits for our registered client ID immediately.\n\nI'll continue to monitor the metrics and will schedule a follow-up call with their technical team for tomorrow to get a firm ETA.

Building on that, our team has conducted a deeper investigation into the KYC automation failures we are observing for high-risk customer segments as part of the ICICI UPI AutoPay Mandate Integration (Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001).\n\nOur Grafana dashboards indicate a sharp increase in failures, reaching a 12.5% error rate for this specific user cohort when calling your `/kyc/validate` endpoint. This is concerning as our overall KYC success rate for other segments remains healthy at 98.9%. The predominant issue we're tracking in JIRA PAY-7769 is the consistent return of the generic error code `E-403: KYC_VALIDATION_FAILED`.\n\nOur engineering lead, Aditya Singh, has cross-referenced our Kibana logs against the API specification outlined in file#9499d75846634fe7. We can confirm that the request payloads for these failed transactions are correctly structured and the OAuth 2.0 JWT token is valid. However, the p99 latency for these failed requests is alarmingly high, averaging 2.1s before timing out with the `E-403` error, a significant deviation from the ~450ms latency for successful validations. \n\nOur working hypothesis is that the backend validation process on your end may be encountering issues with specific data points common to this 'high-risk' segment, which we defined in our earlier conversation (ref: email#d7e5b68d3dd54ffc). The lack of granular error sub-codes beyond the generic `E-403` is a significant blocker, preventing our team from diagnosing the root cause or implementing effective client-side retries.\n\nGiven the direct impact on user onboarding and our strict adherence to RBI e-mandate guidelines, resolving this has become a top priority. This issue is rapidly consuming our error budget for the quarter.\n\nTo move forward, we have the following requests:\n\n1.  **ICICI Team:** Can you please investigate the server-side logs for a sample of failed `trace_ids` that we will share shortly? We urgently need a more detailed breakdown of why the validation is failing behind the `E-403` error.\n2.  **ICICI Team:** Would it be feasible to expose more granular error sub-codes in the API response in a future release? This would be invaluable for ongoing monitoring and debugging.\n3.  **Juspay (Aditya):** Please consolidate the log files containing the failed trace IDs from the last 48 hours and share them with Priya's team by EOD.\n\nI would also like to propose a joint technical call for tomorrow to debug this in real-time with our respective engineering teams. Please let me know what time would be suitable.\n\nThank you for your continued partnership on this.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRohit Sharma\nBusiness Development Manager | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757916120000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["priya.verma@icicibank.com"],"cc":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","sanjay.mehta@icicibank.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"]}},

The goal is to agree on the root cause and finalize our remediation plan.\n\nMy initial analysis points to the Fraud Detection Engine (FDE). The Grafana dashboard 'UPI-Mandate-Performance-v2' shows p99 latency for the `mandate.create` flow jumped to ~1.8s from a baseline of 450ms, starting around 14:30 IST. Kibana logs show a pattern of timeouts from the FDE service, and it looks correlated with the deployment of the feature flag `icici-autopay-risk-rules-v2`. I suspect one of the new rules is causing an inefficient query or lookup pattern in our Redis cache cluster.\n\nProposed path forward:\n-   **Immediate Mitigation:** I'll roll back the `icici-autopay-risk-rules-v2` flag in production to restore normal latency. I can do this during the call. (Owner: Arjun, ETA: Now)\n-   **Root Cause Analysis:** Riya, can you take the lead on a deep-dive of the new ruleset?

Since yesterday's deployment of our new fraud ruleset (v2.3), our false positive rate for mandate creation has jumped to an unacceptable 4.5%, way over our 0.5% threshold. This is actively blocking genuine customers and needs an immediate decision.\n\nFrom the quick analysis on the 'UPI_Mandate_Performance' Grafana dashboard, the spike seems correlated with the `user_transaction_frequency_zscore` feature being overly aggressive for users in Tier-3 cities. Riya, your initial log analysis on Kibana also pointed to this. We need to confirm if this is the sole cause or if there's something else we're missing with the data pipeline feeding the model.\n\nThe primary agenda is to decide between two paths: 1) A full, immediate rollback to ruleset v2.2 via our deployment pipeline, or 2) Attempting a targeted hotfix by tuning the feature weights. My proposal is to prepare for the rollback but give Riya's team a short window to attempt a fix. This meeting is to formalize that plan and get alignment.\n\nProposed next steps & AIs:\n- **Decision:** We will attempt a hotfix first. Riya to run a backtest disabling the problematic feature on the BigQuery dataset `prod_upi_autopay_logs_last_24h`. If the simulation isn't conclusive in 2 hours, I will trigger the rollback to v2.2. **Owner: Riya S. (Fix), Arjun M.

The audit identified the active use of a weak cipher suite, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, on the public-facing ingress for our 'upi-autopay-connector' service handling callbacks from ICICI Bank. This legacy cipher is vulnerable to POODLE and BEAST attacks and must be deprecated immediately. The current Nginx Ingress Controller configuration for this service endpoint lacks a specific ssl-ciphers annotation, causing it to fall back to a default profile that includes this outdated option. Disabling this cipher is critical to maintaining our PCI compliance posture and protecting sensitive mandate data in transit.","The proposed solution is to apply a strict cipher suite whitelist to the Ingress resource definition for the 'upi-autopay-connector'. We will modify the Kubernetes manifest to include the annotation 'nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-ciphers: \"TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256\"'. This change explicitly restricts TLS negotiations to these two modern, AEAD-based ciphers. We have already received confirmation from ICICI Bank's technical team (ref: their internal ticket ICICI-TECH-8921) that their outbound webhook servers fully support TLS 1.2+ with the specified cipher suites, mitigating the risk of integration failure. Monitoring will be configured in Prometheus to alert on any increase in the 'nginx_ingress_controller_ssl_handshake_errors_total' metric for this specific ingress post-deployment, which would indicate a negotiation failure.","Immediate action items are as follows: First, the updated Ingress manifest will be deployed to the 'k8s-staging-cluster-1' environment by EOD today. Second, a Qualys SSL Labs scan will be initiated against the staging endpoint to validate the removal of the weak cipher and confirm an 'A+' grade is achieved. Third, upon successful validation, a change request will be raised for a production rollout during the next scheduled maintenance window (Tuesday, 2 AM IST). Post-deployment, I will upload the before/after Qualys reports to our Vanta instance as conclusive evidence of remediation for the audit finding.

These events correlate directly with transaction volumes exceeding approximately 200 TPS, a figure substantially lower than the projected 894 TPS outlined in the initial SOW. Our internal monitoring maps these failures to the error code `JUS_GW_ICICI_RATE_LIMIT`, and we've observed the mandate processing Kafka queue (`mandate-create-jobs-v2`) backing up, leading to P99 latency exceeding 1500ms against a target of 351ms.","This undocumented rate limit poses a direct threat to merchant SLAs, particularly for subscription-based platforms relying on timely mandate registration.

Regarding your point about checking our request payload, our engineering team has re-verified the implementation against the API specification, and everything appears correct on our end. Unfortunately, the issue with payment routing for our cross-border merchants persists.\n\nWe are still seeing a significant number of mandate creation failures originating from merchants with specific Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) tied to international entities. The overall success rate has dipped by nearly 4.5% for this segment since yesterday, which is quite concerning. Our Grafana dashboard (Payments-Latency-Dashboard-ICICI) shows a spike in failures with the error code `U16` (Risk threshold exceeded), which seems to be coming directly from the NPCI network, likely triggered by a configuration on the ICICI gateway side.\n\nAs you know, this ICICI UPI AutoPay Mandate Integration (Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001) is critical for several of our key merchants. The initial analysis we shared in `file 636c968a19824ce1` highlighted a few sample transaction IDs that failed. We've compiled more logs in Kibana, and the pattern is consistent: domestic-to-domestic transactions are processing fine with an average latency of ~250ms, but this specific cross-border segment is failing at a rate of almost 80%.\n\nI've consolidated all technical findings and logs under our internal ticket, JIRA PAY-1257, for streamlined tracking. Could your team please perform a deeper check on the backend routing and risk assessment rules for these international MCCs? It feels like there might be an incorrect policy applied that is blocking these legitimate mandate requests, which are fully compliant with current RBI guidelines for recurring payments.\n\nWe need to get this resolved urgently to restore service for our merchants and meet our uptime SLAs.

This is obviously a high-priority issue for us, and the team immediately began an investigation for the ICICI UPI AutoPay Mandate Integration (Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001).\n\nWe've tracked this under JIRA PAY-1158. Our initial analysis confirms the audit finding: sensitive VPA data was being logged in plain text within our Kibana cluster for a subset of failed mandate creation requests. This appears to be a direct violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 concerning the masking of sensitive authentication data.\n\nHere’s a summary of our findings:\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The issue stemmed from an unhandled exception block in our `upi-autopay-connector` microservice. Specifically, when receiving certain error codes from the ICICI `/mandate/create` endpoint (e.g., U16 - Invalid VPA), our error handling logic was logging the entire request payload for debugging purposes. This was an oversight in a legacy error module.\n*   **Impact Analysis:** Based on our Grafana dashboards, this has affected approximately 0.21% of mandate creation API calls over the last 30 days, with an average latency spike to 1.8s on these failed transactions. While the transaction volume is low, the compliance exposure is unacceptable. We’ve cross-referenced the trace IDs you provided in `file#636c968a19824ce1` and can confirm the logs originated from our `upi-autopay-connector` Kubernetes pods in the production environment.\n*   **Immediate Remediation:** We have already developed and deployed a hotfix to our staging environment. This fix explicitly redacts the `payerVpa` and `payeeDetails` fields from the request object before it's passed to our logging framework. We are aiming for a production rollout by EOD today, pending final QA sign-off. Our uptime SLA of 99.95% will not be affected by this deployment.\n\nBuilding on the analysis from email 0bc938c2fb9743a3, we have a question for your technical team. The verbose error response from your API, which echoes the full request payload, contributed to this logging risk. Would it be possible for ICICI Bank to return a more concise error object containing only the transaction ID, error code, and a description? This would be more aligned with RBI data minimization guidelines and would help us build a more resilient and secure integration on our end.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Juspay:** Deploy hotfix for JIRA PAY-1158 to production. **Owner:** Juspay Eng Team. **ETA:** Today, Dec 7th.\n2.  **Juspay:** Initiate a script to purge the affected historical logs from our Kibana cluster. A completion report will be shared. **Owner:** Juspay Infra Team. **ETA:** Dec 9th.\n3.  **ICICI Bank:** Please review the feasibility of providing a simplified error response for failed mandate creations. **Owner:** ICICI Tech Team.\n\nLet's schedule a brief call early next week to confirm the resolution and discuss the API response optimization.

Building on your analysis in email 0d7f037f693342a8, I've done a deeper dive into the elevated KYC automation failures for the ICICI UPI AutoPay Mandate Integration (Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001), and the situation is a bit more nuanced than a simple failure.\n\nOur investigation, tracked under JIRA PAY-3025, points to a specific issue with how ICICI Bank's API is handling mandate creation requests for customer segments our internal fraud detection system flags as 'high-risk'. \n\nHere’s what we're seeing:\n\n1.  **Error Pattern:** For standard-risk users, the mandate creation API call completes successfully with an average P99 latency of around 450ms. However, for users flagged by our system, we're seeing a spike in timeouts. Our Grafana dashboard shows these requests are hitting a latency of over 2.5s before our system terminates them, but Kibana logs reveal ICICI's gateway is eventually responding with a generic `U99 - Transaction Timed Out at Bank` error code.\n\n2.  **Root Cause Hypothesis:** Instead of returning a deterministic failure code (e.g., 'KYC_FAILED', 'RISK_THRESHOLD_BREACHED'), ICICI's internal risk assessment engine appears to be holding the request for an extended period before timing out. This non-specific `U99` response is problematic because our UPI gateway is built to interpret it as a transient network issue and schedules the mandate for retry. This is creating a retry loop, artificially inflating our transaction processing volume and delaying a definitive failure status for the user.\n\n3.  **Business & Compliance Impact:** This ambiguity is preventing us from triggering the correct downstream exception handling process. It's causing a significant backlog for manual review, impacting user experience, and more critically, it compromises our audit trail for regulatory reporting. We need a clear, final status for each attempt to stay compliant with RBI guidelines.\n\nThis behavior deviates from the expected error handling specified in their API documentation (ref: file#636c968a19824ce1) which we had clarified earlier (ref: email#0bc938c2fb9743a3).\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Siddharth (Me):** I will reach out to our technical counterparts at ICICI Bank immediately to escalate this. I'll need them to investigate why their risk engine is causing a timeout instead of returning a specific business-decline error code. I'll push for a hotfix on their end to ensure responses are deterministic and within our 800ms SLA.\n*   **Aditya (You):** As a containment strategy, can we explore a short-term patch? Let's evaluate the feasibility of modifying our ICICI integration service to treat a `U99` response on the `/mandate-creation` endpoint as a hard failure if the request has been active for >1.5s. This is not ideal, but it would stop the retry loop.\n\nI am a bit concerned about getting a quick resolution from the ICICI team given their current release freeze. We need to press this, as it's affecting our core mandate success metrics. I've scheduled a placeholder meeting for tomorrow EOD to sync on their findings.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on the interim patch.\n\nRegards,\n\nSiddharth Nair"],"timestamp":1757912280000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","payments-dev@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

P99 latency shot up from our usual ~250ms to over 2.5s, and the error rate for this specific flow is hovering around 4.5%, up from a baseline of <0.2%. This is a direct violation of our 99.95% uptime SLA for this integration.\n\nDiving into the Kibana logs for our UPI gateway pods, I can confirm the root cause is an OAuth token refresh failure.

I've attached a snippet of the relevant logs to JIRA PAY-1342.\n\nOur OAuth client implementation and JWT generation logic have not been touched in the last two sprints and are compliant with the specs laid out in file#636c968a19824ce1. This same logic is working flawlessly with our other banking partners, which strongly suggests the issue is localized to the ICICI auth infrastructure. I'm a bit concerned this might be related to an uncommunicated change or a new rate-limiter on their end, as we discussed in our sync last month (ref: email#0bc938c2fb9743a3).\n\nAs a temporary mitigation, I've configured a more aggressive, short-term retry mechanism on the refresh token call, but it's putting extra load on our system and isn't a viable long-term fix. We are already logging these failures for audit purposes, but if this continues, it will become a reportable incident under RBI guidelines.\n\n**Action Items:**\n*   **ICICI Team (cc'd):** Can you please urgently investigate your OAuth 2.0 server logs for requests originating from our gateway IPs? We need to understand why the refresh token grant is failing. Please treat this as high priority.\n*   **My action:** I will continue to monitor the transaction failure rate and have set up a specific alert in our monitoring system. I'm tracking this under Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001.\n*   **Aditya:** I have updated JIRA PAY-1342 with all these technical details.\n\nWe need a resolution from ICICI's side as soon as possible to restore service stability.

Building on your last email (26ca99082df0411f), our engineering team has completed their investigation into the high failure rates during our UAT load testing for the ICICI UPI AutoPay Mandate integration.\n\nWe have definitively traced the issue to API rate limiting on the ICICI gateway. Our Grafana dashboards confirm that while we are pushing a load of 500 TPS, our actual successful mandate creation rate is being throttled to a hard ceiling of ~150 TPS. This is causing a significant number of transactions to fail with `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors, which we've correlated in our Kibana logs originating from the `/mandates/v2/create` endpoint.\n\nTo be frank, this is a critical blocker for Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001. We are unable to complete our performance and reliability validation, which is a key prerequisite for merchant go-live. The current limit is well below the 500 TPS baseline we aligned on in the technical specification document (ref: file#636c968a19824ce1). The resulting failure rate (over 60% during peak tests) is preventing us from accurately measuring P99 latency and ensuring the stability of our OAuth 2.0 JWT token management under sustained load.\n\nOur internal tracking ticket for this is JIRA PAY-6645. We need this resolved urgently to keep the project timeline on track and ensure we meet the RBI's compliance standards for mandate processing reliability before launch.\n\nCould you please escalate this to your infrastructure team to have the rate limits for our registered client ID increased to the agreed-upon 500 TPS, with a burst capacity of at least 700 TPS? We have a testing window scheduled for tomorrow and would like to re-run our full suite of tests then.\n\nPlease provide an ETA for this configuration change.

Our monitoring systems are flagging a significant number of `HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)` responses during our peak processing windows (11 AM - 2 PM IST). It's getting a bit stressful on our end as merchant-facing errors are climbing.\n\nHere's a summary of the impact we're observing:\n\n*   **Observed TPS Limit:** Our traffic is being throttled at approximately 150 TPS. You can see this clearly on our Grafana dashboard.\n*   **Required Throughput:** Our projections, based on merchant traffic patterns, require a minimum sustained throughput of 450 TPS to ensure a smooth customer experience and prevent backlog.\n*   **Error Rate:** This throttling is causing a direct spike in our transaction failure rate, which is now hovering at 3.5% for this specific flow. This is well above our acceptable SLA threshold of 0.5%.\n*   **Latency:** Our p99 latency for this API call is spiking to over 2.2s before the 429 errors begin, up from a baseline of 450ms. I've attached a dashboard snapshot in file#636c968a19824ce1 that visualizes this degradation.\n\nOur engineering team has thoroughly reviewed our implementation. Our Kubernetes pod scaling is functioning as expected, and our OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow and JWT token management are well within the specifications. Kibana logs (query attached) confirm the issue is isolated to the 429 responses from your gateway; this is not on our side.\n\nThis level of transaction failure is unsustainable and is directly impacting our merchants' ability to onboard users for recurring payments, a time-sensitive process under RBI guidelines. We are tracking this internally under JIRA ticket PAY-4530.\n\n**Action Required:**\nWe urgently request an immediate increase of the rate limit for our client ID to at least 500 TPS for the `/mandates/v2/create` endpoint. This will provide the necessary headroom and restore service stability.\n\nCould you please confirm by EOD today if this temporary increase can be actioned? Following that, we need to schedule a brief call to discuss a more permanent capacity plan to support our projected growth. This feels like a short-term fix, and we need a more robust long-term solution.\n\nLet me know what you need from our side to expedite this.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nSiddharth Nair\nVendor Success Manager | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757912880000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@icicibank.com","api.support@icicibank.com"],"cc":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","payments-engineering@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Our monitoring systems are showing a persistent issue with API timeouts when our systems attempt to refresh the OAuth 2.0 access token via your `/oauth/token` endpoint. Here’s a summary of the impact we're seeing in our staging environment over the last 12 hours:\n\n*   **Metric:** API Call Error Rate (Mandate Creation)\n    *   **Value:** Peaking at ~4.8%.\n    *   **Impact:** This directly translates to mandate creation failures for merchants, which is unacceptable for a production environment.\n*   **Metric:** P99 Latency for `/oauth/token` Endpoint\n    *   **Value:** Consistently spiking above 2.5 seconds, with frequent timeouts.\n    *   **Expected:** Our SLA requires a P99 latency under 400ms for this authentication step.\n\nOur engineering team, led by Priya, has done a thorough investigation on our side. We've traced the issue in our Kibana logs and can confirm that our JWT generation and request signing process are correctly implemented as per the specifications laid out in `file#636c968a19824ce1`. The failures are not correlated with any specific deployment or configuration change on our Kubernetes clusters.\n\nFrom our perspective, this points to a potential performance bottleneck or an overly aggressive rate-limiter on the ICICI UAT environment's authentication service. The intermittent nature of the timeouts reinforces this hypothesis. I've updated the primary ticket, JIRA PAY-5130, with detailed trace logs and the corresponding Grafana dashboard snapshots showing the error correlation.\n\n**Action Item for ICICI Bank Team:**\nCould you please have your technical team immediately investigate the server-side logs for the `/oauth/token` endpoint? We need to understand if you are seeing corresponding errors, resource exhaustion (CPU/memory), or if your internal firewalls/rate-limiters are throttling our requests. Any insight you can provide would be immensely helpful.\n\nWe're now at a point where this issue is jeopardizing our agreed-upon go-live schedule. We must ensure the platform's stability to meet RBI's e-mandate guidelines and provide a reliable service.

Our Grafana dashboards show a severe degradation in their API performance. Specifically, the p99 latency for the `/mandate/create` endpoint has jumped from a stable baseline of ~450ms to sustained peaks of over 2.5 seconds. This is causing widespread timeouts across our integration layer.\n\nHere’s a summary of the impact:\n\n*   **Error Rate Spike:** Our timeout error rate has surged to 3.8%, which is well above the 0.5% SLA threshold we have for this integration. I've documented this with dashboard snapshots in JIRA PAY-3399.\n*   **TPS Throttling:** The high latency is forcing our systems to throttle new requests. We are struggling to maintain 120 TPS, a significant drop from the target of 195 TPS required for peak load.\n*   **Internal vs. External Latency:** Kibana logs confirm the issue is external. Our internal processing time within the UPI gateway, including JWT generation and request signing, remains constant at approximately 85ms. The rest of the duration is spent waiting for a response from ICICI's API gateway.\n\nAs a short-term mitigation, I've tightened the circuit-breaker configurations on our Kubernetes egress services connecting to ICICI. This will at least prevent cascading failures and resource exhaustion on our end, but it's a reactive measure that still results in failed mandate creations for the end-user.\n\nThis performance level is a major deviation from the agreed-upon metrics in our SOW (referenced in our initial planning Doc#42faa5e774aa4d90 and the attached performance benchmarks file#636c968a19824ce1) and jeopardizes the project timeline. We cannot proceed to the next phase of UAT under these conditions, as it also puts us at risk of breaching RBI's mandate processing TAT guidelines.\n\nWe need to formally escalate this with our technical counterparts at ICICI Bank and request an immediate RCA and a concrete timeline for when their system performance will be restored to the contracted levels.

Our Grafana dashboards show a direct correlation between failed calls to your OAuth token refresh endpoint and subsequent timeouts on key business APIs like `/mandate-initiate`. P99 latency is spiking to over 2.5s, leading to a 4.2% error rate in our load tests, which is well above the 0.5% tolerance for production readiness. Kibana logs consistently show `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` on our side when our services attempt to get a new access token.\n\nOur engineering team has traced this to the OAuth 2.0 refresh token flow. The initial JWT exchange works as expected, but subsequent attempts to use the refresh token are failing intermittently. Our token management service, running on our Kubernetes infrastructure, is configured to request a new token 10 minutes prior to expiry, as agreed upon and documented in file#636c968a19824ce1. However, it appears the token is being invalidated prematurely by your system, causing our requests to fail. This is all tracked under JIRA PAY-8526.\n\nThis level of instability is a major blocker for our UAT phase and poses a significant risk to meeting the RBI compliance requirements for payment processing reliability.\n\nTo move forward, we have two urgent requests for your team:\n\n1.  **Investigate Server-Side Logs:** Could you please have your infrastructure team examine the logs for the `/oauth/token` endpoint from yesterday between 15:00 and 17:00 IST? We need to understand the exact rejection reason or error code being generated when our refresh token requests are denied.\n2.  **Confirm Token Lifecycle:** Can you provide a definitive confirmation on the refresh token's validity period and any specific invalidation rules (e.g., single-use, IP-binding, inactivity timeout)? A precise understanding will allow us to align our token management strategy and prevent these failures.\n\nWe have a call scheduled for tomorrow at 11 AM IST to discuss this.

I've been digging through our Kibana logs for the UPI gateway service and found that specific, unmasked PII elements from the `payer` object in the ICICI API response are being logged in plain text. This is happening during the callback processing for the `/mandate/create/v2` endpoint. While our core performance metrics on the Grafana dashboard remain stable (P99 latency is holding steady at ~420ms and no unusual error spikes), this is a critical violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 and needs immediate remediation.\n\nThe root cause appears to be an overly permissive logging configuration on our side that is capturing the entire raw response object from ICICI before our internal data mappers sanitize it. This is a bit frustrating as it bypasses the masking protocols we defined in our spec document during the initial design phase. I've updated JIRA ticket PAY-8007 with these specifics, including log snippets and references to the auditor's report (file#636c968a19824ce1).\n\nHere's the immediate action plan:\n\n1.  **Hotfix (Owner: Dev Team, ETA: EOD Today):** An emergency patch to our logging middleware in the Kubernetes deployment for the UPI gateway service. We need to explicitly filter out the `payer` object from the ICICI callback response before it hits the logger. This should be a straightforward change. Can the on-call engineer pick this up?\n\n2.  **Verification (Owner: Myself, ETA: Tonight):** Once the hotfix is deployed to staging and then production, I will personally verify through Kibana that the sensitive data is no longer being logged.\n\n3.  **Vendor Engagement (Owner: Myself, ETA: Tomorrow AM):** I will reach out to our technical contacts at ICICI Bank to discuss a long-term solution. Ideally, their API should not be returning this data in the first place, or it should be in a separate, secured field.

There were no timeouts or abnormal responses logged from our side, indicating the issue likely occurred post-transaction confirmation within the settlement batching process.\n\nFor instance, `juspay_txn_id: JPAY240912UPM138751`, an AutoPay execution for ₹500, was successfully processed at 15:05:12 IST. We have the full transaction lifecycle log, including the JWT token exchange and the final success callback.

After reviewing the Kibana logs for our `upi-mandate-service`, I can confirm a failure rate of approximately 4.5% for accounts flagged by our internal risk engine. This is a significant deviation from our baseline <0.3% error rate for standard mandate creation requests.\n\nKey observations from my analysis:\n\n1.  **API Error Response:** ICICI's gateway is consistently returning the error code `U28 - Customer KYC validation failed`. This occurs after our system successfully establishes a session via the OAuth 2.0 flow and passes the JWT for authentication.\n\n2.  **Latency Spikes:** The Grafana dashboard monitoring our `icici-autopay-api` endpoint shows that the P99 latency for these failed requests to `/mandate/v2/initiate` is spiking to ~2.2 seconds, compared to the average 450ms for successful transactions. This suggests their system is performing additional, time-intensive checks before rejecting the request.\n\n3.  **Payload Hypothesis:** Based on the API specifications in file#636c968a19824ce1 and our prior technical discussion (ref email#0bc938c2fb9743a3), my primary hypothesis is that ICICI's backend applies a more stringent, non-standard validation logic for customers their risk engine deems high-risk. Our current request payload, while compliant with the standard spec, may be missing a specific field or using an unexpected format that this secondary validation layer requires. This behavior is unfortunately not documented in the integration guide provided.\n\nI have already raised this with the ICICI technical support team, providing them with request/response samples for a dozen failed transaction IDs and have explicitly requested clarification on their validation logic for such cases.

We've been tracking this internally under JIRA PAY-1749. Since the last CI/CD deployment on Tuesday, our Grafana dashboards show a significant spike in mandate execution failures for non-INR transactions. The error rate for this segment has jumped from an acceptable 0.2% to an alarming 4.8%.\n\nDrilling down into the Kibana logs, we're consistently seeing transactions initiated from international accounts being rejected with NPCI error code `U69 - Transaction not permitted to VPA`. This suggests that these transactions are being incorrectly routed through the domestic UPI rails instead of the designated cross-border processing channel. The latency for these failed requests is also degrading, averaging around 2200ms before timing out, which is well above our 400ms P99 SLA for mandate executions.\n\nThis is a bit concerning as it directly impacts our ability to serve international merchants and creates a potential compliance issue with RBI's cross-border payment guidelines. The expected behavior, as documented in the SOW (file#636c968a19824ce1), was that your gateway would route transactions based on the currency and country code present in the `mandate.execute` API call. Right now, it appears a default domestic routing rule might be overriding this logic for our merchant ID.\n\nCould your technical team please verify the routing and MCC (Merchant Category Code) configurations for our integration on the ICICI gateway? A similar issue was briefly mentioned during our initial discussions (reference email#0bc938c2fb9743a3), and we want to ensure all parameters are correctly set up.\n\nTo expedite resolution, I have two action items:\n\n1.  **Juspay:** Our engineering lead, Priya, will provide you with a sample of 5-10 failed transaction IDs and corresponding trace logs from our end by 3:00 PM IST today.\n2.  **ICICI Bank:** Could you please have your team review the routing rules against these transaction IDs and confirm if they are being processed as domestic or international? A confirmation by EOD would be extremely helpful.\n\nLet me know if a quick joint call with our engineering teams would be more efficient. We need to get this resolved urgently to restore the service for our international customers and maintain our uptime commitments.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nRohit"],"timestamp":1757914320000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.s@juspay.in","ankit.verma@icicibank.com"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["ankit.verma@icicibank.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on your analysis from email 7be2f940956f40e4, I've dug into the issue, and I'm a bit concerned about what I found regarding the ICICI UPI AutoPay mandate integration.\n\nThe recent PCI DSS audit has flagged a critical compliance violation in our logging for this flow (Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001), which has now been escalated under JIRA PAY-2417. Our `upi-autopay-service` is currently logging the entire raw response object from ICICI's `/v2/mandates/create` endpoint at the INFO level. A review of our Kibana logs confirms this is exposing customer UPI VPAs and other PII in plain text, which is a direct and serious breach of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4.\n\nThis is a P0 issue, and we need to remediate it immediately. The audit team has given us an extremely tight deadline.\n\nHere’s the plan I've formulated with the Payments Dev team:\n\n1.  **Immediate Hotfix:** Rakesh's team is already working on a patch. The plan is to modify the logging interceptor in our Kubernetes deployment to redact the entire response payload, logging only the `mandate_id`, HTTP status, and error codes. This should prevent any further data leakage. We need to watch our Grafana dashboards post-deployment to ensure this change doesn't impact our P99 latency, which is currently holding steady at around 850ms for this endpoint.\n\n2.  **Historical Data Purge:** This is the more complicated part. The security team needs to initiate a purge of this sensitive data from our logging archives. Priya, could you please assess the scope and provide an ETA for a script that can scrub the records going back at least 90 days? We need to present a concrete plan to the auditors.\n\n3.  **Vendor Follow-up:** I will personally reach out to our technical counterparts at ICICI Bank. While I suspect the responsibility for logging lies with us, I want to confirm if their API provides any mechanism to control response field verbosity, building on our earlier discussion referenced in email 0bc938c2fb9743a3. This is more for due diligence as we close this loop.\n\nLet’s treat this with the urgency it requires. The hotfix should be in staging by EOD.

Building on the analysis from your email a553c94838ff4bc2, I've spent the morning investigating the latency spike in the ICICI UPI AutoPay risk scoring engine.\n\nThe situation is a bit concerning. I've reviewed our Grafana dashboards and correlated the timestamps with Kibana logs for our K8s payment gateway pods. During peak hours yesterday (approx. 16:00 - 16:45 IST), our P99 latency for the `/mandates/create` API endpoint jumped from a stable ~400ms to an unacceptable 2.3s. This directly contributed to a 3.5% increase in mandate creation timeouts, which is far outside our acceptable error budget for this integration (Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001).\n\nOur internal service calls, including the OAuth 2.0 token generation and the initial hand-off to the NPCI gateway, are all performing within their ~150ms SLA. The logs clearly show the delay is occurring after we make the synchronous call to ICICI's risk scoring service. The issue seems to be on their end, possibly a resource contention issue within their infrastructure, as it doesn't correlate with our transaction throughput, which held steady around 12k TPS.\n\nI have consolidated these findings and attached the relevant log exports (referenced in file#636c968a19824ce1) to JIRA PAY-6786. These intermittent failures could become a compliance headache for us regarding audit trails required by RBI guidelines if they persist.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **My Action:** I am drafting a formal escalation email to our technical counterparts at ICICI Bank, providing the specific timestamps and transaction IDs, and requesting an urgent root cause analysis (RCA). I will reference our prior communication on this (email#0bc938c2fb9743a3).\n2.  **Ask for SRE:** Could you please ensure the alert thresholds on our monitoring systems for this specific endpoint remain heightened?

Building on your analysis in email a02b801791d841a8, I've done a deeper infrastructure-level investigation into the performance degradation on the ICICI UPI AutoPay Mandate Integration (Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001).\n\nThe situation has become critical. The bottleneck is almost certainly originating from ICICI's backend, likely related to the core banking system migration they notified us about in email 0bc938c2fb9743a3. Our systems are showing significant strain waiting for their API responses.\n\nHere are the specific metrics from our end:\n\n1.  **Latency Spike:** Our primary Grafana dashboard for this integration shows P99 latency for the `/mandate/create` endpoint has skyrocketed from a healthy baseline of ~350ms to over 2.2 seconds. We're even seeing frequent timeouts exceeding 5 seconds.\n\n2.  **Error Rate Increase:** The transaction error rate, which we are required by our internal SLOs to keep under 0.2%, has surged to 4.5% over the last 12 hours. The predominant error is an HTTP `504 Gateway Timeout` originating from ICICI's end.\n\n3.  **Infrastructure Health:** I've confirmed our Kubernetes cluster health. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for our UPI gateway services is functioning as expected, scaling from 20 to 50 pods to handle the connection backlog. However, CPU and memory utilization on our pods remain nominal. Log analysis in Kibana shows our internal processing time, including the OAuth 2.0 JWT validation, is stable at ~45ms. The delta is entirely external wait time.\n\nThe high failure rate is not just a performance issue; it's a compliance risk. These timeouts could put us in breach of RBI's stipulated TAT for transaction processing and negatively impact our SOC 2 audit trail. I have created JIRA PAY-5618 to formally track this incident and its resolution.\n\nCould the ICICI team please investigate whether their new core banking system has under-provisioned resources or if there are new, undocumented rate limits in place? Providing us with server-side logs from their API gateway for the transaction IDs we forwarded earlier would be immensely helpful to isolate the root cause.\n\n**Action Items:**\n*   **ICICI Team:** Please acknowledge this issue and provide an EOD update on your investigation timeline. We need to know if a hotfix is possible or if we should prepare to route traffic away.\n*   **Priya:** Can you begin quantifying the business impact (e.g., number of failed mandates, merchant escalations) to share with leadership?\n*   **Arjun (Me):** I will continue to monitor our infrastructure and have set up alerts to trigger if the error rate exceeds 5.5%.

I've been reviewing the Grafana dashboards, and this latency spike in our real-time risk scoring engine for the ICICI UPI AutoPay mandate flow is quite concerning.\n\nSeeing the P99 latency for the mandate creation API jump from our usual baseline of ~200ms to consistent spikes between 800ms and 1.5s is a major red flag. This isn't just a backend metric; it's directly impacting our transaction success rate. The Kibana logs show a corresponding increase in `MANDATE_CREATION_TIMEOUT` errors, pushing our error rate for this specific integration from a stable 0.4% up to 2.1% during peak load periods yesterday. This is unacceptable for a critical partner integration like this, and it puts our T+1 settlement cycle at risk if failures persist.\n\nAs you noted, the issue seems to be localized within our internal risk assessment service before the call is made to ICICI's gateway. The correlation with our recent Kubernetes deployment for the fraud detection module feels too strong to be a coincidence. Is it possible the new rule set is causing database contention or a bottleneck in the JWT token verification step? The investigation documented in JIRA PAY-9656 needs to prioritize this hypothesis.\n\nWhile the team digs deeper on our end, I think we need to prepare for the possibility that the issue lies at the intersection of our systems. A latent response from ICICI's OAuth 2.0 service, for instance, could cascade into these kinds of timeouts under load.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Your Team):** Please continue the RCA as per JIRA PAY-9656. It would be great to get a conclusive finding on whether the new fraud rules are the root cause by EOD tomorrow. If so, what are our options for a hotfix or rollback?\n2.  **Business Development (Me):** I will connect with our counterparts at ICICI Bank to give them a heads-up. I'll frame it as a joint performance review and try to get their core engineering team on a call with us by early next week to review the end-to-end flow. I'll reference the integration specs from Doc#589484e70677446e to ensure we're all on the same page.\n\nLet’s stay on top of this.

I've spent the morning digging into the spike in mandate failures for the ICICI UPI AutoPay integration, and I'm quite concerned with the findings.\n\nThe issue, as you suspected, stems from our internal fraud detection model generating an excessive number of false positives specifically for this flow (Work ID a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001). This is directly impacting our mandate creation success rate.\n\nHere’s a summary of the impact based on our Grafana dashboard (ref: grafana.juspay.in/d/def456/payments-errors):\n\n*   **False Positive Rate:** We've observed a sharp increase from our baseline of ~0.5% to a sustained 4.2% over the last 24 hours. This is an order of magnitude higher than our acceptable threshold for UPI mandates and is triggering alerts.\n*   **Mandate Success Rate:** Consequently, the overall success rate for ICICI AutoPay mandate creation via our `/v2/mandates/create` endpoint has dropped from a healthy 98.5% to 94.3%.\n*   **API Impact:** Our system is correctly returning a `MANDATE_REJECTED_RISK` error, but the root cause is the faulty risk score. This has already led to a ~15% increase in support tickets from merchants using this integration.\n\nI’ve looped in Aditya from the Data Science team. He's analyzing the model's feature weights, suspecting that a recent model update might be misinterpreting certain transaction patterns common in recurring payments. The entire investigation is being tracked under JIRA PAY-4833. I've attached a subset of Kibana logs from the past 12 hours to the ticket, highlighting legitimate-looking transactions that were blocked. The pattern appears to disproportionately affect new users attempting their first mandate with high-value subscription merchants.\n\nWhile Aditya’s team works on a permanent fix by retraining the model, the current failure rate is unsustainable and frankly, a bit stressful. We can't afford this level of customer friction. I'd like to propose a short-term mitigation: can we consider temporarily lowering the model's sensitivity threshold for this specific flow from 0.9 to 0.75? The alternative of whitelisting certain merchant categories feels riskier and might not hold up under our next RBI audit for consistent rule application.\n\nLet's schedule a quick 15-minute call today to decide on an immediate course of action.

Our Grafana dashboards confirm we are being throttled at approximately 45-50 TPS. Beyond this threshold, we see a sharp increase in mandate creation failures.\n\n2.  **API Error Response:** Our Kibana logs are consistently showing `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors from your `/upi/v2/mandate/create` endpoint. The P99 latency for failed requests jumps from an average of 250ms to over 2.5s before timing out, which is causing a significant degradation in user experience.\n\n3.  **Impact on Error Rate:** This throttling has pushed our mandate creation error rate to over 4.2%, well above the 0.5% SLA we maintain. This is not sustainable and poses a risk to meeting our compliance obligations under RBI guidelines for payment system stability.\n\nFrom our end, I can confirm that our infrastructure is not the bottleneck.

After we enabled the new ICICI UPI AutoPay rules, p99 latency for mandate creation requests jumped from our ~150ms baseline to over 2.1s. This breached our SLOs and led to a ~4% transaction timeout rate for that flow, which is unacceptable. Thanks to the quick rollback via the feature flag `icici-autopay-advanced-risk`, we mitigated the immediate impact.\n\nMy initial analysis points towards a compute bottleneck. The Grafana dashboard (`Payments-Latency-Primary-v3`) shows a direct correlation between the deployment (`dep-77a8c1f`) and the latency jump. CPU utilization on the Kubernetes pods for the risk engine hit 100%, while memory usage remained stable. Priya, my hypothesis is that one of the new rules, maybe the one that cross-references past mandate behavior from our BigQuery `transaction_history` dataset, is causing an inefficient query pattern. The Kibana logs confirm the engine was processing requests correctly, just extremely slowly, which points away from a logic bug and towards a performance issue.\n\nHere's the proposed plan to move forward. The primary decision is to keep the `icici-autopay-advanced-risk` flag OFF in production until we have a validated fix. Action items are as follows:\n- **AI (Priya):** Profile the new ICICI-specific ruleset in the staging environment to isolate the inefficient code path or query. Please attach a flame graph and your findings to PAY-2272. ETA: EOD Thursday.\n- **AI (Arjun):** I will model the cost/performance impact of vertically scaling the `fraud-detection-v2` node pool as a potential short-term mitigation. This will be our fallback if a code fix takes more than a few days. ETA: Friday.\n- **AI (Anjali):** Please create a new performance test suite that specifically simulates the ICICI mandate creation load profile. We need this integrated into our pre-prod pipeline to prevent similar regressions. Let's aim to have this ready by next week's release cycle.\n\nWe need to get this resolved to fully launch the ICICI integration. Let's use this meeting to confirm these AIs and discuss any other potential root causes I might have missed. I've already updated the Confluence page with the initial incident timeline, and I'll add the decisions and AIs from this meeting to create the final post-mortem document.\n\nkeywords: post-mortem, PAY-2272, latency, risk engine, UPI AutoPay, ICICI, performance, remediation, devops","status":"confirmed","createdAt":1757919256541,"updatedAt":1757919256541,"app":"google-calendar","entity":"event","creator":{"displayName":"Arjun Mehta","email":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in"},"startTime":1757920320000,"endTime":1757923920000,"joiningLink":"https://meet.google.com/xyz-pdq-abc","permissions":["aditya.singh@juspay.in","priya.sharma@juspay.in","ravi.kumar@juspay.in","anjali.desai@juspay.in"]}},

The error rate for these specific mandate creations is hovering around 8%, which is way above our 0.5% SLO. I've been digging through the Kibana logs for the `payment-gateway` service, and it looks like we're getting a cluster of `503 Service Unavailable` errors when it tries to communicate with the `kyc-verification-service`. This only seems to happen for users flagged by our Fraud Detection Engine as 'high-risk'.\n\nMy initial hypothesis is that it might be a resource contention issue. The `kyc-verification-service` pod's CPU usage spikes to 95% during these attempts, according to the Grafana dashboard I've linked. It's possible the enhanced validation logic for high-risk users is more computationally expensive than we anticipated, and the Kubernetes resource limits are too low. Another possibility is a downstream timeout from the new document OCR validation API we integrated last month. I've attached the Confluence doc with the architecture for reference.\n\nAgenda:\n1.  Quick review of Grafana metrics & Kibana logs (I'll share my screen). (5 mins)\n2.  Saanvi: Can you walk us through the code path for the 'high-risk' segment within the `kyc-verification-service`?

Rohan's patch for the Euler ledger service looks solid in staging, but we need a clear, phased rollout plan to avoid any impact on live INR settlements. The main goal here is to de-risk the deployment for currencies like USD and AED, which have been failing reconciliation against ICICI's settlement files.\n\nHere’s the proposed agenda for our discussion:\n1.  **Canary Deployment Strategy:** I'm thinking we use a feature flag, `enable-multicurrency-settlement-fix-v2`, and initially enable it for a small, non-critical merchant cohort (maybe 1% of volume). We need to agree on the exact cohort and the duration of the canary phase. Can we validate this approach?\n2.  **Monitoring & Success Metrics:** We need to define nosso dashboards in Grafana. My draft dashboard (ID: `settlement-fix-PAY-8576`) tracks recon error rates from the `ReconEngine-Prod` BigQuery dataset and p99 latency for the settlement job. The success criteria should be: zero increase in INR settlement failures and a drop in FX recon errors to <0.05%.\n3.  **Rollback Plan:** If we see any critical errors (e.g., error code `SR-503` from Euler) or latency spikes above 1.5s, the immediate action is to disable the feature flag. We need to confirm the alerting setup in PagerDuty and the on-call DRI for this rollout.\n\nLet's come out of this meeting with a concrete timeline and clear owners for each step of the rollout.

As tracked in PAY-8735, the p99 latency for our risk service jumped from a baseline of ~150ms to over 800ms for a period of 45 minutes, causing downstream timeouts in the payment-gateway. This is a critical follow-up to our Slack thread where we first flagged the issue.\n\nMy initial look at the Grafana dashboard (link: grafana.juspay.in/d/risk-engine-prod-latency) suggests a strong correlation with DB connection pool exhaustion. Priya's initial analysis pointed to a specific set of complex rules that were part of the `risk-ruleset-v3.1.2` deployment which went live just before the incident. I think we need to confirm if this new ruleset is causing inefficient query patterns under load. The goal here is to get to a definitive root cause and agree on a path forward.\n\nProposed agenda: 1) Priya to walk us through the Kibana logs for the impacted timeframe. 2) We'll discuss immediate mitigation: should we rollback the ruleset, or can we apply a hotfix to optimize the DB queries? 3) Define clear action items. My suggestion for next steps would be: a) Arjun (me) to prepare a config change to increase the DB connection pool as a temporary buffer (ETA: EOD today), and b) Sneha to review the business logic of the new rules to see if they can be simplified without compromising fraud detection efficacy.

Grafana dashboard 'payments-errors' confirms a spike in HTTP 504 responses from our internal `mandate-processor` service, coinciding with a silent failure of the `icici-token-refresher` Kubernetes cron job. This job is responsible for renewing the 60-minute TTL bearer token and updating the corresponding key (`icici:mandate:oauth:token`) in our `redis-cluster-01` instance. The root cause was a pod eviction on the `k8s-prod-payments-east` cluster due to node resource contention, which prevented the token from being renewed at its scheduled 55-minute interval.","Our Go-based HTTP client's interceptor logic for the ICICI integration does not currently handle a `401 Unauthorized` response by triggering an on-demand token refresh. Instead, the default retry mechanism (3 attempts with exponential backoff) repeatedly sent requests with the expired token. This exhausted the connection pool to the ICICI gateway, resulting in the upstream timeouts. The ICICI API gateway correctly returned `err_code: 'INVALID_TOKEN'` with the 401 status, but our service misinterpreted this as a transient network issue rather than an authentication failure that required a distinct remediation path via the `/oauth/v2/token` endpoint.","The immediate mitigation is a manual execution of the `icici-token-refresher` job and a forced flush of the stale Redis key. For a permanent solution tracked under PAY-3599, the `mandate-processor` service's client interceptor will be modified to recognize the `401 Unauthorized` status. Upon detection, it will programmatically invoke a new gRPC call to a dedicated `auth-service`, which will handle the token refresh and cache update atomically, ensuring subsequent retries use a valid credential.

The primary failure point is the synchronous call to the CKYC registry via our Karza API gateway, which frequently returns a `CKYC_TIMEOUT_408` error. This occurs when the name-matching algorithm against the central repository exceeds the gRPC service's 1200ms timeout threshold, particularly for profiles with name variations or multiple linked identifiers. This directly impacts our ability to comply with NPCI's data localization mandate, as these incomplete profiles are left in a transient state in our MongoDB session store instead of being persisted to the audited Aurora cluster in `ap-south-1`.","The root cause is twofold: a rigid timeout configuration and an inadequate fallback mechanism. The current exception handler for `CKYC_TIMEOUT_408` incorrectly routes the user session to a generic error page, terminating the flow instead of triggering the intended escalation to the manual verification queue within our internal `compliance-dashboard`. This prevents compliance officers from intervening and completing the Video-KYC (V-KYC) process, which is the prescribed next step for such failures. The issue is exacerbated by the lack of a circuit breaker pattern in the `kyc-orchestrator`, leading to cascading failures during peak load when the Karza API response times degrade system-wide.","To address this for the upcoming NPCI audit readiness (JIRA: PAY-6476), we must re-architect the CKYC lookup as an asynchronous workflow. The `kyc-orchestrator` should dispatch the request and use a webhook or a polling mechanism against a new Redis queue to await the result, freeing up the main thread. Secondly, the exception handler must be updated to correctly interpret the `CKYC_TIMEOUT_408` and other 4xx/5xx class errors as non-terminal, creating a task in the `compliance-dashboard` with all gathered data (DigiLocker PII, internal risk score).

All payment data, from transaction authorization to final settlement, is processed and stored exclusively within our Mumbai (DC-BOM-1) and Chennai (DC-MAA-1) data centers. No payment system data or personally identifiable information is stored or replicated outside India's borders.\n\n**System Architecture and Data Flow:**\n\n1.  **FX Rate Sourcing:** Our internal `Forex Engine` service fetches real-time rates via secure API calls to our banking partners. These API endpoints are whitelisted, and all traffic is encrypted using TLS 1.3. The p99 latency for our `RateProvider API` is consistently below 150ms.\n\n2.  **Settlement Initiation:** The `SettlementOrchestrator` service processes batches for foreign currency settlements. For major currency pairs (e.g., INR/USD, INR/EUR), we currently operate on a T+2 settlement cycle. All transaction metadata, including the applied FX rate and timestamp, is logged and stored in our `pg-settlements-cluster-bom1` PostgreSQL database, which resides solely in the Mumbai DC.\n\n3.  **Data Segregation:** We enforce strict logical and physical data segregation. Audit logs are continuously generated, capturing every data access event. These logs are ingested into our Kibana instance (log-stack-mum-1), which is also hosted within India, allowing for complete traceability.\n\n**Process Optimization (JIRA PAY-9552):**\n\nWe are actively working on optimizing the reconciliation process for multi-currency transactions, tracked under ticket JIRA PAY-9552. Our current automated reconciliation achieves a 99.85% success rate, with manual intervention required for discrepancies typically arising from FX rate volatility between transaction and settlement times.\n\nThe enhancements in PAY-9552 involve deploying a new reconciliation module that uses a time-weighted average price (TWAP) model to flag discrepancies. We are targeting a reduction in manual reconciliation cases by 80% and aiming for a final, fully reconciled state within T+1 for 95% of transactions.\n\nOur Grafana dashboard (`Settlements-Performance-Multicurrency`) tracks batch processing times, success/failure rates, and reconciliation variances.

This builds on the initial alert from email d2a3bc91a7fd4c07.\n\nDuring simulated load tests hitting 10K TPS in the staging environment, we observed the following:\n\n*   **Latency Spike:** The p99 latency for the primary transaction authorization endpoint (`/cbs/v2/payment/auth`) is reaching 1.9s, which is significantly above our 350ms SLA for this service.\n*   **Error Rate Increase:** This latency is causing downstream timeouts, resulting in a 3.2% spike in `503 Service Unavailable` errors at the UPI gateway level.\n*   **Root Cause Indicators:** The Grafana dashboard for the CBS migration cluster shows sustained I/O wait times on the primary PostgreSQL instance. Kibana logs (index: `cbs-migration-prod-logs-*`) confirm this, showing a high frequency of `DEADLOCK_DETECTED` errors during concurrent write operations, especially when the settlement reconciliation job runs parallel to auth requests.\n\nFrom a risk perspective, this performance degradation is a critical blocker for the NPCI Data Localization Audit Readiness project (Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25). The transaction processing times we're seeing are in direct violation of the sub-second requirements outlined in the NPCI guidelines we reviewed (ref: file#fd31686801c94aad). We cannot proceed with the final data migration until this is resolved.\n\nAction items are as follows:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Rohan):** Please prioritize the investigation into the PostgreSQL deadlock issue. All relevant logs and traces have been attached to JIRA PAY-5204.\n2.  **DevOps (Priya):** Let's review the Kubernetes resource allocation and HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) policies for the new core banking service. It's possible the pods aren't scaling aggressively enough to handle the load, exacerbating the DB contention.\n3.  **Risk (Myself):** I will update the project's risk register and prepare a communication for the NPCI audit liaison regarding a potential delay in our readiness declaration.\n\nWe need to convene an emergency sync at 4:00 PM IST today to align on a mitigation strategy.

This issue is being tracked under JIRA PAY-7614 and appears distinct from the timeout-related discrepancies discussed in email 06f3ad650a664598.\n\nHere are the technical specifics:\n\n1.  **Mismatch Pattern:** Our HyperSettle engine is observing that transactions confirmed with a `SUCCESS` (response code '00') via our real-time `/payment/status` API checks are later appearing as `FAILED` (e.g., NPCI code 'U16' - Transaction not permitted to VPA) in the final settlement file. This contradicts the initial successful transaction state recorded in our system.\n\n2.  **System Logs:** Cross-referencing Kibana logs shows our UPI gateway received a valid success callback from NPCI's endpoint. The JWT tokens used for these API calls were valid, and we see no authentication or authorization errors on our end. The end-to-end latency for these specific transactions was within our SLA, averaging 210ms p99.\n\n3.  **Audit Impact:** This data integrity gap is a critical concern for the upcoming NPCI Data Localization Audit (Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25). As you know, RBI guidelines mandate that the end-to-end transaction lifecycle, including final settlement status, must be accurately stored and auditable within India.

We are observing a significant increase in API timeouts on our UPI gateway, directly correlating with failures in the OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow. This builds on the initial observations from email 23f0e583908547ee.\n\n**Technical Details & Impact Analysis:**\n\nOur Grafana monitoring dashboards show that starting around 14:30 IST yesterday, p99 latency for the `/v2/payments/initiate` endpoint spiked from a baseline of ~180ms to over 2.1s. This corresponds to a transaction error rate increase from 0.15% to approximately 4.2%.\n\nAnalysis of our Kibana logs indicates the root cause is a cascade failure originating from our authentication service. The service is intermittently failing to refresh expired JWT access tokens, resulting in a high volume of `401 Unauthorized` responses from downstream services. Unfortunately, our client-side retry mechanism is exacerbating the issue, leading to connection pool exhaustion and the observed timeouts.\n\nThe investigation, tracked under JIRA PAY-1123, suggests a potential race condition in how our Kubernetes authentication pods are managing the refresh tokens within their caching layer. This seems to have been introduced after our last security patch deployment.\n\n**Compliance Risk:**\nFrom a compliance perspective, this is a significant concern. The incomplete transactions are creating gaps in our audit trail. While the initial failed auth requests are logged, the full transaction lifecycle is not captured, which contravenes the data integrity requirements stipulated by RBI for payment systems. This presents a material risk for the upcoming data localization audit (Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25).\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Juspay:** Our SRE team is preparing to roll back the authentication service to the previous stable version in our staging environment to confirm the hypothesis. A full post-mortem (RCA) will be documented and shared within the next 24 hours.\n2.  **NPCI (Action Required):** Can you please confirm if any changes to rate-limiting policies or configurations were applied to your OAuth token endpoint (`/oauth/token`) within the last 48 hours? Any server-side logs you could share for requests from our egress IPs would be invaluable for cross-referencing our findings.\n\nWe need to ensure rock-solid stability and verifiable data trails ahead of the audit.

Our Kibana logs show that the primary errors returned by the `/v2/kyc/verify` endpoint are `DOC_MISMATCH_403` and `KYC_VALIDATION_TIMEOUT`. Our internal investigation, tracked under JIRA PAY-9870, suggests that our request payloads are correctly formatted according to the API specifications detailed in file#fd31686801c94aad.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this failure is critical. It creates a significant gap in our data lineage and processing logs, which are mandatory for demonstrating adherence to RBI's data localization directives. Without a successful KYC record, we cannot definitively prove that all payment transaction data for these users is stored and processed end-to-end within Indian data centers, a core requirement of the audit.\n\nOur engineering team has ruled out issues with our OAuth token generation and request signing process. The problem seems isolated to the validation logic itself. Could the NPCI team please investigate if any stricter validation rules or rate limits were recently deployed for high-risk profiles?

The current response payload does not return multi-currency data, which forces a manual lookup. Is there an alternative API endpoint or an extended version of this API that provides the full FX data for a given transaction ID? Without this, our p99 reconciliation latency for these specific transactions increases from 300ms to over 15 minutes.\n\n3.  **Audit Trail and Logging:** For the audit, we must provide an immutable log trail for the entire lifecycle of a multi-currency payment. Our systems log every API request/response and store them in our Kibana cluster, hosted in our Mumbai DC. Could you specify the exact event codes or transaction type identifiers that differentiate a multi-currency settlement from a standard INR one?

The issue is more severe than initially discussed in the thread on email bcb841981faa404b.\n\nHere are the specific findings:\n\n*   **Performance Metrics:** The Grafana `upi-gateway-prod` dashboard shows p99 latency for the `/v2/settlement/initiate` and `/v1/transaction/status` endpoints has degraded from a baseline of ~450ms to 2.2s during peak load (3 PM - 5 PM IST). This has caused our transaction processing throughput to drop by 18%, and we're seeing a spike in `504 Gateway Timeout` errors, which now exceed our 0.5% SLA threshold.\n\n*   **Root Cause Analysis (JIRA PAY-9964):** The infrastructure team's preliminary analysis points to severe database connection pool exhaustion in our primary PostgreSQL cluster. The new settlement module appears to be initiating long-running, unoptimized queries that hold connections open, starving other critical services. Kibana logs confirm a high frequency of `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for non-replication superuser connections`.\n\n*   **Compliance Impact:** This performance degradation presents a material compliance breach. Per RBI circular RBI/2017-18/153, all payment system data must be stored *and processed* exclusively within India. The current latency and timeout errors create a scenario where transaction data could be queued in-memory for extended periods before being committed to the database. This state of 'in-flight' data processing latency could be interpreted by an auditor as failing the real-time processing requirement, representing a critical audit finding. This risk was also flagged as a possibility in the pre-migration assessment (ref: file#fd31686801c94aad).\n\n**Immediate Action Items:**\n\n1.  **DBA Team:** Prioritize the analysis and optimization of the inefficient queries identified in JIRA PAY-9964. We need an immediate patch or a temporary rollback plan for the specific module. **Owner: @db-leads; ETA: 24 hours.**\n2.  **Infra/SRE Team:** Please evaluate short-term mitigation by vertically scaling the PG cluster and increasing the `max_connections` parameter. We need to understand the downstream impact of this change. **Owner: @sre-leads; ETA: EOD Today.**\n3.  **My Action (Compliance):** I will draft a risk memo detailing the issue, current impact, and remediation plan for the steering committee. This is crucial for transparency ahead of the audit. I will circulate the draft by tomorrow morning.\n\nWe must resolve this with urgency. The stability of our settlement system and our compliance posture are at stake.

Building on the initial findings from email 56994c0b07d94933, our analysis confirms a significant impact on transaction processing latency.\n\nOur UPI gateway is currently experiencing p99 response times of approximately 1.8s during peak load simulations in the staging environment. This is a substantial degradation from our baseline of <250ms and seems directly correlated with the new CBS integration points. The Grafana dashboard 'CBS-Migration-Performance' indicates a severe contention issue within the settlement reconciliation module, specifically during high-volume database write operations to the transaction ledger. While the overall error rate remains low at 0.2%, this latency violates our internal performance SLAs and, more importantly, could be flagged by auditors as a system stability concern.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, RBI guidelines require us to demonstrate not just data localization but also the operational resilience of the systems processing that data. The current performance metrics, tracked under JIRA PAY-6378, do not meet the expected standards for a production-ready system.\n\nTo mitigate this, the following actions are required:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Aditya Singh):** Prioritize the optimization of the database write operations for the settlement module. Please provide a detailed remediation plan and timeline by EOD tomorrow, 10/12.\n2.  **Compliance (Priya Nair):** I will begin drafting a risk mitigation addendum for our audit submission, referencing the technical analysis in file#fd31686801c94aad, to proactively address this potential finding with the audit team.\n3.  **NPCI Coordination:** We must formally communicate a revised timeline for our pre-audit testing.

While the optimization to achieve T+1 settlement is a significant business goal, we must ensure the implementation is fully compliant before proceeding.\n\nReferring to the architecture diagram in file#fd31686801c94aad, the proposed flow leverages a third-party FX rate service whose API endpoint and processing servers appear to be located outside of India. The RBI's directive on Storage of Payment System Data is explicit: all data related to payment systems, including transaction details and settlement information, must be stored and processed only within India.\n\nEven if the data sent to this external service is limited to currency pairs and amounts, the fact that it is part of the settlement instruction chain for a domestic payment could be interpreted by NPCI auditors as a violation. Our internal audit logs for the staging environment confirm that transaction reference IDs are being passed in the API calls to `/api/v3/settlement/initiate-multi-currency`, creating a direct link to payment data.\n\nTo mitigate this risk for Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25, we have two potential paths forward:\n\n1.  **Onboard an India-hosted FX Rate Provider:** Source a provider whose entire infrastructure (API endpoints, processing, logging) is verifiably located within India.\n2.  **Internalize Rate Management:** Build a lightweight internal service that fetches and caches FX rates within our Mumbai DC. This would contain the entire process within our compliant infrastructure.\n\nThis finding has been documented in JIRA PAY-3565.

All processing, from transaction data ingestion to final settlement file generation, occurs entirely within our India-based data centers (Mumbai DC1, Chennai DC2). The entire data lifecycle for these transactions adheres strictly to RBI's data localization mandate. Sensitive payment data is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+), and never leaves our Indian servers. Audit logs confirming this are generated and stored immutably.\n\nAs discussed, we are actively optimizing this process. JIRA ticket PAY-9336 tracks the automation of our FX reconciliation logic. Currently, this involves a semi-manual check which introduces a 4-hour delay in our T+2 settlement cycle for non-INR currencies. Our Grafana metrics show the existing process maintains a 99.75% accuracy rate, but the goal of PAY-9336 is to achieve a fully automated T+1 cycle without compromising accuracy. The optimization involves enhancing our `/v2/settlement/initiate` endpoint to integrate directly with our treasury system's rate API, eliminating manual rate entry. The output is a consolidated settlement report accessible via a secure, JWT-based API.\n\nAs a follow-up to the query in email d2a3bc91a7fd4c07 and the requirement in file#fd31686801c94aad, we are finalizing a comprehensive data flow diagram for the multi-currency settlement process.

I suspect our Kubernetes ingress controller for the UPI gateway pods may have timed out these incoming connections, leading to the discrepancy. The internal audit logs for the settlement system itself are clean, confirming the issue is at the data ingestion boundary with NPCI.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint for the upcoming data localization audit, this presents a material weakness.

This is being tracked under JIRA PAY-3395.\n\nTechnically, the issue appears to stem from API calls to your `/verify/v2/customer` endpoint. Our Kibana logs show a pattern of `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` responses, which are often preceded by a `K51 - KYC Validation Timeout` error code from the NPCI gateway. The p99 latency for these failed requests is spiking to over 1500ms, well beyond our acceptable threshold of 800ms.

Specifically, our automated Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) process is failing for customer segments flagged as 'high-risk' by our internal fraud detection models.\n\nOur investigation, tracked under JIRA PAY-5133, reveals a failure rate of approximately 38% for this cohort. The root cause appears to be a `504 Gateway Timeout` when our KYC-Engine service calls a third-party verification API. Kibana logs for these failed requests consistently show response latencies exceeding our 3.5s threshold before the connection is dropped. This is in contrast to the p95 latency of 850ms for standard-risk profiles.\n\nThis forces a fallback to a manual verification workflow, which introduces a potential compliance gap. Our primary concern is ensuring that no PII or payment-sensitive data from these failed automated attempts is cached or logged in a manner that contravenes the data localization mandate, even temporarily. As outlined in the previous discussion (email 3f71c075dc3a492b), our architecture is designed to process and store all data within our India-based Kubernetes clusters.\n\nTo ensure our remediation strategy is fully compliant, we require clarification on the following point:\n\nIn the event of a timeout from an external, non-payment system during an EDD check, what is NPCI's guidance on handling the in-flight data? Is it permissible to queue the encrypted request payload within our India-hosted Redis instance for a maximum of three retry attempts over a 90-second window before purging? The alternative would be immediate failure and data purge, which impacts user experience.\n\nOur engineering team is already implementing a circuit breaker to isolate these failures and is exploring an optimized retry logic.

The audit trails are complete, and no payment data was processed or stored outside the designated geographic boundary, which aligns with the core requirement of the RBI mandate. The issue was purely one of logical routing.\n\nThe root cause has been traced to a recent change in our routing configuration that failed to correctly parse the issuer country code for a small subset of BINs. The engineering team has already prepared a patch.\n\nAction Items & Next Steps:\n1.  **Hotfix Deployment:** A patch correcting the rule logic is currently undergoing regression testing in our staging environment. We are targeting a production deployment during our next maintenance window tonight at 02:00 IST.\n2.  **Incident Report:** We have compiled a detailed post-mortem report (ref: file#fd31686801c94aad) for audit evidence, documenting the impact, root cause, and remediation steps. We will append this to our submission for the upcoming audit under Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25.\n3.  **Confirmation from NPCI:** Could you please confirm if your system logs show a corresponding spike in `U30` errors from our `juspay@axis` VPA handle during the specified time frame? This would help us ensure our monitoring is fully aligned with yours.\n\nWe will send a confirmation once the fix is live and our Grafana dashboards show the error rate has returned to its baseline of <0.01% for this transaction type.\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya Nair\nCompliance Specialist\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757920740000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["compliance-audit@npci.org.in","tech-integration@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

The KYC-Orchestrator service is consistently timing out when calling the external DigiLocker API for document verification, specifically for customers flagged by our internal risk engine (risk-model-v3). Our Grafana dashboard (KYC-Performance) shows a 72% failure rate for this specific segment since the last deployment. This corresponds to an average p99 latency of 4500ms on the `/v2/kyc/verify` endpoint, well above our 800ms SLA. This is being tracked under JIRA PAY-5624.\n\nKibana logs from the `kyc-orchestrator-*` index show repeated `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors. The infra team suspects our egress proxy configuration might not be correctly handling the increased payload size for these verification requests. The manual verification process is a temporary stopgap but is not scalable and presents its own compliance risks, as outlined in the risk assessment `file#fd31686801c94aad`.\n\nThis failure poses a significant risk for the NPCI audit. We cannot demonstrate fully automated, end-to-end data processing and storage within Indian data centers if a substantial portion of our KYC process falls back to manual intervention. This directly contravenes the RBI circular we discussed in `email#d2a3bc91a7fd4c07`.\n\nAction items are as follows:\n\n1.  **Priya (Infra):** Please investigate the egress proxy timeout issue by EOD today. Specifically, review the connection pool limits and request timeouts for the DigiLocker integration.\n2.  **Rohan (Eng):** Please coordinate with the KYC team to implement a more robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff for the `/v2/kyc/verify` call. A circuit breaker to prevent cascading failures should also be prioritized.\n3.  **Anjali (Self):** I will prepare a contingency plan for the audit, detailing our mitigation strategy, and update the risk register for Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25.\n\nLet's schedule a brief sync tomorrow at 10:00 AM IST to review progress on JIRA PAY-5624.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjali Patel"],"timestamp":1757920920000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","rohan.mehta@juspay.in","aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Our primary objective is to ensure full compliance with the RBI data localization directive for the upcoming audit, while optimizing the settlement flow for transactions involving foreign currencies.\n\nThe proposed solution, tracked under JIRA PAY-6425, ensures that all end-to-end payment data for transactions processed within India remains localized. Here is a high-level overview of the data flow:\n\n1.  **Data Segregation:** All transaction data, including card details, UPI VPAs, and customer PII, will be processed and stored exclusively within our Tier 3 data centers in Mumbai and Chennai. No payment-related data will be sent outside of India's borders.\n\n2.  **FX Rate Fetching:** For currency conversion, our settlement engine will make a server-to-server API call to an RBI-authorized service. This request will be strictly limited to non-sensitive data points (e.g., currency pair and transaction amount) and will not contain any information covered by the localization mandate.\n\n3.  **Reconciliation & Reporting:** We plan to enhance our existing settlement reconciliation reports to include multi-currency data. As per the draft specification in file#fd31686801c94aad, we propose adding `original_currency`, `original_amount`, and `fx_rate_applied` fields to the daily settlement report file (SRF). Our Grafana dashboards are being updated to monitor these new fields for discrepancies, with alerts configured for any variance exceeding 0.05%.\n\nTo proceed, we require clarification on two points:\n\n*   Can you confirm if this data segregation and anonymized FX lookup model aligns with NPCI’s interpretation of the data localization guidelines? The full technical architecture document is attached for your review.\n*   Regarding the proposed SRF changes, will your systems be able to ingest the modified format, or would you require a separate file for multi-currency settlements? This builds on our prior discussion in email#d2a3bc91a7fd4c07 regarding T+1 settlement cycles.\n\nWe are targeting a staging deployment for this new flow by the end of next month to begin performance testing. Our goal is to maintain our current P99 latency of <250ms for the entire settlement process.\n\nCould we schedule a 30-minute technical sync next week to walk through the architecture and resolve these open questions?\n\nRegards,\n\nRohit Sharma\nBusiness Development Manager\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757921400000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["compliance-team@npci.org.in","tech-integration@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

A misconfiguration in the payment gateway's routing logic appears to be the definitive cause, directly impacting our stated compliance posture for the NPCI Data Localization Audit (Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25).\n\n**Incident Details & Compliance Impact:**\nBetween 14:30 and 15:15 IST, a deployment to the routing service resulted in approximately 2,150 domestic UPI transactions being incorrectly routed through our international gateway. Kibana logs confirm these transactions originated from Indian issuers and were destined for domestic merchants, yet their payment data was processed outside of India. This is a direct violation of RBI's data localization mandate.\n\nThe engineering team, tracking this under JIRA PAY-2226, rolled back the configuration at 15:17 IST. Our Grafana dashboards show the error rate for `Error Code: 41_INVALID_ROUTE_GEO` dropped from a peak of 1.2% back to the baseline of <0.01% immediately post-rollback. This confirms the initial hypothesis from Aditya in email `0a5e128745354a8f`.\n\nA full list of affected `transaction_ids` and corresponding `trace_ids` has been compiled and is available in `file#fd31686801c94aad` for our audit trail.\n\n**Required Actions:**\n1.  **Compliance/Legal:** I am preparing the formal incident report. We must assess the mandatory reporting requirements to NPCI and RBI by EOD tomorrow.\n2.  **Engineering:** The CI/CD pipeline for the routing service needs an automated pre-flight check to validate routing rules against a control list of domestic-only BINs. This needs to be prioritized.\n3.  **SRE:** Please implement a new alert in our monitoring system to trigger if the transaction count on the international payment endpoint deviates by more than 3 standard deviations from the 30-day rolling average.\n\nThis incident will be flagged as a high-priority item in our audit readiness documentation.

For the long-term, we need to scope the engineering effort to enhance the rule engine or potentially integrate a secondary verification provider.\n\nOur goal is to leave this meeting with clear owners and ETAs.

The NPCI audit team has requested evidence of data integrity by the end of this week, and the ₹4.7L discrepancy from Tuesday's settlement batch is a direct blocker. Suresh's analysis on BigQuery confirms the issue is isolated to transactions processed between 18:05 and 18:20 IST, a window where our primary UPI gateway TPS peaked at over 18k.\n\nThe leading theory, based on Ravi's investigation of the Euler ledger logs, points to a race condition. It seems our ledger service is marking transactions as 'settled' based on an initial success response, but it's failing to correctly update records when a delayed 'reversal' status is received from the NPCI-side switch a few seconds later. This isn't a data loss issue but a state reconciliation failure, which is a critical finding for the data localization audit.\n\nProposed path forward and decisions from this sync:\n1.  **Immediate Fix:** Ravi will implement a hotfix in the Euler ledger's reconciliation service. The fix will introduce a 'settlement_pending' state for up to 60 seconds post-transaction, allowing the service to properly ingest any subsequent status updates from NPCI before finalization. Owner: Ravi Kumar, ETA: Tomorrow, EOD. The PR must be linked to PAY-7503.\n2.  **Data Correction:** Once the hotfix is deployed to staging and validated, Suresh will run a correction script to update the state of the ~3,500 affected transactions from Tuesday.

The responses consistently contain the NPCI-specific error payload: {\"errorCode\": \"U99\", \"errorDesc\": \"Throughput limit exceeded\"}. This throttling is creating a significant backlog in verifying the final state of transactions stored in our primary ScyllaDB cluster, jeopardizing the completion timeline for the data localization audit as specified in JIRA ticket PAY-1152.","The current implementation within ReconEngine utilizes a fixed-interval retry policy (3 attempts at 500ms intervals), which inadvertently amplifies the issue by creating a thundering herd effect against the NPCI gateway during traffic bursts. Our Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) is functioning correctly by scaling ReconEngine pods, confirming the bottleneck is external rather than an internal resource limitation. The fixed retry logic is configured directly in the application code and does not leverage service-mesh-level (Istio) traffic management, representing a point of immediate improvement.","As an immediate mitigation, the SRE team must deploy a hotfix to ReconEngine that replaces the fixed-interval retry with an exponential backoff strategy incorporating jitter for all U99-related failures. This will de-synchronize retry attempts and distribute the load more effectively.

Our Grafana dashboards (ref: `payments-errors`) show throttling begins when our aggregate transaction processing system (TPS) exceeds approximately 450, despite the documented limit being 500 TPS. This discrepancy is causing an average 7% transaction failure rate with the internal error code `TXN_FAILURE_THROTTLED` during these periods, directly impacting our SLA commitments and posing a risk for the upcoming data localization audit which mandates predictable data flow. The current retry mechanism, employing a simple exponential backoff, is proving insufficient and is exacerbating p99 latency by up to 800ms.","To ensure stable transaction throughput and audit readiness, we must implement a more sophisticated client-side traffic shaping mechanism. The proposed solution involves deploying an adaptive rate limiter using a distributed token bucket algorithm, with the token state managed centrally in our primary Redis cluster.

Furthermore, we will integrate a Resilience4j-based circuit breaker pattern configured to trip if the `HTTP 429` error rate from the NPCI gateway surpasses 3% over a 60-second rolling window. When the circuit is open, new payment initializations will be prioritized while lower-priority API calls, such as `/status/check`, will be shunted to a dedicated Kafka topic (`npci_status_check_deferred`) for asynchronous processing once the circuit closes.","Immediate action items under JIRA PAY-8550 are as follows: 1) The engineering team is to prototype the Redis-backed token bucket and configure the Resilience4j circuit breaker within the `payment-orchestrator` service. 2) I will formally engage with our NPCI technical account manager to clarify the effective TPS limit and investigate the observed 450 TPS threshold. 3) The SRE team must create a new Grafana dashboard to specifically monitor the circuit breaker's state (open, closed, half-open) and the depth of the `npci_status_check_deferred` Kafka queue.

This analysis pertains to Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25.\n\nBuilding on the architecture overview in file 3853b6aba7484ef6, our investigation focused on the `forex-settlement-service`. Kibana logs from the production cluster indicate that for non-INR settlements (specifically involving USD, EUR, and GBP), the service makes an external API call to `/v3/latest/rates` for currency conversion data. Unfortunately, this endpoint resolves to a server hosted in AWS `eu-west-1`. This constitutes a clear violation of the RBI's data localization circular (RBI/2017-18/153), which requires all data related to payment systems to be stored and processed only within India.\n\nWhile this is reference data, its use within the settlement authorization flow means it falls under the audit's scope. The current p95 latency for this API call is a stable ~95ms, which is well within our settlement batch window of T+1. However, any solution must maintain or negligibly impact this performance to avoid breaching our 99.9% settlement success SLA.\n\nThe engineering team has outlined two potential paths forward in JIRA PAY-5139:\n\n1.  **Internal Forex Cache Service:** Develop and deploy a microservice within our Mumbai GCP region (`asia-south1`) that caches rates from an approved, India-hosted data source. This provides us full control but has development and maintenance overhead.\n2.  **Direct Integration with Local Provider:** Switch to a pre-approved, India-domiciled financial data provider's API. This is faster to implement, but we are seeing projected p99 latencies of around 140ms in their sandboxes, which could be a concern during peak settlement volumes.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Rohan (Infra Lead):** Can you provide a high-level resource and timeline estimate for option 1 by our sync on Thursday? We need to understand the Kubernetes pod allocation and potential database requirements.\n*   **Anjali (Product):** Could you please engage with the vendor for option 2 to get a firm commitment on production latency SLAs and finalize the commercial terms by EOW?\n*   **Myself (Priya):** I will begin drafting the revised data flow diagrams and the risk assessment addendum for both scenarios. The goal is to have a decision-ready comparison for the NPCI audit team by next Monday.\n\nWe need to have a final decision on the path forward by the end of this week to meet the audit submission deadline. Please come prepared to discuss the trade-offs in our next meeting.\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya Nair\nCompliance Specialist\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757912820000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.mehra@juspay.in","anjali.verma@juspay.in","compliance-team-dl@juspay.in","payments-engineering-leads@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This involves nostro account reconciliation and generates distinct settlement files. While fully compliant with RBI's data localization mandate, this segregated process adds complexity for audit trail verification, as it requires correlating data across multiple reconciliation systems.\n\nWe are proposing an optimization, tracked internally as JIRA PAY-9538, to unify this flow. The objective is to integrate multi-currency settlement into our primary T+1 domestic settlement cycle. This involves modifying our core settlement engine to fetch real-time forex conversion rates via our banking partner's API and generate a single, consolidated settlement file for all transaction types. The technical specification for this new unified file format is outlined in file#3853b6aba7484ef6.\n\nFrom a risk and compliance perspective, this change significantly strengthens our audit posture. It provides a single, immutable source of truth for all transactions processed, simplifying the verification of end-to-end data residency. All transaction and conversion metadata will be logged in our Kibana cluster with specific audit tags, ensuring complete traceability within our India-based Kubernetes infrastructure.\n\nTo move forward with this initiative for Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25, we require clarification on the following:\n\n1.  Can NPCI's current settlement reporting endpoint ingest a consolidated file containing both domestic (INR) and foreign currency-equivalent transaction data?\n2.  Are there specific flags or fields required in the report header to properly route these consolidated batches within your system?\n\nWe believe this process optimization is a critical step towards demonstrating robust and streamlined compliance. We are prepared to schedule a technical deep-dive with your team to discuss the proposed data flow and file specifications at your earliest convenience.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757913180000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["npci.audit@npci.org.in","settlements.team@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This occurs despite our JWTs being valid and well within their expiry. The failure rate for token refreshes has hit 4.5% in the last 24 hours. When a refresh fails, our system is forced into a full re-authentication flow, which is adding significant latency.\n\n- **Performance Impact:** Our Grafana dashboard shows p99 latency for the primary UPI payment initiation endpoint spiking from a baseline of 220ms to 1.9s. This is directly impacting user experience and transaction success rates.\n- **Log Evidence:** Kibana logs (query attached in file#3853b6aba7484ef6) confirm our service is receiving the `invalid_grant` response.

This is directly related to Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25.\n\nOur `SettlementEngine` currently leverages a `ForexRateProvider` service for real-time currency conversion. While our primary transaction data resides correctly within our Aurora DB cluster in the `ap-south-1` (Mumbai) region, the data lifecycle for the foreign exchange rate itself requires immediate verification. The core of the issue is ensuring that every data point related to the FX conversion is stored locally *before* being processed, as mandated by the RBI's data localization circular.\n\nHere are the specific concerns:\n\n1.  **Data Ingress:** We need to confirm that the API endpoints our `ForexRateProvider` service calls for rates are not routing any Juspay-originated transaction identifiers or PII outside of India. We must also ensure the full, raw response from the FX provider is logged and stored within our Indian data centers before the settlement calculation proceeds.\n\n2.  **Audit Trail:** For the audit, we must be able to demonstrate an unbroken chain of data residency. This means querying our Kibana logs and the `settlements_db.transactions_forex` table to prove that the currency pair, timestamp, queried rate, and provider source were all captured and persisted locally. Any failure here would represent a critical audit finding.\n\n3.  **Process Optimization Impact:** The proposed optimization to the multi-currency process must incorporate these localization requirements from the design phase. Simply improving settlement speed without addressing the data residency of the FX component will not be sufficient for compliance.\n\nTo address this, I have created JIRA ticket PAY-9018. The immediate action items are:\n\n*   **Engineering Team:** Please conduct a thorough review of the `ForexRateProvider` service architecture. We need a definitive data flow diagram and confirmation on the data residency of its upstream APIs by end of this week.\n*   **Compliance (Myself):** I will update the master compliance checklist (ref `file#3853b6aba7484ef6`) to include specific controls for third-party FX data handling and logging.\n\nLet's schedule a 30-minute sync for early next week with the Payments Engineering and Product teams to align on the findings and any required remediation plan.

This is a critical follow-up to the initial alert from email 2fdc192d11c24139, as it directly impacts our readiness for the upcoming NPCI Data Localization Audit.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\nBetween approximately 14:30 and 15:15 IST, our Grafana monitoring showed p99 latency for the `/v2/risk/evaluate` endpoint increasing from a baseline of ~180ms to a sustained peak of over 850ms. This occurred during a high-volume period, with transaction throughput hovering around 45k TPS. The direct impact was a rise in transaction timeouts, pushing our API error rate from 0.12% to 0.35% for the affected merchants.\n\nMy initial investigation, detailed in JIRA PAY-2827, points away from a Kubernetes pod resource issue; CPU and memory utilization remained well within acceptable thresholds. Log analysis in Kibana, however, reveals a significant increase in query execution times against the primary PostgreSQL instance that houses our transactional data. The timing strongly suggests a correlation with the new fraud rule set (ID: FR-V4-72) that was deployed at 14:00 IST.\n\nThis performance degradation is a major concern. Consistent, low-latency risk scoring is a cornerstone of our compliance argument with NPCI and our adherence to RBI's guidelines on real-time payment processing.\n\n**Immediate Actions & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Mitigation:** I have disabled the new `FR-V4-72` rule set via the risk admin console as of 15:20 IST. System latency has since returned to the normal ~180ms range, confirming the rule's impact. This is a temporary measure.\n2.  **Rohan (Dev Team):** Could your team please perform a query analysis on the rules within `FR-V4-72`? I suspect an un-indexed or overly complex query on the transaction history table is the root cause. The details are in the attached file#3853b6aba7484ef6.\n3.  **Aditya (SRE):** Can you corroborate this by pulling the slow query logs from the `pg-primary-instance-01` for the 14:30-15:15 IST window and share them on PAY-2827?\n\nWe need a permanent fix deployed and validated by EOD tomorrow to ensure stability.

This directly correlates with an increased error rate of approximately 4.5% during peak token refresh windows.\n*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Our Grafana dashboards show that p99 latency for calls to NPCI’s `/token` endpoint is intermittently exceeding our 1500ms timeout threshold. Digging into Kibana logs, our authentication service is receiving an `invalid_grant` error from your server when attempting to refresh a JWT. The odd part is that a subsequent attempt with the exact same refresh token often succeeds within milliseconds.\n*   **Business Impact:** This instability poses a direct risk to the successful completion of the NPCI Data Localization Audit (Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25), as it impacts the transaction integrity and logging required for compliance with RBI guidelines.

Specifically, the `/upi/v2/payment/request` endpoint begins returning `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors once this threshold is breached.\n\nHere are the key metrics observed from our Grafana monitoring dashboard:\n\n*   **Observed TPS Limit:** ~4,000 TPS\n*   **Resulting Error Rate:** 1.8% during peak simulation (14:00-14:30 IST)\n*   **P99 Latency Spike:** Increased from a baseline of 210ms to over 850ms during throttling events.\n*   **Impacted Service:** Juspay UPI Gateway (prod-upi-gw)\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this throttling presents a significant operational risk. An inability to handle peak transactional volume could be flagged as a service availability issue during the audit, potentially impacting our compliance posture under RBI's guidelines for payment system resilience. Our internal mitigation efforts, tracked under JIRA PAY-2793, include implementing an exponential backoff mechanism in our Kubernetes services, but this is a temporary fix for a server-side limitation.\n\nTo resolve this ahead of the audit, we request the following:\n\n1.  **Confirmation:** Can you please confirm if the 4,000 TPS limit is the intended configuration for our production credentials?\n2.  **Limit Increase:** We formally request an evaluation to increase our rate limit to a minimum of 10,000 TPS to ensure sufficient headroom for organic growth and seasonal peaks.\n3.  **Documentation:** Could you provide the official technical documentation detailing the rate-limiting policies, including burst capacity, cooldown logic, and any associated error codes beyond the standard HTTP 429?\n\nWe are available to sync with your API platform team to discuss our traffic projections and system architecture.

A deep dive into the Kibana logs suggests the new rule set deployed last Tuesday is likely the root cause; it appears overly aggressive in flagging transactions originating from certain network blocks in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this poses two immediate problems:\n\n1.  **Audit Trail Integrity:** The high volume of declined, legitimate transactions skews our payment failure metrics. This could be misinterpreted by NPCI auditors as a systemic processing issue rather than an overzealous fraud filter, complicating our demonstration of compliance with RBI's data storage and processing guidelines.\n2.  **Reporting Accuracy:** The skewed failure data compromises the integrity of our regulatory reports, which must accurately reflect system performance and transaction outcomes.\n\nAs discussed in JIRA PAY-5839, we need to mitigate this immediately to remain on schedule for Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25.

This reply builds upon the high-level requirements discussed in email 41dd7b35fe3f4b2a and addresses the concerns Meera raised in email 75c9d9c1dd104b7f regarding potential delays in T+1 settlement for cross-border transactions.\n\nThe core of our proposed solution, detailed in the analysis document (ref: file#3853b6aba7484ef6), involves the development of a dedicated 'Forex Settlement Microservice'. This service will be containerized and deployed exclusively within our Kubernetes cluster in the Mumbai DC, ensuring all data processing and storage—including transient cache data—adheres strictly to RBI's data residency requirements.\n\nHere is the proposed data flow for your review:\n1.  **Forex Rate Ingestion:** At the beginning of each T+0 settlement window, the service will make an API call to a certified source to fetch the day's forex rates (e.g., for USD, EUR, SGD to INR).\n2.  **Transaction Enrichment:** The service will process our internal transaction logs, enrich each foreign currency transaction with the fetched conversion rate, and calculate the final INR settlement amount.\n3.  **Settlement File Generation:** The enriched data will be used to generate the final settlement file for NPCI. We project this enrichment process will add a latency of approximately 150ms per 10,000 transactions, which is well within our existing 45-minute settlement batch processing SLA.\n\nTo proceed, we require clarification on a few technical points from your end:\n\n*   **Forex API Endpoint:** Does NPCI provide a standard, certified API endpoint for fetching daily forex rates? If not, could you provide a list of RBI-approved third-party providers? This is a crucial detail for our audit trail.\n*   **Settlement File Specification:** We need the updated file specification for multi-currency settlements. Specifically, we need to confirm the exact field names and data types for 'OriginalCurrency', 'OriginalAmount', 'ConversionRate', and 'SettledINR_Amount'.\n*   **Error Handling Protocol:** Our current design proposes that in case of an API timeout or a 503 error from the forex rate provider, the system will raise a critical alert in our Grafana dashboard, halt the specific multi-currency batch, and automatically re-attempt processing in the next cycle. Is this fallback mechanism acceptable from a compliance standpoint?\n\nWe have created JIRA PAY-6926 to track the development and deployment of this microservice.\n\n**Action Items:**\n*   **NPCI:** Please provide the documentation for the forex rate API and the updated settlement file format by EOD, Friday.\n*   **Juspay:** We will draft a detailed sequence diagram and API contract for the new microservice pending your feedback.\n\nCould we schedule a 30-minute technical sync early next week with our respective engineering leads to finalize the architecture?\n\nRegards,\n\nRohit Sharma\nBusiness Development Manager | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757916360000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["siddharth.verma@npci.org.in","meera.iyer@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This has direct implications for our NPCI Data Localization Audit Readiness (Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25).\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n\nKibana logs from our UPI gateway service confirm that between 14:00 and 16:30 IST yesterday, a subset of international transactions was incorrectly routed. Specifically, payment requests with non-INR currency codes (e.g., USD, SGD) were directed to the domestic acquiring endpoint instead of the designated cross-border processing flow. This resulted in a `Response Code: 58 (Invalid Transaction)` from the NPCI API for approximately 1.2% of our international transaction volume during that period.\n\nThe issue stems from a faulty routing rule within the `cross-border-router` microservice deployed in our production Kubernetes cluster. It appears a change deployed last week failed to correctly parse the `transaction.currency` field in the payment initiation request payload under certain edge conditions.\n\n**Compliance Impact:**\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this misrouting represents a deviation from the data flow architecture submitted to the RBI as part of our localization compliance documentation (ref: file#3853b6aba7484ef6). Although all transaction data remained encrypted and within our India-based data centers, this architectural variance is a finding we must proactively address and document for the upcoming audit.\n\n**Action Plan & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Hotfix Deployment (JIRA: PAY-1595):** The engineering team has developed a patch to correct the routing logic. This is currently undergoing regression testing and is scheduled for deployment to the staging environment by 19:00 IST today.\n2.  **Validation:** Post-deployment, our QA team will execute a comprehensive test suite to validate the fix, simulating at least 10,000 TPS with mixed currency codes to ensure routing is restored to 100% accuracy.\n3.  **Incident Report:** We are compiling a full post-mortem report, including affected transaction IDs, Grafana dashboard snapshots of the error spike, and log evidence. This report will be shared with your team by EOD tomorrow.\n4.  **Preventative Measures:** We are enhancing our CI/CD pipeline to include automated checks that validate routing rules against a matrix of currency codes and transaction types before any future production deployments.\n\nWe will provide a formal update with the full incident report and evidence of the successful fix to ensure full transparency for the audit.

This issue is being tracked internally under JIRA PAY-7808.\n\nThe problem appears isolated to customer segments flagged by our internal fraud detection engine. Our Grafana monitoring shows that calls from our KYC service to the internal `/v2/risk/evaluate` endpoint are experiencing intermittent `504 Gateway Timeout` errors. This is primarily happening during peak onboarding hours (approx. 10:00 - 11:30 AM IST), leading to a failure cascade in the primary `/v1/kyc/verify` service.\n\nThe failure rate for this specific high-risk segment has spiked to 8.2%, a significant deviation from our baseline of <0.5%. This results in a `KYC_AUTOMATION_UNAVAILABLE` error being propagated to the merchant-facing systems. Kibana log analysis, a summary of which was shared in file#3853b6aba7484ef6, confirms the timeout originates from the risk-scoring service. For clarity, this service, its databases, and all related processing are hosted in our AWS ap-south-1 (Mumbai) region, in strict adherence to RBI’s data localization mandate.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective for the upcoming audit (Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25), our immediate concern is the fallback process. Currently, these failed automation attempts are routed to a manual verification queue. Our operations team then performs the KYC check using locally stored identity documents, and all audit trails for this manual process are maintained within our India-based infrastructure.\n\nCould you please provide clarification on whether this manual fallback procedure, with its fully localized evidence trail, is considered a compliant interim measure under the NPCI data localization guidelines?

Currently, our settlement engine processes these transactions, achieving a T+1 cycle for volumes that can peak at around 5,000 TPS. Our analysis, detailed in file#3853b6aba7484ef6, indicates a potential ambiguity in how transient data from the forex conversion leg is handled by the existing NPCI settlement APIs.\n\nWe need to validate the following to finalize our compliance report:\n\n1.  **API Data Fields:** Can you confirm if the `/payments/v2.1/settlement/initiate` endpoint supports dedicated fields for `original_currency`, `forex_rate_applied`, and a `conversion_timestamp`? Our current implementation passes this information within a generic metadata object, which may not be sufficient for audit logging.\n\n2.  **Data Residency Guarantee:** For transactions initiated in a foreign currency, is there an explicit guarantee that all data points, including the initial currency and amount, remain within NPCI's India-based data centers throughout the authorization and settlement lifecycle? Our audit logs from Kibana currently lack a definitive flag to trace this for specific transaction IDs.\n\n3.  **Error Handling for Forex Failures:** If a forex conversion fails post-authorization, the current error codes seem generic. Are there specific error codes planned to distinguish between a standard settlement failure and a forex-related issue? This is critical for our automated reconciliation and alert systems configured in Grafana.\n\nThis entire workstream is being tracked internally under JIRA ticket PAY-8892. To ensure we meet the audit deadlines, could you please provide the relevant API documentation and confirm the data residency posture for these specific scenarios by next Tuesday, June 18th?\n\nA technical sync call next week with our engineering leads would also be highly beneficial to align on the required implementation.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757917620000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["tech-support@npci.org.in","compliance@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This has direct implications for our ongoing NPCI Data Localization Audit Readiness (Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25), and we are sharing the details with full transparency.\n\nA misconfiguration in a Kubernetes ConfigMap for our primary payment ingress controller resulted in a small fraction of cross-border transactions initiated via the `/v2/payments/initiate` endpoint being partially logged outside our designated India data center. Specifically, a subset of transaction metadata (trace IDs and user-agent strings) for approximately 0.3% of non-Indian BIN transactions were inadvertently written to our edge caching layer in our Singapore region.\n\nThe anomaly was detected via our 'Cross-Border-Txn-Latency' Grafana dashboard, which showed a p99 latency spike to 1.8s for the affected transaction cohort, deviating from the ~450ms baseline. Our on-call SRE team correlated this with alerts from our logging pipeline and immediately triggered a rollback. The root cause analysis and remediation steps are fully documented in JIRA ticket PAY-6526.\n\nTo be clear, no core payment information or sensitive cardholder data (CHD) left Indian shores. The primary transaction processing and data storage remained fully compliant with RBI's guidelines as discussed in our prior communications (ref: email 2eb740295702479d and file#3853b6aba7484ef6). The issue was limited to transient, non-sensitive metadata logging due to the routing rule error.\n\nAction items on our end are as follows:\n1.  **Immediate:** The incorrect configuration was rolled back at 14:45 IST yesterday. All associated logs from the Singapore region have been purged, and we can provide a certificate of destruction.\n2.  **By EOW:** Our infrastructure team will implement stricter validation checks within our CI/CD pipeline to prevent recurrence of such routing rule deployments.\n3.  **By Next Week:** We will complete a full audit of all edge service configurations to ensure end-to-end compliance.\n\nWe believe this incident, while minor and quickly remediated, must be correctly documented for the upcoming audit.

This bottleneck directly impacts our progress on the NPCI Data Localization audit readiness for Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25.\n\nOur Grafana monitoring shows that while the system maintains sub-200ms P95 latency under 5,000 TPS, the response time for the UPI gateway's `/v2/payment/process` endpoint degrades sharply to 1.6s-2.1s as we approach our target of 15,000 TPS. This triggers a cascade of transaction timeouts, resulting in an error rate climbing to 3.5%, well above our 0.5% tolerance.\n\nAnalysis of Kibana logs correlated with database performance metrics indicates the primary issue is severe I/O contention on the newly migrated PostgreSQL cluster. It seems the current database sharding strategy is not adequately distributing write operations across nodes, leading to a bottleneck on the primary replica responsible for handling settlement ledger updates. This is particularly evident during peak load simulations that mirror end-of-day reconciliation traffic.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this performance issue presents a significant risk. The inability to process transactions within the mandated timeframe under peak load could jeopardize our ability to provide the required evidence of system stability and scalability as per RBI's guidelines. It also directly threatens our contractual 99.95% uptime SLA.\n\nTo address this, our infrastructure team has initiated two parallel workstreams tracked under JIRA PAY-8796:\n\n1.  **Database Re-architecting:** We are testing an alternative partitioning scheme based on a composite key (merchantID + timestamp) in our staging environment. Initial results are promising, showing a more even distribution of write-ahead log (WAL) activity.\n2.  **Request Throttling & Queuing:** We are implementing a transient Redis-based queuing layer to buffer ingress API requests during micro-bursts, smoothing the load on the database cluster.\n\nWe will have a conclusive report on the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies by Tuesday, September 10th.

The issue, tracked internally as JIRA PAY-1798, relates to the transient logging of masked PAN data outside of our certified Cardholder Data Environment (CDE).\n\n**Technical Details of the Finding:**\nOur investigation confirmed that our `upi-token-service`, running in a Kubernetes cluster, was intermittently logging request payloads at the DEBUG level during a specific fallback routine. This routine is triggered when our primary token vault latency exceeds a 250ms threshold, affecting approximately 0.15% of transactions during peak load (14:00-16:00 IST). These logs, containing masked PANs and other transaction metadata, were being streamed to our centralized Kibana instance in the AWS ap-south-1 (Mumbai) region. Although the data is masked and logs are purged on a 24-hour TTL via an automated lifecycle policy, the act of streaming and temporarily storing this data outside the hardened CDE constitutes a technical violation.\n\n**Impact on NPCI Data Localization Audit:**\nThis finding is directly relevant to our declaration of compliance with RBI's data localization mandate. We must demonstrate unequivocally that no payment system data, even transient or masked, resides or is processed outside of a strictly controlled and compliant boundary within India. This logging behavior, though contained within India, complicates our attestation.\n\n**Remediation and Action Items:**\n1.  **Immediate Containment (Completed):** At 15:00 IST today, we deployed a hotfix that changed the log level for the `upi-token-service` production environment from DEBUG to WARN. This immediately ceased the capture of the problematic request payloads. We have verified via Kibana that no new instances have been logged since the change.\n\n2.  **Permanent Solution (In Progress):** The engineering team is implementing a permanent fix within the application's logging middleware to explicitly redact the sensitive fields before any log serialization occurs. This change is undergoing final regression testing in our staging environment and is scheduled for production deployment by 18:00 IST, tomorrow.\n\n3.  **Evidence Package:** Upon completion, we will provide a comprehensive evidence package for your review. This will include the code commit diff for the middleware change, post-deployment log samples from Kibana confirming redaction, and an updated data flow diagram from `file#3853b6aba7484ef6`.\n\nWe would like to confirm if this remediation plan is sufficient to address this finding ahead of the formal audit. Additionally, could you please provide guidance on whether a formal breach notification is necessary in this context? Given the data was masked and the exposure was internal and transient, our interpretation is that it does not meet the threshold, but we defer to your expertise.\n\nWe are committed to resolving this with full transparency.\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya Nair\nCompliance Specialist\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757919000000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["compliance-audit@npci.org.in","pci.council@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

The root cause was a configuration drift within our `payment-router-v2.1` service, which directly impacts our data localization posture for the upcoming NPCI audit.\n\n**Technical Findings:**\n\nBetween 14:30 and 16:00 IST yesterday, a specific rule in the `routing_rules.yaml` file incorrectly directed transactions with international BINs to our domestic-only UPI gateway. This affected approximately 1,200 transactions, causing a 4.2% failure rate within that cohort. Our Kibana logs show these transactions were erroneously tagged with `Error Code: 51 (Insufficient Funds)` from the NPCI gateway, which was misleading. The actual failure occurred at our end before the request was properly formed for the correct international processing channel.\n\nThis misrouting is a clear deviation from RBI's data localization mandate. For a brief period, sensitive payment data from foreign-issued cards was processed by a system not designated or hardened for such data, even if it wasn't persistently stored. This is precisely the kind of process gap the NPCI audit for Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25 is designed to find.\n\nThe detailed log analysis supporting this is available in `file#3853b6aba748ef6`.\n\n**Action Items & Remediation:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Hotfix (Owner: Ravi Chandra):** A corrected `routing_rules.yaml` configuration has been pushed to a feature branch. The fix reverts the target gateway for the specified international BIN ranges. Deployment is slated for 18:00 IST today, post-haste after final sign-off. This is being tracked in JIRA PAY-5879.\n\n2.  **Enhanced Monitoring (Owner: DevOps Team):** The incident highlighted a gap in our monitoring. Our Grafana dashboards track overall success rates but lack specific alerts for routing logic violations. We need a new alert that triggers if any transaction with a foreign BIN is ever routed to a domestic-only endpoint. This needs to be implemented by EOW.\n\n3.  **Audit Documentation (Owner: Anjali Patel):** I will prepare a comprehensive incident report detailing the detection, root cause, and remediation steps. This will be proactively included in our audit submission to NPCI to demonstrate control maturity and transparent incident management.\n\nThis incident, while minor in transactional volume, is significant from a compliance standpoint.

This appears to be an unintended side effect of the new error handling logic discussed in email 2b8590285511494e.

We are escalating this with full transparency to ensure alignment ahead of the official audit.\n\n**Audit Finding Summary (Ref: JIRA PAY-6643):**\nOur internal audit team identified a scenario where transient transaction metadata containing sensitive cardholder data (CHD) could, under specific failure conditions, persist in-memory within our UPI gateway pods for a duration exceeding the mandated lifecycle. This was determined to be a potential deviation from PCI DSS Requirement 3.1, which mandates minimizing storage of sensitive data.\n\n**Technical Root Cause Analysis:**\nOur investigation confirmed the issue was not with our primary, India-domiciled encrypted databases. The root cause was located in the retry logic of our settlement reconciliation microservice. During simulated network partition tests where the primary database connection latency exceeded 450ms, the service's failover mechanism was incorrectly holding transaction objects in a local memory cache instead of immediately failing or redirecting the request. Analysis of Kibana logs and memory dumps confirmed this behavior, which was not previously identified in the performance discussions from email 17b6745d2bc54450.\n\n**Remediation Actions and Verification:**\n1.  **Hotfix Deployed:** A patch was immediately developed and deployed to our staging environment. This patch modifies the caching strategy to a strict write-through model with a non-negotiable Time-To-Live (TTL) of 150ms on any in-memory transaction object. If the object is not persisted within this window, it is deterministically purged and the transaction is failed with error code 504 (Gateway Timeout), preventing any data persistence anomalies.\n2.  **Verification Complete:** We have completed a full regression suite, including the original failure simulation. The new logic has proven 100% effective; no CHD persists in memory post-transaction. The detailed verification report and updated audit logs are attached (Ref: file#3853b6aba7484ef6).\n3.  **Enhanced Monitoring:** New alerts have been configured in our Grafana dashboard to monitor the p99 cache object age. An alert will now trigger a P1 incident if any object's in-memory lifetime exceeds 200ms, ensuring proactive detection.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nThe validated hotfix is scheduled for a rolling deployment to our production environment tonight between 02:00 and 04:00 AM IST to ensure no disruption to our transaction processing, which is currently operating at a 99.98% uptime SLA.\n\nWe are confident that this swift and comprehensive remediation fully addresses the audit finding and reinforces our commitment to robust data localization and security. We will provide a follow-up confirmation once the production deployment is successfully completed.\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya Nair\nCompliance Specialist\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757919900000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["audit-team@npci.org.in","compliance@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This requires your immediate attention as it deviates from the data flow architecture outlined in our previous discussions (ref: email fda41e861cd3460a) and the diagrams provided in file#3853b6aba7484ef6.\n\nOur internal security team, led by Aditya Singh, discovered that our UPI gateway's pre-authentication service was transiently caching unmasked Primary Account Numbers (PANs) in a Redis cluster located in our Mumbai (ap-south-1) region for approximately 350ms before routing to the designated NPCI endpoints. While this was designed to reduce latency during peak loads (we observed a 40ms improvement in p99 response times), it constitutes a direct violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 and the RBI's data localization circular.\n\nThe issue was identified through an analysis of Kibana logs from our Kubernetes pods running the `upi-pre-auth` service. We found clear-text PAN data in debug-level logs that were, until yesterday, being ingested into our centralized logging system. These logs have since been purged and the logging level has been adjusted.\n\nImmediate remediation is underway. Our engineering team has a hotfix in progress under JIRA PAY-8107. The proposed solution is to implement field-level encryption on the PAN data at the ingress controller, before it ever reaches the caching layer. This ensures that only an encrypted blob is stored transiently, which is then decrypted just before the final API call to NPCI's systems. We project a minor performance impact, likely an increase in latency of 15-20ms, which is well within our 99.9% uptime SLA threshold.\n\nWe need to align on this remediation plan to ensure it meets NPCI's compliance standards before we deploy to production. Could we schedule a 30-minute technical sync with your security and engineering teams early next week? We can present a full Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and walk through the proposed architectural change.\n\nPlease let us know your availability.\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":1757920500000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["compliance.team@npci.org.in","rahul.verma@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This analysis expands on the migration strategy outlined in the thread starting with email ad5ea297d5fe4e40.\n\nDuring simulated peak loads in our UAT environment, we observed a significant degradation in transaction processing. Specifically, the p99 latency for our primary UPI payment processing endpoint has increased from a baseline of 220ms to an average of 1.4s. Our Grafana monitoring shows this is causing our system to fail its target of 8,000 TPS, dropping to approximately 3,500 TPS and triggering a timeout-related error rate of 4.1% (HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout).\n\nThis performance is currently outside the acceptable parameters required for a successful audit and jeopardizes我们的RBI compliance posture. Our engineering team has logged this issue under JIRA PAY-7385. The preliminary root cause analysis points to a database I/O contention issue within the new core banking system, which seems to be exacerbated when real-time payment processing runs concurrently with the new settlement reconciliation module.\n\nWe are actively profiling the database and optimizing a set of write-intensive queries. However, to ensure we do not derail the audit timeline (Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25), we request a technical sync with your team. We would like to present our detailed findings, including Kibana log excerpts and a mitigation plan.

The model is generating an excessive number of false positives, leading to a significant impact on legitimate transaction success rates.\n\nBuilding on the collaborative spirit from our last exchange (email 6be42d345f2a4011), I need to escalate this matter for your immediate attention. \n\n**Technical Details & Business Impact:**\n\n*   **Metric Spike:** Our Grafana dashboards show the false positive rate has surged from a stable baseline of ~0.15% to an alarming 3.8% over the past 24 hours. \n*   **Transaction Impact:** This is causing approximately 1.2% of legitimate UPI transactions to be incorrectly declined post-authentication but pre-authorization. This primarily affects transactions above ₹5,000 from Tier-2 cities, a key growth segment.\n*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Our internal analysis via Kibana logs, tracked under JIRA PAY-1329, points towards the new geo-velocity and transaction frequency rules being overly aggressive. The system is flagging valid, sequential purchases as suspicious activity.\n*   **System Context:** This issue directly impacts the stability of our UPI gateway, a core component under review for the Data Localization audit (Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25). Maintaining system predictability is paramount for our compliance posture.\n\nThis level of transaction failure is not sustainable and poses a direct risk to merchant confidence and revenue.\n\n**Proposed Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Juspay (In Progress):** Our engineering team is preparing to roll back to the previous, stable fraud model version in our pre-production environment to validate a fix. \n2.  **NPCI (Request):** We request your team to urgently review the model's scoring logic for the flagged transaction sets. We can provide the anonymized transaction IDs that were incorrectly flagged. We believe a joint review of the model's feature weights is necessary.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nI am proposing an urgent call for 11:00 AM tomorrow to walk through the logs and align on a remediation plan.

This issue is isolated to customer profiles flagged by our real-time risk assessment engine. Our Grafana dashboards show that p99 latency for these specific API calls is spiking to over 2.2s before timing out, while baseline KYC calls for standard-risk profiles remain healthy at ~180ms.\n\nOur investigation, detailed in JIRA PAY-3684, points to an issue with how our requests are being processed by the NPCI gateway. Kibana logs show a high incidence of `503 Service Unavailable` responses specifically for OAuth 2.0 authenticated requests directed at the `/v2/kyc/enhanced-verify` endpoint from our primary Mumbai-based Kubernetes cluster. The initial network path analysis from `file#3853b6aba7484ef6` has been superseded by deeper checks discussed in `email#75c9d9c1dd104b7f`, which have ruled out internal network configuration or firewall issues on our side.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, this failure prevents the creation of a complete, immutable audit log for high-risk customer onboarding within our India-resident data stores. This is a direct contravention of the RBI's data localization mandate, and it will be a major finding if not rectified before the audit begins.\n\nWe require the NPCI team's immediate assistance to:\n1.  Analyze the ingress logs for the `/v2/kyc/enhanced-verify` endpoint to identify why requests from our production IP range are being throttled or rejected.\n2.  Confirm if any specific WAF rules or rate-limiting policies are being applied to this high-risk verification flow that differ from the standard KYC API.\n\nWe need to demonstrate a clear path to resolution by EOD tomorrow to keep the audit preparations on schedule.

Previous Slack threads highlighted a potential gap in how we prove data residency for enriched metadata during the settlement process. This call is to finalize our technical solution and documentation strategy before the mock audit next Tuesday.\n\nAnjali's team has confirmed that while core transaction data is secure in our Mumbai DC, metadata enriched with external FX rates gets temporarily stored in a Redis cache that isn't explicitly covered in our current data residency diagrams on Confluence. A query Rohan ran on the Euler ledger logs confirms this affects about 5% of non-INR settlements, making it a P1 audit risk. The main point of discussion is whether to attempt a risky pre-audit refactor or to justify the current architecture with robust proof of data lifecycle management.\n\nAfter reviewing the risks, we've decided against re-architecting before the audit. The path forward is to enhance monitoring and documentation. **Action Items:** \n1) **Anjali Gupta** to build and deploy a verification script that logs the purge status of the Redis FX cache every 30 minutes. This log will serve as our primary evidence of transience. **ETA: Friday EOD.**\n2) **Rohan Desai** to update the Confluence data flow diagram (under 'Multi-Currency Settlement Flow') to explicitly include this transient cache, its data lifecycle, and a link to the Kibana dashboard showing the new verification logs. **ETA: Tuesday COB.**\n3) **Priya Nair** to collate these new artifacts for the final evidence package for PAY-5368, which will close this specific audit query.

The existing process, which involves a cron job querying our forex partner's API every 15 minutes, introduces a settlement latency of up to T+900 seconds and a potential data residency gap. This plan outlines the migration to a real-time webhook-based system. The `forex-settlement-service` will expose a new secured endpoint, `/v1/settlement/confirm`, which our forex provider will call immediately upon successful currency conversion, ensuring event data is captured within our India-based infrastructure instantaneously.","The updated `forex-settlement-service`, built on the Akka framework, will ingest these webhook calls and publish settlement events to a dedicated Kafka topic: `upi_international_settlements_v2`. This decouples the confirmation event from the final database write, targeting a P99 latency for settlement acknowledgement under 150ms. A new failure code, `FX_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT` (Code: 85), will be triggered in our Grafana monitoring dashboard if a callback is not received within 30 seconds of the initial transaction authorization. All raw webhook payloads will be logged directly to our append-only audit table within the primary PostgreSQL cluster (Mumbai DC), with replication to the Cassandra cluster in the Chennai DR site, guaranteeing a complete and immutable audit trail for NPCI review.","Actionable next steps require the Core-Payments engineering team to deploy the new `/v1/settlement/confirm` endpoint to the staging environment by end-of-sprint. The integration team must then coordinate with the forex vendor to reconfigure their system to push to this webhook for a pre-defined set of test MIDs (Merchant IDs). I will create a child JIRA ticket under PAY-9516 to track this vendor-side configuration change.

A static rule designed to route specific MasterCard BIN ranges (54xxxx) to our primary domestic acquirer (ICICI Payseal) failed to exclude a new series of commercial cards issued from Singapore. This resulted in approximately 850 transactions over a 72-hour period being incorrectly forwarded to a domestic-only endpoint. The ICICI gateway subsequently rejected these transactions with error code '57: Transaction Not Permitted to Cardholder', but not before transiently logging partial PAN and expiry data in our Mumbai data center, which is not certified for storing international payment data under the NPCI data localization mandate.","Analysis of Kibana logs (index: `payment-processor-prod-*`) confirms that the `routing.decision.service` incorrectly applied the 'domestic_preferred' tag to transactions where the card's BIN country code ('SG') mismatched the transaction's IP geolocation ('SG'). The root cause is an overly broad regex in the rule (`^54[0-9]{4}$`) which lacked the necessary negative lookahead for the newly identified international BIN sub-range. This configuration flaw directly contravenes section 4.2 of the NPCI Data Localization Audit framework, which requires explicit and verifiable logic to segregate domestic and international transaction data flows prior to any processing.","Immediate remediation involves a hotfix deployment of an updated `bin_routing_rules.v1.6.yaml`. This patch introduces a more specific regex that excludes the problematic Singaporean BINs and correctly defaults them to our Stripe International gateway. The SRE team will push this configuration change via the established CI/CD pipeline, with an estimated deployment time of 15 minutes. As a preventative measure tracked under PAY-6326, we will accelerate the integration of an external BIN database API (e.g., Binable) into the pre-routing stage. This will replace our static rule file with a dynamic lookup, ensuring our routing logic adapts to new card issuances without manual intervention and providing a clear audit trail for compliance verification."],"owner":"Priya Nair","ownerEmail":"priya.nair@juspay.in","photoLink":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/photo2","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.nair@juspay.in","tech-leads@juspay.in","product-team@juspay.in","compliance@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"application/json","createdAt":1757910600000,"updatedAt":1757910600000}},

Our automated settlement system flagged a deficit of INR 4,215.50 between our UPI gateway's transaction totals and the final credited amount specified in the settlement file (Batch ID: NPCI-SETL-20240611-B471).\n\nThe discrepancy appears to be linked to 17 specific transactions. These transactions are marked as 'SUCCESS' in our system logs, having received a `00` response code via the `/upi/v2/transaction/status` API endpoint. However, they are absent from the corresponding settlement file provided by NPCI. This issue is being tracked under JIRA PAY-9292.\n\nAs per our analysis, which builds on the data flow architecture outlined in file 5cb98f1e474a44d5, the Retriever Reference Numbers (RRNs) for these transactions were successfully captured and forwarded. Our Kibana logs show no anomalies or timeouts from our side during the transaction lifecycle. The integrity of this end-to-end process is a critical control for the audit under Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25.\n\nTo resolve this and complete our audit evidence pack, we require the following from your team:\n\n1.  An investigation into the 17 RRNs listed in JIRA PAY-9292.\n2.  Confirmation of their final settlement status from your system of record.\n3.  An explanation for their omission from the settlement file for June 10th, and clarification on when we can expect these funds to be settled.\n\nWe must ensure our reconciliation controls are robust and auditable.

Between 16:10 and 16:45 IST yesterday, p99 latency for the risk evaluation endpoint (`/v1/risk/evaluate`) escalated from a baseline of 85ms to a peak of 1.2s. This coincided with a surge in transaction processing to ~60k TPS.\n\nOur SRE team has correlated this with a rogue analytics job that was consuming excessive CPU, leading to throttling of the risk engine's pods. Kibana logs from that period show a significant number of `503 Service Unavailable` errors being returned to our internal UPI gateway before requests could be processed. This resulted in a temporary 0.4% increase in transaction timeouts.\n\nIn response to your query regarding data residency, we have audited the logs for the entire incident window. All transaction data, including payment instrument details and user metadata, was processed and stored exclusively within our primary AWS ap-south-1 (Mumbai) region, in full compliance with RBI's data localization mandate. The audit trail referenced in `file#5cb98f1e474a44d5` confirms no cross-border data transit occurred.\n\nAction items from our side:\n1.  The rogue analytics job has been terminated, and stricter resource quotas have been applied to its namespace to prevent recurrence.\n2.  We have triggered an immediate scale-up of the risk engine's pod count by 20% to handle higher peak loads.\n3.

Building on the initial observations in email 93da2ea184fd4bff, we have now confirmed a systemic failure in the OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow, leading to significant API timeouts.\n\nOur Grafana monitoring dashboards for the UPI gateway show a sharp increase in P99 latency for payment initiation API calls, spiking to over 2100ms from a baseline of ~175ms. This correlates with a 4.8% transaction failure rate, presenting as HTTP 401 Unauthorized errors. Our engineering team has traced this back to intermittent timeouts and non-200 responses from your `/oauth/token` endpoint when our system attempts a `refresh_token` grant. The failures appear to be concentrated during peak load, between 14:00 and 16:30 IST.\n\nKibana logs from our API gateway confirm that our requests are correctly formatted, but the token refresh endpoint fails to respond within our 1500ms timeout threshold. This invalidates the JWT access token, causing subsequent API calls to fail authorization. This issue is being tracked internally under JIRA ticket PAY-6747.\n\nThis instability is a major blocker for our audit preparations. We are unable to complete the data validation and integrity checks required by the audit framework (as detailed in file#5cb98f1e474a44d5) with the current API performance. This puts the entire audit timeline at significant risk.\n\nWe require your immediate action on the following:\n1.

We believe in maintaining full transparency on our operational readiness.\n\nOver the last 72 hours, we observed a significant spike in the false positive rate generated by our primary ML-based fraud detection model. The rate escalated from our standard baseline of 0.6% to a peak of 2.1%, which triggered internal alerts from our Grafana monitoring dashboard. Our analysis indicates that this has resulted in approximately 0.2% of legitimate UPI transactions being incorrectly flagged with an internal 'High-Risk' score, leading to unnecessary challenges or declines.\n\nOur engineering and data science teams are investigating this under JIRA ticket PAY-1488. The preliminary root cause analysis points towards a recent model update (v3.2) deployed last Monday. This version included more stringent rules for identifying potential data exfiltration attempts to enhance our compliance with RBI's data storage mandates. Unfortunately, it seems the model's new feature weighting for transaction velocity and cross-border API call metadata is overly sensitive, misinterpreting legitimate, high-frequency merchant settlement patterns as anomalous behavior.\n\nTo be clear, this issue does not represent a breach of data localization. All transaction data, including the flagged records, remains securely stored within our India-based Kubernetes clusters, and our audit logs confirm no data has left the designated boundaries. The primary impact is operational, creating analytical noise and a minor degradation in user experience for a small cohort of merchants.\n\nWe have initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation:** The model has been rolled back to the previous stable version (v3.1) in production as of 11:00 AM IST today. Our transaction success rate has already returned to the normal 99.85% baseline.\n\n2.  **Model Retraining:** The data science team is currently retraining v3.2 with an augmented dataset that includes the transaction patterns that generated the false positives. This will improve its predictive accuracy without compromising its sensitivity to genuine threats.\n\n3.  **Documentation Update:** We are preparing a detailed incident report which will be appended to our audit evidence package. This report will include performance metrics pre- and post-incident and a summary of the corrective actions taken, referencing the initial model parameters outlined in `file 5cb98f1e474a44d5`.\n\nWe are confident that these measures have resolved the immediate issue and will strengthen our fraud detection framework for the audit.

This review builds on the concerns raised in the previous thread (ref: email a4e135c889004179) regarding RBI's data localization mandates.\n\nOur primary point of investigation is the data flow for transactions involving foreign currencies (e.g., USD, AED, SGD) through our settlement systems. While our core UPI gateway and transaction processing services are fully localized, the multi-currency settlement flow introduces external dependencies that require explicit validation.\n\n**Technical Details & Findings:**\n\n1.  **System Architecture:** The current process involves our `settlement-reconciliation-service` calling an external `forex-conversion-api` to fetch real-time exchange rates. While the final settlement data is stored in our local data centers, the transient data packets exchanged during the rate lookup are not being explicitly logged with geographical markers. This presents a potential gap for the audit.\n\n2.  **Audit Logs:** Our Kibana logs for the settlement service currently lack the granularity to prove that no payment data is processed or stored outside India during the forex conversion leg. The logs capture the transaction initiation and the final INR settlement, but the intermediate conversion step is a black box from a localization audit perspective. This is the central issue we're tracking in JIRA PAY-8409.\n\n3.  **Performance Metrics:** The `forex-conversion-api` is performing within SLAs, with a p99 latency of 210ms. The concern is not performance, but the compliance of the data-in-motion during these API calls.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **For NPCI:** Could you please review the proposed logging enhancement detailed in `file#5cb98f1e474a44d5`? We plan to augment our audit logs to include the source IP and geo-tags for every external API response in the settlement chain. We need your confirmation on whether this level of detail would suffice for the upcoming audit.\n\n2.  **For Juspay Engineering:** We require a definitive data flow diagram for the end-to-end multi-currency settlement lifecycle. This must map all data ingress/egress points and external system interactions. The initial draft should be ready for review by next Wednesday.\n\nOur objective is to finalize the required changes and deploy the enhanced logging to our staging environment within the next two sprint cycles.

This analysis builds on the initial thread in email c9e288ba22064220.\n\nTechnically, we observed the p99 latency for our internal risk-scoring API endpoint (`/v2/risk/evaluate`) spiking from a baseline of 250ms to over 1.8s during peak transaction loads (~80K TPS). Our Grafana monitoring shows this correlates directly with increased I/O wait times on our primary Kubernetes cluster handling the database writes for data localization. It looks like the synchronous write-acknowledgment from the India-domiciled RDS instance is the primary bottleneck, impacting the entire transaction flow before a response is sent back to the UPI gateway.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective for Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25, this synchronous replication delay poses a risk to satisfying the real-time data residency requirements outlined in RBI guidelines. While all data is stored locally, the processing delay could be interpreted as a failure to complete the transaction end-to-end within the designated infrastructure in a timely manner.\n\nOur engineering team is implementing two immediate measures:\n1.  **Short-term:** Offloading certain non-critical data enrichment calls to an asynchronous queue to reduce the synchronous payload size. This is a temporary fix to bring latency back within our 300ms SLA.\n2.  **Long-term:** Re-architecting the replication logic to use a publish/subscribe model with a robust reconciliation framework, ensuring data integrity without impacting the critical path of the transaction. The proposed architecture is detailed in file#5cb98f1e474a44d5.\n\nTo ensure our remediation aligns with your audit requirements, could you provide clarification on the evidential requirements for data flow timeliness?

This throttling is causing a significant increase in `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors, leading to a transaction failure rate spike from a baseline of 0.2% to 2.3% during peak hours (11:00 AM - 2:00 PM IST).\n\nTechnical Details:\n•   Impacted Endpoint: `/v2/upi/payment/request`\n•   Error Code: `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`\n•   Performance Impact: P99 latency has increased to 1.8s from our standard 250ms.\n•   Log Evidence: Kibana queries show a direct correlation between traffic exceeding ~4,500 TPS and the onset of `429` responses from the NPCI gateway. This is being tracked internally under JIRA PAY-3821.\n\nThis bottleneck prevents us from conducting the mandatory full-scale load tests on our localized data centers, a key requirement outlined in the audit checklist (ref: file#5cb98f1e474a44d5). We cannot validate our system's resilience or compliance with RBI guidelines without simulating expected peak volumes.\n\nOur internal investigation confirms the issue is external. Our Kubernetes pods for the UPI gateway are scaling as expected, and the OAuth 2.0 JWT token refresh flow via the `/oauth/token` endpoint is operating within normal parameters with no errors. The bottleneck is definitively at the transaction processing layer on your side.\n\nAction Required:\n1.  We request an immediate investigation into the rate-limiting profile applied to our client ID (`JUSPAY_PROD_9A8B7C`).\n2.  We require a temporary but urgent increase of our TPS limit to a minimum of 10,000 TPS for the next 15 days to complete our pre-audit stress testing.\n3.  Please provide documentation detailing our current limits, burst capacity allowance, and the standard procedure for requesting permanent adjustments.\n\nOur engineering lead, Aditya Singh, is on standby to provide logs, traces, or join a technical call with your team to resolve this. Timely resolution is critical to meet the audit deadlines for Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757916360000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["upi.operations@npci.org.in","technical.support@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This issue is directly impacting our readiness for the NPCI Data Localization Audit (Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25).\n\nOur monitoring systems have flagged a severe degradation in API performance during pre-audit stress testing. Specifically:\n\n- **Latency:** The p99 latency for our UPI gateway calls to your primary transaction endpoint has spiked from a baseline of ~180ms to sustained periods over 1.8 seconds. Our Grafana dashboards indicate this delay originates outside our network perimeter.\n- **Error Rate:** We've observed a corresponding increase in our transaction failure rate from <0.2% to approximately 1.7%, predominantly with NPCI response code 'U30' (Transaction timeout). This occurs when we approach test volumes of 40-45k TPS.\n- **System Analysis:** A review of our Kibana logs shows that our internal service latencies, including the OAuth 2.0 token generation and request signing, remain nominal at sub-40ms. The performance issue seems to be isolated to the response times from your newly migrated CBS infrastructure.\n\nThis level of performance does not meet the operational stability criteria required for the audit, as outlined in the RBI guidelines we previously reviewed (referenced in file#5cb98f1e474a44d5). This issue is being tracked with high priority under our internal ticket, JIRA PAY-5329.\n\nTo resolve this ahead of the audit deadline, we request your immediate assistance. Could your core systems team investigate potential resource contention or configuration drift within the new CBS environment that could be affecting transaction processing times under load? \n\nWe propose a joint technical debugging session between your engineering team and our SRE lead, Aditya Singh, to perform an end-to-end trace analysis.

As documented in JIRA PAY-4969, we are observing a 14.2% failure rate for automated KYC verification, specifically for users flagged by our internal risk engine.\n\nBuilding on the initial findings from email 00c784c1a5504424, a deeper dive into the Kibana logs (index: `kyc-service-prod-*`) reveals that our `v3/customer/verify-document` API endpoint is consistently returning an HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout error. This occurs when the service attempts to process scanned Aadhaar cards and PAN cards with lower DPI resolutions, a characteristic common to the documents uploaded by this user segment. The average response time for these failed requests is spiking to 2.8s before timing out, well above our 800ms p95 threshold for the KYC service.\n\nThe root cause does not appear to be with the NPCI-facing integration itself but rather with our upstream document processing service. It seems the OCR data extraction layer, which runs in a dedicated Kubernetes pod, is hitting CPU and memory limits when handling these specific image types. The Grafana dashboard for this service confirms sustained CPU throttling at 90% during these processing attempts.\n\nThis is a critical compliance gap for Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25. Failure to automatically process and store KYC data for all customer segments within India-based data centers violates the data residency mandate outlined in RBI's 2018 circular, which will be a primary focus of the upcoming NPCI audit.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Aditya Singh:** Please lead the engineering review of the OCR service. We need to determine if the issue can be resolved through resource allocation adjustments or if an optimization of the image processing library is required. Please provide an initial assessment by EOD tomorrow.\n2.  **Infra Team:** Immediately review the resource quotas for the `kyc-document-processor` deployment. Let's evaluate a temporary vertical scaling of the pods as an interim containment measure.\n3.  **Myself (Priya Nair):** I will update the risk register with this finding and prepare a formal notification for the audit committee, outlining our mitigation strategy based on your findings.\n\nOur deadline for achieving full compliance for this audit is approaching.

We've identified 47 UPI transactions, totaling INR 87,450.00, which received a synchronous 'SUCCESS' confirmation from the UPI gateway but were subsequently missing from the final settlement file (Batch ID: NPCI_SETL_20241028_003). This is a continuation of the issue first raised in email a43377d89cff43ec.\n\nOur internal analysis confirms that our systems are functioning correctly. Kibana logs show that for each of these transactions, our UPI gateway received a valid success response. However, our post-facto reconciliation jobs, which poll your `/getTxnStatus` endpoint for verification, are receiving inconsistent states. For approximately 60% of the affected `JuspayTxnId`s, the API returns `TXN_PENDING`, while the remaining 40% are returning a `U30` (Transaction not found) error code. A full list of `NPCI_Ref_IDs` is attached in file `5cb98f1e474a44d5` for your reference.\n\nThis discrepancy poses a significant compliance risk for our upcoming NPCI Data Localization audit (Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25). As per RBI guidelines, we must be able to prove the definitive final state and storage location for every transaction processed.

P99 latency on the `/v2/upi/payment` endpoint is hitting ~2.2s, up from our baseline of 280ms. The error rate for `401 Unauthorized` has jumped from <0.1% to 3.8% in the last 6 hours. The issue is being tracked under JIRA PAY-1402.\n\nBuilding on the initial analysis from Aditya in email a2c9e1bba83a4237, the problem seems to be intermittent failures in the OAuth 2.0 refresh token grant flow. When our service attempts to exchange a refresh token for a new JWT access token, the NPCI auth endpoint is occasionally timing out or returning a non-200 status without a clear error body. This causes our services to attempt subsequent API calls with expired JWTs, resulting in the 401s. Standard retry logic isn't mitigating this, which suggests it's not a simple transient network issue.\n\nMy hypothesis is that we might be hitting an undocumented rate limit on the token refresh endpoint, or there's been a subtle change on the NPCI side that our client isn't handling gracefully. I've reviewed the logs in Kibana, but we lack the full request/response payload visibility during the failure to confirm.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **Aditya:** Can your team prioritize deploying enhanced logging for the entire token exchange process? We need the exact request headers and body sent to NPCI and the raw response received during these failures. Please link the PR to PAY-1402.\n2.  **SRE:** Please configure a specific alert in our alert management system for a >1% rate of `401` errors on the NPCI API cluster, with a 5-minute evaluation period.\n3.  **Anjali (self-assigned):** I will draft a formal communication to our NPCI technical contact with specific transaction IDs and timestamps from the last 12 hours.

The issue was traced back to an OAuth 2.0 token refresh failure originating from a misconfiguration in our token caching layer.\n\nHere is a summary of the incident and our response:\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n*   **Root Cause:** A recent deployment introduced an incorrect TTL (Time to Live) setting in our Redis cache cluster responsible for managing JWT tokens for the NPCI gateway. This caused our system to attempt using expired tokens for authentication instead of initiating the refresh flow.\n*   **Impact:** Between 14:30 and 15:15 IST, our Grafana monitoring showed a spike in HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout errors, peaking at approximately 2.8%. This primarily affected the `/upi/v2.0/req-pay` endpoint, where p99 latency increased from a baseline of 190ms to over 2100ms. Log analysis in Kibana confirmed a surge of `INVALID_TOKEN` responses from the NPCI API.\n*   **Scope:** The failure impacted roughly 1.5% of our total transaction volume during that window, a critical deviation from our 99.95% uptime SLA.\n\n**Resolution & Mitigation:**\n*   **Immediate Action:** The SRE team executed a rollback of the problematic Kubernetes deployment at 15:20 IST. System performance returned to nominal levels immediately, with error rates now stable below 0.1%.\n*   **JIRA Tracking:** All technical details, logs, and resolution steps have been documented in JIRA PAY-8364, which is now marked as Resolved.\n*   **Preventative Measures:** We are implementing stricter validation checks within our CI/CD pipeline to automatically reject deployments with anomalous token TTL configurations. Additionally, we are enhancing our alerting to trigger on token expiry metrics, not just API error rates.\n\nThis incident is being treated with high priority, especially in the context of our ongoing NPCI Data Localization Audit readiness for Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25.

These are not random timeouts; our Kibana logs consistently show our service receiving an HTTP `422 Unprocessable Entity` response with the error code `ERR_INVALID_DATA_FORMAT` specifically for this user cohort.\n\nThis creates a severe compliance gap. The failure to automate KYC for this segment forces a manual fallback, which does not meet the stringent data processing and storage requirements outlined in RBI's circular on data localization.

While these logs are stored within our Mumbai-based DC and are subject to a 60-minute rotation policy, the capture of unmasked PAN data constitutes a PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 violation.\n\nThe responsible configuration was immediately rolled back, and we have raised JIRA PAY-4867 to track a full root cause analysis and implement stricter controls within our CI/CD pipeline to prevent recurrence. All affected logs have been securely purged, and we have validated that no sensitive data persists.\n\nAs we prepare our formal incident report for the PCI QSA, we must also ensure our documentation satisfies NPCI's requirements for the data localization audit.

The core challenge, expanding on the points raised in email bf9fd6f0c70542ad, is how we integrate a third-party Forex API for real-time currency conversion while guaranteeing all transaction processing and data storage remains within India's sovereign boundaries.\n\nCurrently, our `settlement-reconciliation-engine` processes INR-only batches on a T+1 cycle efficiently. The proposal is to modify our `settlement-service` to handle dynamic conversions for currencies like USD and EUR. My primary concern is the data flow: if we make an external API call to a Forex provider, we must ensure that no sensitive payment data (e.g., card hash, user identifiers) is part of that API request payload. The request should only contain non-sensitive data like currency pair and amount.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, all resultant data—including the original currency amount, the applied FX rate, the final INR settlement value, and the timestamp—must be immediately persisted in our `aurora-prod-settlements` DB cluster in the Mumbai region before being passed to any other internal service. This is non-negotiable for the upcoming NPCI audit.\n\nI have documented the high-level business case in file#5cb98f1e474a44d5 and created a JIRA task to track the technical discovery: PAY-4323.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Priya (Engineering):** Could your team please conduct a technical feasibility study? We need to understand the performance implications of introducing real-time API calls into our batch settlement process. Can our current Kubernetes pod autoscaling configuration handle the potential latency spikes during peak settlement hours?\n\n2.  **Aditya (Architecture/Compliance):** We need a formal risk assessment on this proposed architecture against RBI's circular.

More critically, it compromises our declaration for the RBI's data localization mandate, as these logs are not exclusively stored within India-based data centers.\n*   **Reference:** This finding directly contradicts the data flow architecture outlined in my previous email (ref: email#ab40558cc9d443e2) and the evidence file `5cb98f1e474a44d5`.\n\nThis issue has been logged under JIRA ticket **PAY-9447**.\n\n**Action Items & Owners:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Containment (InfoSec - by EOD):** We need an emergency filter deployed in the logging pipeline (Logstash/Fluentd) to scrub the `card.pan_fragment` field *before* it is indexed in Elasticsearch. This will halt further data exposure.\n2.  **Root Cause Remediation (Engineering - ETA required):** The engineering team responsible for the UPI gateway needs to deploy a hotfix that removes this sensitive data from the logging statement within the service's exception handling logic.\n3.  **Compliance Documentation (Priya Nair):** I will update the risk register and prepare the official incident report for the audit trail. All remediation evidence must be attached to PAY-9447.\n\nWe need to treat this with the highest priority to ensure we are prepared for the formal NPCI audit.

This is a critical issue for our NPCI Data Localization Audit Readiness project (Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25).\n\n**Technical Analysis & Impact:**\n\nBetween 14:30 and 15:15 IST yesterday, our primary UPI gateway experienced significant degradation. \n\n*   **Performance Metrics:** Our Grafana dashboards showed p99 latency for the `/v2/payments/initiate` endpoint spiking from a baseline of 180ms to over 2200ms. \n*   **Error Logs:** Kibana log analysis revealed a sharp increase in `401 Unauthorized` responses from the NPCI auth endpoint. This cascaded into `504 Gateway Timeout` errors within our service mesh as requests from our Kubernetes pods began to queue and fail.\n*   **Business Impact:** This resulted in a transaction failure rate of approximately 4.5% during the incident window, a significant deviation from our standard 0.2% rate. We are tracking the full impact under our internal JIRA ticket PAY-9026.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this instability is a major concern. The audit framework outlined in file#5cb98f1e474a44d5 explicitly requires us to demonstrate robust and resilient authentication controls as per RBI guidelines. A recurring failure in the token management lifecycle presents a material risk to our audit readiness.\n\n**Mitigation and Next Steps:**\n\nOur SRE team has deployed a temporary fix by increasing the JWT token cache TTL in our Redis layer and implementing a more aggressive retry mechanism with exponential backoff on our client. While this has stabilized latency and brought the error rate back to nominal levels, it is not a sustainable solution and introduces its own latency risks.\n\nThe preliminary analysis we shared in email#455fb4e59f794e78 did not indicate any misconfiguration on our side. We request your immediate assistance in investigating your OAuth service logs for our client ID during the incident period. We suspect there may be unannounced rate-limiting or a potential issue on your token issuance infrastructure that is triggered under high-concurrency scenarios.\n\nCould we schedule a joint technical call with your API engineering team before this Friday to resolve this permanently? Ensuring a stable authentication flow is paramount for passing the upcoming audit.\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya Nair\nCompliance Specialist\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757920920000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["npci.compliance@npci.org.in","api.support@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

However, these transactions were included as successful in the settlement file `NPCI-SETL-JUSPAY-20241108-R1.csv`.\n\nOur Kibana logs confirm that for these transactions, our system initiated a transaction status query via the `/v2/transaction/status` endpoint, which subsequently returned a `status: 'PENDING'` or timed out. Our system correctly marked these as failed internally and initiated reversals where applicable. The inclusion of these transactions in the final settlement file from your end suggests a state mismatch between our respective systems.\n\nThis issue has been formally logged under JIRA ticket PAY-3805 for internal tracking and remediation.\n\nA detailed list of the discrepant `NPCI_TXN_ID`s is attached, building upon the initial list shared in file#5cb98f1e474a44d5.\n\nCould your technical team please:\n1.

The discrepancy in yesterday's T+1 settlement batch amounts to ₹4,72,105 across 1,124 transactions. This is now tracked under JIRA PAY-7204.\n\nOur investigation points to an issue during the final reconciliation handshake. A review of our Kibana logs shows that our settlement processor successfully marked all 1,124 transactions as `SUCCESS` post-authorization, with valid NPCI transaction IDs logged. However, when our system queries NPCI's reconciliation endpoint for final batch confirmation, we are seeing a spike in `504 Gateway Timeout` errors.\n\nThe Grafana dashboard for our NPCI integration shows that p99 latency for calls to this specific endpoint rose to 2.2s between 02:15 and 02:45 AM IST, which directly coincides with our settlement window. This is significantly above our configured 800ms timeout threshold, causing our system to fail the reconciliation check for these transactions despite them being successful on the UPI network. The raw settlement file (file#5cb98f1e474a44d5) you shared confirms these transactions were indeed settled to the respective accounts.\n\nThis inconsistency presents a significant challenge for our NPCI Data Localization Audit readiness (Work ID 69531c7e-068c-4371-9bc3-b0149706dc25), as demonstrating end-to-end data integrity is a critical requirement.

We need to understand if there was any service degradation or resource contention on your end that could explain the elevated latency.\n2.  **Juspay Team:** Our SREs are already working on increasing the client-side timeout for this specific API call and implementing a more resilient retry mechanism with exponential backoff to better handle such transient latency spikes.\n\nWe need to ensure a robust and reliable reconciliation process.

Our primary objective remains full adherence to RBI's data localization directives while enhancing our settlement capabilities.\n\nHere is a summary of our implementation and its compliance posture:\n\n1.  **Data Segregation and Localization:** All payment transaction data, including data required for multi-currency settlement, is stored and processed exclusively on our infrastructure within India (our primary DC is in Mumbai, DR in Chennai). This architecture is a core design principle and has been verified to prevent any cross-border data flow for payment system data.\n\n2.  **Multi-Currency Processing Flow:**\n    *   The enhancement introduces a step to fetch forex rates for non-INR transactions. This is handled by an internal, isolated 'Forex Service' that calls a certified third-party API. \n    *   Crucially, the API request to this external service contains *only* the currency pair (e.g., 'USD-INR') and a transaction timestamp. No PII, cardholder data, or any other sensitive payment information as defined by RBI guidelines is transmitted. This is enforced via a strict outbound data filter.\n    *   The settlement amount is calculated within our secure environment, and the resulting INR value is stored in our PostgreSQL settlement database. The schema has been updated to include `original_currency`, `fx_rate`, and `source_amount` fields. All data at rest is encrypted using AES-256.\n\n3.  **Audit Trail and Monitoring:**\n    *   Every stage of this process, from the initial transaction to the final settlement instruction, is logged in our centralized Kibana cluster. This includes the anonymized forex rate API call and the internal calculation.\n    *   Our Grafana dashboards are configured with alerts to trigger if any outbound traffic from the settlement service's Kubernetes pods deviates from the whitelisted Forex Service endpoint, ensuring immediate detection of potential compliance breaches.\n\n4.  **Performance Impact:** Staging environment tests on the new flow, tracked under JIRA PAY-9405, indicate an average latency increase of only 85ms for settlement batch processing, which is well within our performance targets and does not impact our T+1 settlement SLA.\n\nWe believe this approach effectively addresses the multi-currency requirement without compromising the principles of data localization. We have updated the data flow diagram previously shared as file#5cb98f1e474a44d5 and would appreciate your review of the proposed additions to the settlement file format detailed within.\n\nWe are prepared to conduct a live demonstration of this E2E flow in our sandboxed environment at your convenience. Please let us know a suitable time for a brief technical walkthrough next week.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPriya Nair\nCompliance Specialist\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757922360000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["audit.team@npci.org.in","ravi.sharma@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"]}},

Our pre-audit checks have confirmed a misconfiguration in the payment-gateway's routing rules for specific international BINs. This led to a small but critical percentage of transactions (~0.5% over 48 hours) being processed via a pipeline that does not enforce strict in-country data residency, which is a direct violation of the upcoming NPCI localization mandate.\n\nThe Grafana dashboard for 'Cross-Border-Flows' clearly shows the anomaly, and we've traced it to a legacy routing rule that was not deprecated post the 'Project-Odyssey' migration. The immediate priority is to close this gap before the audit window opens. We need to align on both the immediate hotfix and the long-term preventative measures to ensure this class of error is eliminated from our deployment cycle.\n\nBased on our earlier Slack discussion, here is the proposed plan for sign-off in this meeting:\n\n**Decisions & Actions:**\n- **Immediate Fix:** Approve PR #8912 for immediate deployment. This PR disables the legacy routing rule entirely. We need Ravi to confirm deployment readiness and rollback strategy.\n- **Data Remediation:** Anjali's team will run a BigQuery script to identify all affected transaction_ids. The plan is to redact any non-compliant PII data that was logged outside the designated India region data store.

The audit identified that the `pre_auth_raw_stream` Kafka topic, managed by our `presto-router` service, is momentarily holding unmasked Primary Account Numbers (PANs) before they are ingested by the `HyperVault` tokenization engine. While the data residence time is under 50ms, this constitutes a violation of PCI DSS v4.0 Requirement 3.4, which mandates PANs be rendered unreadable anywhere they are stored. The current Log4j2 configuration is logging the full payload on serialization failure events, which are then shipped via a Fluentd sidecar to a non-production ELK stack hosted outside the India (Mumbai) region, creating a data localization breach.","The immediate remediation involves modifying the `presto-router`'s serialization logic to enforce PAN masking at the application layer before the message is published to Kafka. A new utility class, `PanMasker`, will be introduced, applying the standard `6x...4x` format (e.g., `454545XXXXXX4545`). This will be enforced on the `payment_details.card_number` field within the JSON payload. Simultaneously, the Fluentd filter configuration (`fluent.conf`) will be updated with a `record_transformer` rule to explicitly remove the `payment_details` object from any logs originating from the `presto-router` namespace destined for non-production environments. This provides a secondary control to prevent accidental data spillage.","The engineering team must deploy this patch to the staging environment (UAT-2) within the next 48 hours for verification. The success criteria will be zero instances of unmasked PANs in the `pre_auth_raw_stream` topic, confirmed using the Kafkacat tool to inspect live message payloads.

Grafana metrics show a direct correlation between the latency increase in our `/v2/upi/score` endpoint and a surge in Redis cache misses for our `user_profile_velocity` keys, which jumped from a baseline of <5% to over 40%. This degradation forced Sentinel's scoring pods to fall back to expensive ScyllaDB reads for feature computation, overwhelming the cluster I/O and causing a processing backlog. The elevated latency risks UPI transaction timeouts, potentially increasing our rate of `U30` (Transaction timed out at PSP) responses, a key metric for the NPCI audit.","The root cause has been isolated to the `allkeys-lru` eviction policy configured on the Redis instance backing Sentinel. During high-velocity transaction periods, this policy incorrectly evicts frequently used (but not most-recently-used) VPA profiles, leading to a read-after-write-after-eviction storm where the service must repeatedly re-fetch the same profile data from ScyllaDB. Kibana log queries from the Sentinel pods confirm this pattern, showing repeated, high-latency data fetches for identical VPA sets that were likely just evicted from the cache. This behavior creates a significant performance bottleneck that is not sustainable under projected load increases.","The immediate remediation plan is to modify the Redis configuration for this specific instance to use the `volatile-lfu` (Least Frequently Used) eviction policy. This change is better suited for our access patterns, as it prioritizes retaining frequently accessed user profiles over simply the most recent ones. This will be deployed via a rolling restart of the Sentinel service pods to avoid downtime. For a long-term solution, as tracked in PAY-5236, engineering will implement a tiered caching strategy using an in-memory Caffeine cache within the Sentinel service for 'hot' profiles (transacted in the last 5 minutes), reducing reliance on the shared Redis layer.

The findings below require our immediate attention to mitigate potential non-compliance risks.\n\nThis review builds upon the initial gap analysis from file fa5f856eed244c9c and is specific to the optimization requirements for Work ID 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7.\n\nKey Findings & Required Actions:\n\n1.  **Settlement Cycle Latency:** Our current T+2 settlement cycle for non-INR currency pairs (e.g., USD, AED) is a direct violation of the new mandate requiring a T+1 cycle. Our 'Orion' settlement engine's batch processing logic will need significant re-architecture to meet this. The Grafana dashboard for settlement performance already shows p99 batch completion times nearing 18 hours, which leaves no buffer for a T+1 window.\n\n2.  **API Authentication Vulnerability:** The `/settlements/v1/forex/batch` endpoint currently relies on a static, long-lived API key for authentication. This is explicitly flagged as a critical vulnerability in the NPCI audit checklist. We must prioritize migrating this endpoint to an OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow with JWT tokens that have a maximum expiry of 1 hour.\n\n3.  **Reconciliation Discrepancies:** Analysis of Kibana logs from our 'Recon-Prod' cluster over the last 30 days reveals a 1.3% error rate in automated reconciliation for multi-currency transactions, primarily due to `Error Code: 409-FX_RATE_MISMATCH`. This is well above the acceptable audit threshold of 0.2%. The root cause appears to be our Redis forex rate cache TTL, which is currently set to 10 minutes. This is too long given market volatility.\n\n4.  **Insufficient Audit Trails:** The audit logs generated for cross-border settlements are missing key data points required for regulatory reporting under RBI guidelines. We must add `remitter_pan`, `purpose_code`, and `forex_conversion_rate_id` to the event payload for every transaction logged in our immutable Splunk index.\n\nAction Items (as tracked in JIRA PAY-2078):\n\n*   **Aditya Singh:** Please lead the engineering effort to scope out the necessary changes for the T+1 settlement cycle and the OAuth 2.0 migration. I need a high-level technical approach and a resource estimate by EOD Friday, 14th June.\n*   **DevOps Team:** Please draft a plan to reduce the Redis forex rate cache TTL to 60 seconds and monitor the impact on our upstream forex provider API call volume. We need to ensure we don't hit their rate limits.\n*   **My action:** I will consolidate the required logging fields and share them as an addendum to PAY-2078 by tomorrow.\n\nLet's schedule a 30-minute sync for this Monday to review the proposed technical approach. The goal is to have all critical path development completed and deployed to the staging environment within the next three weeks.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead"],"timestamp":1757912460000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","devops-leads@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This requires our immediate attention, especially with the NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit for Work ID 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7 commencing next week.\n\n**Summary of Findings (JIRA: PAY-3507):**\n\n*   **Root Cause:** A flawed rule within our `payment-router-service` Kubernetes deployment is incorrectly identifying UPI International transactions (specifically from UAE and Singapore corridors) as domestic. The VPA pattern matching for these corridors is failing, defaulting them to the primary domestic acquiring flow.\n*   **Impact Analysis:** Over the last 72 hours, we've logged 1,482 failed transactions with an error code `U30 - Transaction Not Permitted`. This is happening because our domestic gateway endpoints are rejecting the requests, as the OAuth 2.0 flow fails due to unrecognized international partner JWT tokens. The total affected transaction value is approximately ₹3.1M.\n*   **Compliance Risk:** This is a significant finding. It directly contravenes RBI's FEMA guidelines on cross-border settlements and NPCI's own circular (NPCI/UPI/2023-24/021) on transaction processing integrity. This will undoubtedly be a critical failure point during the audit if not addressed immediately.\n*   **Monitoring Data:** The 'UPI Transaction Failures' Grafana dashboard shows a sustained 1.5% increase in the `U30` error rate since the last deployment on Tuesday. Normal baseline is <0.1% for this error type.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n\n1.  **Engineering (cc: Priya):** Please treat this as a P0 issue. We need a hotfix to correct the routing logic in the `payment-router-service`. The fix must be deployed to the staging environment by 6 PM today for immediate validation by the QA team.\n2.  **Operations (cc: Sandeep):** Please begin manual reconciliation of the 1,482 failed transactions.

A rule change deployed yesterday at 18:30 IST, intended for new Singapore corridor MCCs, contained an overly permissive regex. This caused it to incorrectly process transactions from our UAE corridor, leading to downstream failures.\n\n**Technical Impact:**\n*   **Error Spike:** Our Kibana logs show a significant increase in `U69 (Transaction Not Permitted)` and `U16 (Invalid Amount)` error codes from partner banks.\n*   **Metrics:** The issue affected approximately 1.8% of our international transaction volume, with failure rates peaking at 4.2% for the UAE-IN P2M flow. The \"UPI-CrossBorder-Errors\" Grafana dashboard shows p99 latency for these failed transactions hitting 1.8s, far above our 450ms SLA.\n*   **Root Cause:** The specific faulty regex is documented in the commit history linked in `file#fa5f856eed244c9c`.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\nThe SRE team has already reverted the change in the staging environment, and tests confirm the routing logic is now correct.

Building on Aditya's initial diagnosis in email 34d808dc3fb140d1, our Grafana dashboards confirm a direct correlation between token expiry and API timeouts.\n\nKibana logs from the `auth-service` Kubernetes pods are showing a pattern of `401 Unauthorized` errors when our system attempts to post to the NPCI UAT `/token` endpoint with an expired JWT. The subsequent token refresh attempt is then failing intermittently with an 'Invalid Grant' response, which suggests a potential logic error in our refresh token handling or a state mismatch. This is causing a cascading failure, resulting in `504 Gateway Timeout` errors for approximately 4.5% of calls to our internal `/api/v1/payment/initiate` endpoint. The p99 latency for these transactions has spiked to over 1950ms, a severe deviation from our 250ms baseline.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, this is a major concern. Section 4.2 of the NPCI security guidelines (referenced in file#fa5f856eed244c9c) explicitly requires resilient session management. A live demonstration of this failure during the audit would lead to a significant non-compliance finding.

This latency directly contributed to a 0.8% increase in `U30` (Transaction Timeout at PSP) error codes logged by the UPI gateway during that window.\n\nKibana log analysis (query filter: `service:risk-engine AND message:\"DBConnectionTimeoutException\"`) shows a surge in connection acquisition failures from the Kubernetes pods hosting the scoring service. It appears the configured connection pool limit of 200 was exhausted when transaction volume peaked at ~12,500 TPS. This aligns with the audit readiness criteria outlined in Doc#fa5f856eed244c9c, which mandates sub-200ms processing for all internal risk checks to maintain end-to-end SLA compliance.\n\n**Action Items (JIRA PAY-1211):**\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation:** @Aditya Singh, please coordinate with the SRE team to perform a controlled increase of the database connection pool size to 300 for the risk-scoring service by 4 PM today.

This prevents the issuance of a new access token.\n*   **Impact:** This has resulted in a cascading failure, with an error rate increase from <0.1% to 4.5% on affected API calls. The system fails to recover gracefully, continuously retrying with an expired token and generating a flood of 401 Unauthorized errors. This is a more severe manifestation of the concern raised in email 9a2f8f16ace243e4.\n\nFrom a risk and compliance standpoint, this level of service instability is unacceptable for a build being prepared for an NPCI audit. It directly violates our internal SLO of 99.95% uptime and presents a significant risk of being flagged as a critical finding related to system reliability and error handling.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Aditya (Dev Team):** Please treat JIRA PAY-3068 as P0.

The analysis in email 68918aaaac0e4684 and the attached data from file#fa5f856eed244c9c are alarming. A false positive rate climbing to 2.3% from our baseline of 0.4% is not sustainable and directly impacts user experience and our transaction success metrics.\n\nFrom a business and compliance perspective, we cannot go into the audit with this anomaly. NPCI will rightfully question the stability and accuracy of our risk engine, which is a cornerstone of the UPI ecosystem's integrity. Our Grafana dashboards show a clear correlation between the v2.7 model deployment and the surge in declines flagged with reason code `FRM_SUSPICIOUS_VELOCITY`. This is directly impacting our P99 transaction latency, pushing it towards 850ms in some cohorts due to the increased processing overhead for flagged transactions.\n\nWhile a rollback was discussed in email c001144dd51a4f35, we need a more robust plan that includes documentation for the auditors. We must demonstrate control and a clear understanding of the issue.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Data Science Team (cc: @priya.srinivasan):** Please prioritize the root cause analysis of the model's behavior. We need a definitive report on which features or weights are causing the excessive flags. This needs to be documented within JIRA PAY-5026 by EOD tomorrow.

This issue has become a critical blocker for our pre-audit validation activities related to Work ID 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7 and is tracked under JIRA PAY-3266.\n\nOur monitoring systems detected a sharp increase in API latency starting around 11:30 AM IST today. The p99 latency on our UPI gateway's primary payment processing endpoint spiked from a baseline of ~250ms to over 2.1s. Our Grafana dashboard (Payments-Latency-UAT) shows a corresponding surge in HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) and 504 (Gateway Timeout) errors, with the overall API error rate hitting 3.5%, well above our 0.5% SLA threshold.\n\nOur engineering team, building on the initial analysis from email 6a2e5b2af66e45f0, has confirmed the root cause is the failure of the OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow. Our client application attempts to use the `refresh_token` grant type to acquire a new `access_token` from your `/oauth/token` endpoint prior to expiry. However, these requests are consistently timing out on your end. Our Kibana logs confirm we are sending the requests correctly formatted, but we are not receiving a response within our configured 2-second timeout window. This is forcing our services into a retry cycle, which is likely exacerbating the load on your authentication service.\n\nThis instability in the core authentication mechanism is a significant concern for the upcoming NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit. Stable and secure token management is a fundamental requirement.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **NPCI Team:** Can your infrastructure team please investigate the health and performance of the `/oauth/token` service in the UAT environment? We suspect a potential resource contention or configuration issue that may have been introduced recently. We need to understand the cause of these timeouts urgently.\n\n2.  **Aditya/Juspay Team:** Please consolidate the relevant Kibana log exports and Grafana snapshots as discussed, and attach them directly to JIRA PAY-3266 for the NPCI team's reference.

I’ve cross-referenced the metrics with the audit requirements, and we have a significant deviation that needs immediate attention.\n\nMy analysis of the UPI gateway Grafana dashboard shows that p99 latency for our primary `/upi/payment/v2` authorization endpoint is intermittently spiking to over 950ms, well above our internal SLA of 400ms and a sharp increase from the pre-migration baseline of ~250ms. This corresponds to a 1.2% rise in transaction timeouts, specifically presenting as NPCI error code `U16` (Transaction timed out at PSP) in our Kibana logs. This level of performance degradation will be a major red flag for auditors, as it directly impacts system availability and transaction success rates mandated by NPCI.\n\nThe current state contradicts the performance improvements projected in the migration architecture document (ref: file#fa5f856eed244c9c). As per NPCI’s circular on system stability, we are required to maintain auditable logs demonstrating consistent performance. The current logs clearly show an anomaly that we will have to explain.\n\nTo address this for Work ID 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7, we need the following actions:\n\n1.  **Engineering:** Can you please escalate the priority of JIRA PAY-5194 to Blocker?

This resulted in the `cross-border-payment-processor` service incorrectly assigning the 'INR' currency code to approximately 4,500 transactions intended for international settlement. Consequently, the NPCI gateway rejected these transactions with a `U16 - Invalid Transaction` error code.\n\n**Technical Impact & Metrics:**\n*   **System:** Primary UPI Gateway, `cross-border-payment-processor` service.\n*   **Error Spike:** Our 'UPI-CrossBorder-Health' Grafana dashboard showed the error rate for the `/v2/payments/initiate` endpoint spiking from a baseline of 0.05% to 4.8% between 14:32 and 15:10 IST.\n*   **Latency:** P99 latency for affected transactions degraded by ~200ms due to failed transaction retries before timing out.\n*   **Logs:** A detailed analysis of the Kibana logs (query details in `file#fa5f856eed244c9c`) shows the incorrect currency mapping at the serialization stage before the API call to NPCI.\n\nFrom a risk perspective, this is a critical control failure that will be scrutinized during the upcoming NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit. A gap in our CI/CD validation for payment-sensitive configurations directly impacts our compliance posture with RBI and FEMA guidelines.\n\n**Required Mitigations & Action Items:**\n1.  **Aditya Singh (Infra):** Implement a strict schema validation check within the CI/CD pipeline for all routing rule YAML files. This gate must fail the build if currency codes and acquirer bank mappings do not match production-approved values. **Deadline: EOD Friday.** Please create a sub-task under PAY-9450 for tracking.\n2.  **Priya Sharma (SRE):** Enhance the alerting on the 'UPI-CrossBorder-Health' dashboard.

This presents a material risk for the upcoming NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit (Work ID 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7).\n\nBuilding on the initial findings from Aditya in email 7a1173962a774546, our investigation points to a state synchronization issue. Here are the specifics:\n\n1.  **Transaction Status Conflict:** Our internal transaction ledger recorded these 87 transactions as `SUCCESS`. This status was derived from a successful response (`00`) from our primary UPI gateway's status check endpoint (`/upi/v2/payment/status`).\n\n2.  **NPCI Settlement File:** The final settlement file received from NPCI (details in file#fa5f856eed244c9c) either omits these specific transaction IDs entirely or marks them with a late reversal code (`Z9 - Transaction timed out`).\n\n3.  **Root Cause Hypothesis:** It appears our reconciliation service, which runs as a Kubernetes cronjob at T+4 hours, is not correctly handling late-stage transaction status updates that occur after our initial `SUCCESS` confirmation. The Kibana logs for the `settlement-poller-service` show no subsequent checks for these transaction IDs after the first successful poll. This is a clear violation of the state machine logic defined in our compliance documentation.\n\n4.  **Correlated Latency:** These failed reconciliations are heavily concentrated between 16:00 and 16:30 IST, a window where the 'UPI-Gateway-Performance' Grafana dashboard shows a p99 latency spike from our baseline of ~180ms to over 450ms. It's likely the gateway timeouts during this period contributed to the state desynchronization.\n\nThis is a critical gap that NPCI auditors will definitely probe. We cannot proceed to the audit with this vulnerability in our settlement process.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Engineering (cc: Priya):** Please prioritize a hotfix for the `settlement-poller-service` to re-verify transaction statuses against the final NPCI report before closing the settlement window. This logic needs to be robust against late reversals.

This is a critical escalation and needs immediate cross-functional attention.\n\nBuilding on the initial findings in email c4ee585218174e80, the issue appears to be centered around the authentication flow with our third-party verification partner. The Grafana dashboard for payment onboarding is showing p99 latency for the `/v2/kyc/initiate` endpoint spiking to 2.1s, which is well above our 800ms SLA. Kibana logs associated with JIRA PAY-4664 are filled with `401 Unauthorized` responses from the vendor's API, which our service then translates into `503 Service Unavailable` errors for the client, causing the automation to fail and fall back to a manual process.\n\nMy primary concern is that this isn't a simple network timeout. It looks like our OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow is failing during the JWT token refresh cycle, but only for KYC attempts on accounts flagged by our internal fraud detection engine. This suggests a potential correlation with data complexity or request payload size for these specific user profiles. The manual fallback is not compliant with the RBI guidelines referenced in doc#fa5f856eed244c9c and will be indefensible during the NPCI audit.\n\nTo address this urgently, here are the required action items:\n\n1.  **Priya (Engineering):** Please prioritize a deep-dive investigation into the JWT token management within the KYC microservice. We need to confirm if the token is being prematurely invalidated or if there's a race condition under load. I need a full RCA by tomorrow, 12 PM IST.\n2.  **Aditya (Security):** Can you assess the security implications of this failure? Specifically, are any failed requests exposing sensitive data in logs? Please review the audit trails and confirm we are not in breach of any PCI DSS v4.0 requirements.\n3.  **Infra Team:** Please monitor the resource utilization (CPU/Memory) on the Kubernetes cluster hosting the KYC service pods. While the root cause seems to be auth-related, we need to rule out resource exhaustion as a contributing factor to the 503 errors.\n\nI have scheduled a critical incident review call for 4 PM today to align on the findings and define a remediation plan.

As flagged in email 81315970e06d4e80, our monitoring picked up a 4.2% spike in transaction failures for international VPAs, specifically those tied to NRE/NRO accounts.\n\nOur investigation of the Kibana logs revealed a surge in NPCI error code `U16` (Request authorization failed) originating from our primary UPI gateway. The issue stemmed from a misconfiguration in the routing logic deployed to our Kubernetes cluster during the last maintenance window. A new configmap, intended to optimize routing, unfortunately, lacked the correct mappings for foreign currency remittances, causing the gateway to incorrectly process these as domestic transactions and fail the settlement leg.\n\nImmediate action has been taken:\n1.  The faulty configuration was rolled back. Our Grafana dashboards confirm that the success rate for the affected transaction cohort has returned to the 99.8% baseline, and p99 latency is stable at 180ms.\n2.  All details, including logs and the problematic config file, have been documented in JIRA PAY-1461.

This incident, while resolved, touches upon critical RBI guidelines for cross-border payments. We need to demonstrate robust process controls.\n\nTo that end, the engineering team is now implementing a schema validation step in the CI/CD pipeline to prevent malformed routing rules from reaching production.

This is now a critical item for our NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit preparations under Work ID 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7.\n\nOur internal reconciliation engine has flagged a discrepancy of ₹87,312 across 114 transactions. These transactions were marked as `SUCCESS` by our UPI gateway, and our primary transaction logs confirm successful API responses from NPCI. However, they are absent from the final settlement file (SF-101) we received, causing a variance in our GL.\n\nHere are the technical specifics:\n\n*   **Systemic Issue:** The Kibana logs show that for the affected transaction IDs (full list in attached `file#fa5f856eed244c9c`), our system correctly processed the initial `PayRequest` and received a `SUCCESS` status via the `/upi/v2/payment/status` callback. The problem seems to be downstream in the settlement ingestion service.\n*   **Hypothesis:** I suspect a potential processing failure or timeout when consuming the settlement notification messages from our Kafka topic `upi-settlement-notifications`. The Grafana dashboard for this service shows a brief p99 latency spike to 1.2s around 2:15 AM, which aligns with the settlement file processing window. This could have caused the consumer to fail processing the message batch containing these transactions, without a proper dead-letter queue mechanism triggering an alert.\n*   **Compliance Impact:** This directly contravenes NPCI's circular on settlement timelines and data integrity (`NPCI/UPI/OC.No.152/2022-23`). We cannot proceed with the audit submission until we can demonstrate 100% reconciliation accuracy and have a documented RCA for any such past failures.\n\nAction items are as follows:\n\n1.  **Aditya (Payments Eng):** Please investigate the settlement ingestion service logs for the timeframe of 2:00 AM - 3:00 AM IST on June 11. Specifically, look for consumer group errors or failed acknowledgments related to the `upi-settlement-notifications` topic. The updated findings must be logged in JIRA PAY-3707 by EOD today.\n2.  **Ravi (Finance):** Please do not close the books for June 10. We need to manually adjust the ledger once engineering confirms the status of these transactions and initiates any necessary manual reconciliation with NPCI.\n\nWe need to have a fix and a preventative measure (e.g., enhanced alerting on the consumer lag or DLQ) in place by the end of this week. I will coordinate with NPCI support to understand if there were any delays or issues on their end, but the evidence currently points to an internal processing gap.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":1757918220000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","ravi.shankar@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"]}},

We're now seeing significant transaction throttling that poses a direct risk to our upcoming UPI Ecosystem Security Audit. Building on the initial alert from email 713e396e33704b01, the impact has become critical.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show a sustained ~12% drop in transaction throughput during the 2-4 PM IST peak, falling from our target 1200 TPS to an average of 1050 TPS. This is directly correlated with a spike in HTTP 429 'Too Many Requests' errors from NPCI's /v2/upi/pay endpoint. Our internal p99 latency remains stable at ~110ms, confirming the bottleneck is external.\n\nThe core of the issue seems to be a misconfigured rate limit.

This incident has direct and serious implications for our upcoming NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit (Work ID 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7), and we need a coordinated response immediately.\n\nBuilding on the initial alert from email bcf28f8d72004656, the engineering team has confirmed the root cause. A configuration push to the `payment-router-v3` service at 09:15 IST contained an incorrect rule that misclassified a segment of domestic UPI traffic as international. Specifically, any transaction with a merchant category code (MCC) in the travel sector was being incorrectly flagged with `is_international: true` before being sent to the UPI gateway.\n\n**Impact Analysis:**\n*   **Volume:** Approximately 4,500 transactions were impacted over a 22-minute window.\n*   **Error Rate:** Our Grafana monitoring shows the API success rate for `/v1/payments/process` dropped from a baseline of 99.92% to 94.5% during the incident. Affected transactions failed with NPCI error code `U69 - Transaction not permitted`.\n*   **System:** The issue was isolated to the Kubernetes pods running the new routing logic. The canary deployment was automatically rolled back by our CI/CD pipeline's health checks, but not before this subset of traffic was processed.\n\nFrom a business and compliance standpoint, this is a critical event. While the system's automated recovery worked, the initial deployment failure will be a significant point of inquiry for the NPCI auditors. It directly relates to change management controls, transaction integrity, and adherence to RBI's forex regulations. The preliminary analysis in file#fa5f856eed244c9c outlines the potential audit exposure.\n\nI have initiated JIRA PAY-1371 to track the full technical remediation and process improvements. We need to present a robust post-mortem to NPCI that demonstrates not only that we fixed the issue, but that our control plane is strengthened to prevent recurrence.

With the NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit just weeks away, we need to demonstrate a robust solution and provide clear evidence of its implementation. The current intermittent API timeouts, while not catastrophic, are a clear compliance risk and were flagged in our pre-audit checks.\n\nFrom the analysis on Slack and the Kibana logs shared by Suresh, it looks like the token refresh logic within our IAM service is hitting a race condition during peak transaction loads (~40k TPS). This is causing a cascading failure, resulting in HTTP 504 errors on the upstream payment-gateway service. The Grafana dashboard 'UPI_Gateway_Health' clearly shows a correlation between spikes in p99 latency for the `/oauth/token` endpoint and an increased transaction failure rate, which is currently at 0.8% during these events.\n\nProposed agenda and goals for this session are:\n1.  **Confirm Root Cause:** Rohan to walk us through the final diagnosis of the race condition.\n2.  **Agree on a Fix:** Review the proposed solution (e.g., implementing a distributed lock or adjusting the refresh TTL) and decide on the path forward.\n3.  **Assign Concrete Action Items & ETAs:** Define who does what and by when. This is critical for the audit trail.\n\n**Decisions & Actions:**\n-   **Decision:** We will proceed with implementing a Redis-based distributed lock for the token generation process to prevent concurrent refresh requests for the same client credentials.\n-   **Action Item (Rohan Verma):** Implement and deploy the distributed lock fix. A hotfix deployment (ID: hf-20240918-01) is authorized. **ETA: EOD Tomorrow.**\n-   **Action Item (Suresh Kumar):** Create a new, specific alert in Grafana to monitor for 'OAuth Token Refresh Contention' and set a threshold. **ETA: Friday, 12 PM.**\n-   **Action Item (Priya Nair):** I will consolidate all evidence—Jira ticket updates, deployment logs, and pre/post-fix Grafana snapshots—into the Confluence evidence package for NPCI. **ETA: Monday, 10 AM.** This will form the basis of our official response.\n\nkeywords: OAuth, NPCI Audit, UPI, Race Condition, IAM, Token Refresh, Compliance, PAY-3073","status":"confirmed","createdAt":1757925725654,"updatedAt":1757925725654,"app":"google-calendar","entity":"event","creator":{"displayName":"Priya Nair","email":"priya.nair@juspay.in"},"startTime":1757940600000,"endTime":1757944200000,"joiningLink":"https://meet.google.com/xyz-abcd-pqr","permissions":["priya.nair@juspay.in","rohan.verma@juspay.in","anjali.mehta@juspay.in","suresh.kumar@juspay.in"]}},

We have a small window to implement a fix and document the resolution before the audit fieldwork begins, so alignment is critical.\n\nOur initial investigation confirmed that a legacy rule in the payment-gateway service is misdirecting a small subset of foreign-issued UPI transactions (~0.05% of cross-border volume) to a domestic-only processor. This is causing 'Transaction Not Permitted' failures (NPCI error code Z9) and creating reconciliation breaks in the Euler ledger. The Grafana dashboard 'UPI-CrossBorder-Health' clearly shows these spikes correlating with batch processing from specific partner banks. This is a direct violation of NPCI's international routing guidelines (circular NPCI/INT/2023/07).\n\nProposed next steps for discussion and sign-off:\n1.  **Hotfix Deployment:** Ravi's team has a patch ready. The plan is to disable the legacy rule and enforce a new routing logic controlled by the feature flag `upi-intl-routing-v3`. We need to agree on the deployment timeline and rollback strategy.\n2.  **Security Review:** Meera, can you please validate the hotfix doesn't introduce new vulnerabilities, especially around PII logging for these cross-border flows?\n3.  **Impact Analysis & Reconciliation:** Sandeep will present the full list of impacted Transaction IDs pulled from the BigQuery dataset `payment_logs.upi_transactions_2024`.

The NPCI audit evidence submission is next week, and this is a critical item we must show clear remediation for. Previous Slack discussions have isolated the issue, but we need to formalize the fix and document it for the auditors.\n\nAnalysis of the BigQuery reconciliation dataset (project_id: `juspay-prod-data`, dataset: `upi_settlements_2025`) shows the discrepancy originates with transactions that time out after being sent to the remitting bank but before we receive a final callback. Our Euler ledger incorrectly marks these as 'failed' in some edge cases, while the NPCI settlement file correctly shows them as 'successful'. This creates a mismatch of approximately 0.02% of our daily volume, which is small but a clear process gap from a compliance standpoint. The Kibana dashboard 'UPI_State_Mismatch_Tracker' confirms these are not money-loss events, but state reconciliation failures.\n\nThe agreed-upon path forward is two-fold. First, for immediate audit evidence, a corrective action is required. Second, we need a permanent engineering fix to prevent recurrence. This meeting is to finalize owners and ETAs for both.\n\nProposed Actions & Decisions:\n1.  **Immediate Fix:** A corrective script will be developed to re-process the transaction logs for the last 60 days against the NPCI daily settlement reports to identify and update the state of mismatched entries in Euler. The script's logic and execution logs must be documented on the Confluence page for PAY-5577. (Owner: Ravi Kumar, ETA: Friday EOD).\n2.  **Permanent Fix:** The core payment-gateway service will be patched. The proposed logic change involves introducing a 'reconciliation hold' state and a periodic checker that validates these transactions against the final settlement file before closing the books. (Owner: Ankit Sharma, Target PR: next Monday, linked to JIRA PAY-5577).\n3.  **Audit Documentation:** I will compile the formal response for the NPCI audit team, including the root cause analysis, the immediate corrective action taken (with evidence from Ravi's script), and the plan for the permanent system enhancement.

Specifically, the feature-enrichment module, which retrieves user velocity counters and historical transaction patterns, experienced a high rate of `E_CONN_TIMEOUT` errors. This directly correlates with a surge in UPI `COLLECT` requests originating from a new gaming merchant onboarded last week. The Redis `MONITOR` command revealed a hotspot on keys following the pattern `velocity::{vpa_prefix}::{device_id}`. The current hash-slot distribution algorithm for these keys is inefficient under high-velocity, single-prefix traffic, causing read/write contention on a limited number of Redis nodes and pushing p99 latency from a baseline of 35ms to a peak of 480ms.","Immediate remediation involves implementing a client-side sharding logic within the `FraudGuard` service to introduce a salt based on the `transactionId` into the Redis key structure. The new key format will be `velocity::{vpa_prefix}::{salt}::{device_id}`, distributing the load across a wider range of hash-slots. This change will be deployed under a feature flag (`risk.engine.salted-keys.enabled`) for controlled rollout. As a long-term solution to meet NPCI's stringent performance requirements for the upcoming UPI Ecosystem audit, we propose migrating the velocity counter aggregation from a synchronous read-modify-write pattern in Redis to an asynchronous stream-processing model. This involves publishing transaction events to a dedicated Kafka topic (`upi_transactions_raw`) and using an Apache Flink job to compute and persist aggregated features into a separate, read-optimized data store, potentially ScyllaDB, to decouple it from the main transactional path.","The engineering team is tasked under JIRA ticket PAY-1566 to deliver the salted-key hotfix within the current sprint. The Flink/ScyllaDB architectural refactor will be scoped as a new epic for the next quarter. For compliance tracking, all latency metrics from our Prometheus exporters for the `FraudGuard` service will be consolidated into a dedicated Grafana dashboard (linked in metadata) to provide auditable evidence of performance stability post-fix.

Grafana metrics show a direct correlation between these timeouts and a spike in `U69` (Invalid Credentials) error responses from the NPCI gateway, occurring precisely at the 3600-second token TTL expiry mark. The current implementation allows multiple Kubernetes pods of the payment service to independently detect an expiring token and initiate a refresh request. This concurrent-refresh pattern causes the NPCI token endpoint to invalidate all but one of the new tokens, leaving other pods with stale credentials cached in their local memory for subsequent API calls, which then fail.","The proposed remediation involves centralizing the token refresh logic by implementing a distributed lock using our primary Redis cluster. We will leverage the `SETNX` (SET if Not eXists) command to ensure only a single pod can acquire a lock (e.g., `lock:npci:token:refresh`) to perform the refresh operation. The winning pod will refresh the token 90 seconds before its actual expiry and update the new credential and its TTL in a shared Redis key (e.g., `npci:auth:token`). All other service instances will exclusively read from this shared key, eliminating local credential caching and preventing the race condition. A lock TTL of 15 seconds will be enforced to prevent deadlocks in case the acquiring pod fails mid-process.","Immediate action is required to implement this locking mechanism in the `juspay-go-sdk/npci/auth` module. The change will be deployed to the UAT environment for validation against the NPCI sandbox, using a JMeter script to simulate high-concurrency requests at the point of token expiry. Upon successful validation, a canary release strategy will be initiated in production, starting with 5% of traffic. We will monitor the `npci_auth_refresh_races` and `npci_auth_failures` custom Prometheus metrics.

This is a significant deviation from our usual baseline of <0.8% and presents a material risk for the upcoming NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit, which is the focus of work 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7.\n\nBuilding on the initial analysis from file 00a3c57ab2844fd8, the operational impact is now quantifiable. Our manual review queue in the risk ops portal has increased by over 300%, and we are seeing a direct correlation with an increase in `U16` (Transaction Blocked by Remitter PSP) error codes, which could be misinterpreted by NPCI's systems as a platform stability issue rather than a fraud control measure.\n\nMy investigation points to the new rule set (v3.4.1) deployed last Tuesday. The Kibana logs show a disproportionate number of blocks on transactions between ₹100-₹500 originating from non-metro geolocations, which suggests one of the new heuristics is overly aggressive. This is not only affecting user experience but also slightly degrading our p99 latency on the UPI `/reqPay` endpoint as the model takes longer to resolve these edge cases, moving it from ~180ms to ~210ms.\n\nThis is tracked under JIRA PAY-6865. To mitigate this before the audit, I propose the following actions:\n\n1.  **Rohan (Data Science):** Please initiate an A/B test in the staging environment, running the previous rule set (v3.4.0) against the current one (v3.4.1) with production traffic replay. We need to confirm the exact source of the false positives by EOD tomorrow.\n\n2.  **Priya (Engineering):** Can we get an impact analysis on performing a targeted feature flag disablement for the new geo-velocity rules within the Sentinel service? A full model rollback is an option, but it would be preferable to surgically disable the problematic component if the underlying architecture supports it.\n\nWe must present a stable and predictable risk management framework to the NPCI auditors.

This latency is likely causing our upstream services to time out before receiving a response, triggering the 503 error. \n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is a major red flag. It not only creates a poor user experience but also directly contravenes RBI's master directions on KYC, which mandate timely and robust processing. NPCI will definitely scrutinize this during the audit, especially since it disproportionately affects high-risk profiles which are their primary area of concern.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **Aditya Singh (Engineering Lead):** Can your team please prioritize a hotfix for PAY-6949? We need a definitive root cause for the V-CIP integration latency and a plan to stabilize it. A temporary increase in the service timeout might be a stop-gap, but we need a permanent solution.\n2.  **Priya Mehta (Compliance):** Could you please prepare a formal mitigation report? This should detail the temporary manual verification process we've initiated and frame it as a proactive measure to ensure compliance integrity, referencing the framework we outlined in `file#00a3c57ab2844fd8`.\n3.  **Rohit Sharma (Self):** I will consolidate the technical findings and Priya's mitigation plan into a preliminary report. This will allow us to get ahead of any questions from NPCI.\n\nNext Steps:\nLet's schedule a war room sync for 4 PM today to review the hotfix strategy and the draft mitigation report. My goal is to have a stable fix deployed to the staging environment by EOD tomorrow and a clear, proactive communication ready for NPCI by Friday.\n\nRegards,\n\nRohit Sharma\nBusiness Development Manager | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757912760000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.mehta@juspay.in","security.team@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This is a direct follow-up to the initial strategy outlined in email 83974a2c63b5416b.\n\n**Technical Findings:**\nThe core issue lies within our `settlement-reconciliation-service` for non-INR transactions. The Grafana dashboard (Settlement-Performance-Prod) indicates that the p99 reconciliation time for batches involving USD, EUR, and AED is hitting 29.5 hours. This breaches the mandated T+1 settlement cycle and is a significant compliance gap as per the RBI guidelines referenced in file#00a3c57ab2844fd8.\n\nKibana logs from the Kubernetes pods running the reconciliation jobs show a high frequency of `504 Gateway Timeout` errors when our service calls the external forex rate provider's API. The current implementation has a simple retry logic that does not seem to handle sustained provider-side throttling, leading to job failures that require manual intervention. The error rate for these API calls peaks at 4.5% during the high-volume window (02:00-04:00 AM IST), which is unacceptable.\n\nThis will undoubtedly be flagged as a high-risk finding by the NPCI auditors. The previous incident report (email#427c15ba25084253) highlighted a similar, albeit less severe, issue which we cannot afford to repeat.\n\n**Proposed Mitigation (JIRA PAY-6497):**\nTo address this for Work ID 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7, the engineering team has proposed the following enhancements, tracked in JIRA PAY-6497:\n1.  **Introduce a Redis Caching Layer:** Implement a cache for forex rates with a 30-minute TTL. This should drastically reduce the number of outbound API calls and insulate us from transient provider issues.\n2.  **Implement Exponential Backoff:** Refactor the API client to include an exponential backoff-and-jitter strategy for retries on 5xx-class errors.\n3.  **Improve Alerting:** Configure more granular alerts in our alert management system to trigger when the p95 latency for the forex API exceeds 800ms for more than 5 minutes.\n\n**Action Items:**\n*   **Rohan:** Can you please confirm the engineering bandwidth to prioritize JIRA PAY-6497 and provide an estimated timeline for deployment to the staging environment by EOD Tuesday?\n*   **Ananya:** Please work with the finance team to quantify the impact of these settlement delays over the past 30 days. We need to prepare a business impact statement.\n*   **Siddharth (self-assigned):** I will begin drafting a proactive communication for our NPCI contact, outlining our findings and the remediation plan, pending the timeline from engineering.\n\nWe need to demonstrate a robust and timely resolution.

Digging into the Kibana logs (`index:kyc-service-*`), it appears our service is receiving a generic `400 Bad Request` from the VKYC provider's `/validateIdentity` endpoint specifically for users flagged by our internal risk model. There's no detailed error code in the response payload, which is preventing our fallback logic from executing correctly.\n\nThis has two major consequences:\n1.  **Operational Backlog:** The manual verification queue has swelled to over 850 cases. This is not sustainable and directly impacts our onboarding TAT, which is a key metric for RBI reporting.\n2.  **Compliance Gap:** The lack of a clear, auditable, and automated decision-making trail for these high-risk profiles is a direct contravention of the NPCI security guidelines (ref: `file#00a3c57ab2844fd8`, section 3.4 on Exception Handling). The auditors will almost certainly scrutinize our process for these edge cases.\n\nI have raised the priority of JIRA PAY-9497 to 'Blocker' and attached the relevant log excerpts. Aditya, can the SRE team please investigate the API contract and authentication flow for this specific endpoint?

The issue is isolated to rule `HVLF-004a` within our Sentinel-V2 fraud detection engine. This rule, designed to flag high-value, low-frequency transactions, seems to have overly aggressive thresholds following the last model update.\n\nHere are the core metrics from the analysis (detailed in file#00a3c57ab2844fd8):\n\n*   **False Positive Rate:** Spiked from a baseline of 0.8% to 2.3% over the last 48 hours, directly correlating with the rule's deployment.\n*   **Operational Impact:** This has resulted in a ~12% increase in the manual review queue for the ops team, jeopardizing our T+1 settlement SLA for several key merchants. Our Grafana dashboard shows an average of 1,500 legitimate transactions per hour being incorrectly flagged during peak loads (40k-45k TPS).\n*   **System Logs:** Kibana queries on the Sentinel-V2 logs confirm that `HVLF-004a` is the trigger for over 90% of the false positives originating from the new model.\n\nThis presents a significant operational risk and could be a point of failure in our upcoming NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit. We need to demonstrate robust model governance and rapid response to anomalies.\n\nTo mitigate this, I propose the following immediate actions:\n\n1.  **Aditya:** Please coordinate with the SRE team to disable rule `HVLF-004a` in the production environment. We need to revert to the previous state to stabilize transaction processing. Let's aim to get this done within the next 2 hours.\n2.  **Priya:** Can your team initiate an emergency recalibration of the rule's parameters? We need to analyze the transaction data from the past 72 hours and propose new, more conservative thresholds. The goal is to bring the false positive rate back under 1% without materially impacting its fraud detection efficacy.\n3.  **Anjali (Self):** I will update the risk register for this project (Work ID 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7) and prepare a formal incident report for our compliance records ahead of the NPCI review.\n\nAll progress and subsequent testing on the recalibrated model will be tracked in JIRA PAY-4379.

Building on the discussion from email c60484a5463b4e2a, we have a proposed architectural path forward, but it introduces complexities we need to mitigate proactively.\n\nThe core of the proposal, detailed in the architecture spec file#00a3c57ab2844fd8, involves integrating a new forex service provider. This will necessitate changes to our settlement batch processing system and the UPI gateway's post-transaction reconciliation logic. My primary concern is the potential impact on our settlement SLA. Introducing an external API call for forex rates could add latency. Initial staging tests show an average increase of 120ms per transaction, which pushes our p99 settlement processing time dangerously close to the threshold. We probably need a robust caching layer with a <5-minute TTL to keep this under control.\n\nFrom a security and compliance perspective, this new flow has several implications:\n\n1.  **Authentication:** The integration must use an OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow. We need to ensure the secure storage and rotation of these credentials within our Kubernetes environment, beyond just standard secrets management.\n2.  **Data Logging:** RBI guidelines mandate stringent audit trails for all forex conversions. Our current Kibana logging configuration may not capture the necessary data points from the forex API response. This needs to be explicitly added to the event schema.\n3.  **Fraud Detection:** As highlighted in email#427c15ba25084253, our existing fraud models are not trained on multi-currency velocity checks. This is a definite gap that NPCI will flag. The effort to retrain and deploy an updated model is being tracked in JIRA PAY-3679 and represents a significant dependency for this project (Work ID 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7).\n\nAction Items:\n\n*   **@Engineering Team:** Please review the spec in file#00a3c57ab2844fd8 and provide an estimate for implementing the caching solution and the required changes to the settlement processor. Please update JIRA PAY-3679 with sub-tasks by EOD Tuesday.\n*   **@Security Team:** Can you conduct a formal review of the proposed data flow and provide sign-off on the logging and authentication strategy by end of this week?

As we align our systems for the upcoming NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit (Work ID 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7), addressing this capability is becoming critical, even if the immediate audit scope focuses on INR transactions.\n\nOur current settlement engine and reconciliation process are hard-coded for INR, achieving a consistent T+1 settlement cycle. The proposal outlined in file#00a3c57ab2844fd8 to integrate a real-time FX rate provider API for currencies like USD and AED introduces significant architectural and compliance considerations. I've documented the core challenges in JIRA PAY-8397, but wanted to highlight them here for immediate attention:\n\n1.  **Settlement Discrepancy Risk:** The current reconciliation logic in our settlement system does not account for FX rate volatility between transaction authorization and final settlement. Introducing this variable without robust controls could significantly increase reconciliation failures. Our current failure rate is below 0.05%, and any new logic must be stress-tested to maintain this level. We need to define a clear process for managing discrepancies arising from FX fluctuations.\n\n2.  **Performance Impact on Settlement SLA:** The settlement batch job currently processes ~50 million transactions within a 4-hour window. Introducing a synchronous API call to an external FX provider for each currency block could add significant latency. We need an impact analysis from the backend team to ensure we don't breach our T+1 settlement SLA with partner banks.\n\n3.  **Compliance and Audit Trail:** Multi-currency settlements fall under stringent RBI and FEMA regulations. The entire process, including the source of the FX rate, the exact timestamp of conversion, and the final settled amounts in both currencies, must be logged immutably for audit purposes. We need confirmation from the compliance team that the proposed data flow meets these requirements.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **@Engineering (Praveen):** Can your team provide a high-level impact analysis by next Wednesday, detailing changes required in the settlement service and potential latency projections? Please add your findings to JIRA PAY-8397.\n*   **@Compliance (Anjali):** Could you please review the flow from a FEMA/RBI perspective and provide your assessment by the end of this week?

We are seeing a high volume of legitimate P2M transactions being incorrectly blocked with the `U69 - Transaction not permitted to VPA by PSP` response. This directly affects our transaction success rate and, from a compliance perspective, creates an audit trail that is difficult to defend. The manual review queue has grown by over 300%, and the logs in file#00a3c57ab2844fd8 show an unsustainable number of manual overrides by the operations team.

The root of the problem seems to be a status conflict between our transaction ledger and the final NPCI settlement file.\n\nTechnical Details:\n•   **Discrepancy:** Our UPI gateway recorded these transactions as `SUCCESS` with final confirmation received via the `/upi/v2/callback` endpoint. However, the NPCI settlement file (ref: `file#00a3c57ab2844fd8`) lists these same `txnIds` with a final status of `DEEMED`.\n•   **Impact:** Our automated reconciliation engine correctly flagged these as mismatches and has held the funds in suspense. This is functioning as designed, but the underlying data conflict is a significant operational risk and a clear audit failure point per RBI guidelines.\n•   **Investigation:** A check of the Kibana logs shows no anomalies in our internal state machine for these transactions.

This is directly impacting legitimate user transactions, leading to a surge in support tickets and manual review overhead. More importantly, this performance degradation presents a material weakness we must disclose and defend during the NPCI audit. The auditors will scrutinize the model's effectiveness under NPCI's real-time transaction monitoring guidelines, and a 4.5% error rate is indefensible.\n\nKibana logs confirm the issue is concentrated on P2M transactions initiated via the `/v2/transaction/initiate` endpoint, particularly for amounts below ₹500 from specific geo-locations, as initially detailed in file#00a3c57ab2844fd8.

This poses a direct risk to our readiness for the upcoming NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit.\n\nHere are the specifics from our monitoring systems:\n\n*   **Impact on Throughput:** Our primary Grafana dashboard shows a sustained drop in successful transactions per second (TPS) from our usual baseline of ~4500 TPS to ~3200 TPS during the 4 PM - 7 PM IST peak window. This is a ~29% reduction in processing capacity.\n*   **Error Rate Spike:** Kibana logs confirm a surge in HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses from the NPCI `/upi/v2/reqpay` endpoint. This has pushed our overall transaction error rate to 1.8%, far exceeding our SLA threshold of 0.2%.\n*   **Latency Degradation:** While the failed requests are skewing metrics, the p99 latency for the broader transaction pool has increased by approximately 80ms as our system's retry logic is being heavily exercised. This indicates a growing queue and potential for cascading failures.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this instability is a critical finding. The audit readiness checklist (ref file#00a3c57ab2844fd8) requires us to demonstrate stable, high-volume processing, which we currently cannot guarantee. This violates the spirit, if not the letter, of RBI's guidelines on payment system uptime and reliability.\n\nThis doesn't seem to be an internal resource constraint. Our Kubernetes pod metrics for the UPI gateway service are well within normal operating parameters. The issue appears to be an external dependency, likely a misconfiguration of the agreed-upon TPS limits discussed during our capacity planning (ref email#427c15ba25084253).\n\nAction items are as follows:\n\n1.  **Vikram:** Please immediately escalate this to our technical account manager at NPCI. Provide them with the Grafana snapshots and log excerpts. We require a root cause analysis and a firm ETA for restoring our agreed-upon TPS limit of 5000. \n2.  **SRE Team:** As a mitigation, please evaluate and deploy a more aggressive circuit breaker on the `/reqpay` endpoint to prevent our retry queue from overwhelming other services.

Building on the initial analysis from email 1dd42c219bcd44f7, our review of the transaction logs (reference file#00a3c57ab2844fd8) shows the false positive rate has spiked to approximately 2.8% since last Tuesday's deployment. This is well above our internal 0.5% target and is causing a material impact on user experience.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show a direct correlation between the new rule-set deployment and an increase in transaction declines, specifically error code 'Z9' (Transaction not permitted to VPA). The Kibana logs indicate that rule `FR-VEL-7B`, which targets transaction velocity from newly created VPAs, is the primary contributor, accounting for nearly 85% of these false positives. While the intent was to strengthen security ahead of the audit, this is blocking a significant number of legitimate P2M transfers, which will be a major red flag for the NPCI auditors.\n\nFrom a business perspective, we cannot proceed into the audit with this level of transaction friction.

We're seeing a consistent 12-15% failure rate for this cohort, which is unacceptable from a compliance and operational standpoint.\n\nOur analysis of the Kibana logs for the `KYC-Orchestrator` service indicates that we are being aggressively rate-limited by our primary verification partner. The service is receiving a high volume of `HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)` responses from their `/v2/verifyDocument` endpoint. This appears to be triggered by the intensified, multi-document check process we run for users flagged by our internal risk engine, exceeding our contracted limit of 50 TPS during peak onboarding hours.\n\nThis presents two critical risks for the upcoming NPCI audit:\n1.  **Compliance Gap:** The failure of real-time e-KYC and our reliance on a manual fallback process for a significant user segment contravenes RBI's guidelines on digital onboarding. This will be a major point of inquiry.\n2.  **System Resiliency:** While the issue is currently isolated, the logs show our Kubernetes pods for the orchestrator service are experiencing increased memory pressure and restarts due to the backlog of unprocessed jobs. This is a potential stability risk.\n\nI have updated JIRA PAY-2051 with the detailed findings. The following remediation plan is now in motion:\n\n**Immediate Action (ETA: EOD Today):** The platform engineering team is deploying a patch to the `KYC-Orchestrator` in the staging environment. This patch will introduce an exponential backoff strategy and a jitter-based retry mechanism to handle the `HTTP 429` responses more gracefully and reduce the load on the external provider's API.\n\n**Mid-Term Action (Next 3 Sprints):**\n*   **Technical:** We will scope the implementation of a Redis caching layer for verification responses with a 24-hour TTL. This should drastically reduce redundant API calls for retries or subsequent checks.\n*   **Vendor Management:** I am initiating a formal discussion with our verification partner to renegotiate our API rate limit to a minimum of 200 TPS. Concurrently, I am reactivating the evaluation of a secondary provider for failover, as outlined in our BCP documentation (ref: file#00a3c57ab2844fd8).\n\nWe will monitor the Grafana dashboards for the `KYC-Orchestrator` service in staging post-deployment. Assuming the patch is stable and error rates fall below 1%, we will schedule an emergency production release.

Building on the performance analysis from email#fad43a8242994df4, while the reduction in T+2 settlement times is significant, I've identified a critical gap in our audit trail that will be a major finding in the upcoming NPCI audit.\n\nThe current logging in the `settlement-service-v3` staging deployment captures transaction initiation and final status, but it completely omits the intermediary forex conversion step. The Kibana logs show no correlation between the UPI transaction ID and the API calls made to our forex partner. This directly contravenes RBI's requirements for end-to-end transaction traceability.\n\nSpecifically, we must log:\n1.  The full request/response payload for the forex conversion API endpoint.\n2.  The JWT token's JTI (JWT ID) used for authenticating that specific API call.\n3.  Timestamped state transitions: `PENDING_CONVERSION`, `CONVERSION_SUCCESS`, `CONVERSION_FAILED`.\n\nWithout this, we cannot prove the integrity of the foreign exchange rate applied during settlement, which is a core audit requirement. The performance gains, while impressive (I see p99 latency for the settlement job is down to ~290ms from ~480ms), cannot come at the expense of compliance. This issue is now formally tracked under JIRA PAY-1310.\n\nAdditionally, the OAuth 2.0 refresh token mechanism for the forex provider, outlined in file#00a3c57ab2844fd8, appears to use a fixed 24-hour cycle. This presents a single point of failure. If the token refresh coincides with partner downtime, it could halt all multi-currency settlements. We need a more resilient strategy, perhaps with proactive token renewal or a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff.\n\n**Action Items:**\n*   **Aditya (Eng):** Please prioritize the implementation of granular logging for the forex conversion step within `settlement-service-v3` as detailed above. Target deployment to staging by EOD Friday.\n*   **Rohan (Security):** Can you review the OAuth 2.0 flow and propose a more fault-tolerant refresh strategy?

The KYC service is experiencing a significant spike in failures—our Grafana risk monitoring dashboard shows a 60% failure rate for customers with a risk score exceeding 0.85. Kibana logs (index: `kyc-service-prod-*`) indicate that our service is generating `502 Bad Gateway` errors when calling our third-party verification partner's API. The root cause appears to be a malformed request payload; specifically, the `enhanced_due_diligence_flag` is missing, a field that seems to have become mandatory post-update as per their spec `file#00a3c57ab2844fd8`.\n\nThe operational impact is severe. Our manual KYC review queue has surged by over 700%, from a baseline of ~50 cases to over 400 currently pending.

The audit report (see findings in file#00a3c57ab2844fd8) shows that while the primary access token is revoked, the refresh token can persist in our Redis cache for up to 30 minutes. This technically creates a window for potential session replay, a direct violation of PCI DSS Requirement 8.2.1 (related to de-authorizing terminated sessions).\n\nWhile this does not impact the core UPI transaction processing through the NPCI gateway, which maintains its 99.98% uptime and sub-200ms p99 latency, it represents a significant vulnerability in the merchant-facing management layer. The NPCI audit scope explicitly includes end-to-end ecosystem security, and this will almost certainly be flagged as a major non-compliance.\n\nI’ve reviewed the Kibana logs from the auth service's Kubernetes pods; they confirm the absence of 'token.invalidate.refresh' events for sessions terminated via the /v1/auth/logout endpoint. This looks like a clear logic gap in the OAuth 2.0 flow implementation.\n\nAs discussed in my previous note (email#427c15ba25084253), my primary objective is to present a proactive and comprehensive remediation plan to NPCI.

Building on the initial alert in email c5ae9e44189547ff, we've completed a root cause analysis.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards confirm the false positive rate for P2M UPI transactions escalated to 4.2% during the 19:00-22:00 IST peak traffic window yesterday, a sharp increase from our <0.5% baseline. This is causing a direct, albeit artificial, dip in our overall transaction success rate by approximately 1.8%. The root cause seems to be a new rule set deployed last Tuesday, intended to address the anomalous patterns detailed in file#00a3c57ab2844fd8. Unfortunately, the rule's parameters are too broad and are incorrectly flagging legitimate, high-frequency transactions from merchants with specific MCCs (notably 5814 and 7995), leading to an increase in `U30 - Transaction Not Permitted` responses from our UPI gateway.\n\nThis is a critical risk for the upcoming audit. A sustained high false positive rate could be interpreted by NPCI as a platform stability issue, rather than an overly sensitive fraud model configuration, and it contravenes RBI guidelines on ensuring high availability for payment systems.\n\nTo mitigate this, we are proceeding with the following action plan:\n\n1.  **Immediate Action:** Anjali's team will disable the specific over-performing rule set via a configuration flag in our fraud engine's control plane. This does not require a full CI/CD deployment and has an ETA of 16:00 IST today.\n2.  **Model Refinement:** The Data Science team will initiate a retraining of the model, specifically to refine the feature weights that led to this issue. The goal is to create a more targeted rule that correctly identifies the fraud pattern without impacting legitimate transaction flows.\n3.  **Documentation for Audit:** I will prepare a summary incident report detailing the issue, our detection via real-time monitoring, the rapid resolution, and the steps taken to prevent recurrence. This will serve as positive evidence of our operational maturity for the NPCI audit.\n\nWe will monitor the UPI transaction error rates in Kibana closely post-rollback.

This requires immediate remediation.\n\nThe assessment flagged a failure in our automated encryption key rotation process for the primary transaction archival datastore. Specifically, the keys for the `upi_transactions_archive` PostgreSQL cluster have not been rotated in 142 days, violating our 90-day policy and PCI DSS Requirement 3.6.5. This directly impacts all archived transaction data, which NPCI will heavily scrutinize for data-at-rest protection.\n\nInitial investigation suggests the Kubernetes cron job (`kms-key-rotator-prod`) responsible for invoking the KMS API endpoint for rotation has been failing silently for the last two cycles. The corresponding alert in Prometheus (`KMSKeyRotationFailure`) was apparently misconfigured and did not trigger in our central alert management system. This is a major process gap.\n\nThis is a showstopper for the NPCI audit. We cannot proceed with the audit scheduled in three weeks with this vulnerability present. It undermines our compliance posture and the integrity of the 99.95% uptime SLA we maintain for the UPI gateway.\n\nAction items are as follows:\n\n1.  **Immediate Remediation (Owner: @Rohan Verma - Security):** Manually initiate a key rotation for the affected database cluster by EOD today. Please coordinate with the infra team to ensure no disruption to our logging pipeline, which is currently handling ~8,500 TPS at peak.\n2.  **Root Cause Fix (Owner: @Sandeep Kumar - Infra):** Debug and fix the `kms-key-rotator-prod` cron job. Validate the fix in the staging environment before deploying to production. The associated alert configuration must also be fixed and tested. This is tracked under JIRA PAY-2732, and I need it resolved within 48 hours.\n3.  **Process Improvement (Owner: @Anjali Patel - Risk):** I will define a new control to perform a weekly programmatic check of key 'last rotated' timestamps against our policy, with a manual verification step to prevent a recurrence of silent failures.\n\nI am scheduling a 30-minute emergency sync at 4:30 PM today with Rohan and Sandeep to confirm the manual rotation plan and the fix timeline for PAY-2732.

My assessment is that our current T+1 INR-only settlement system, while robust, will not meet their expanded criteria, particularly concerning real-time forex handling and reporting as detailed in their requirements (ref: file#00a3c57ab2844fd8).\n\nThis work is tracked under JIRA PAY-7922 for the overall audit readiness project (Work ID 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7).\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the primary impact is on our core settlement engine. We need to introduce a module capable of handling dynamic currency conversion for USD, EUR, and SGD transactions before batching them for settlement. This will likely require significant changes to our settlement initiation logic and the `/v1/settlements/initiate` endpoint, including modifications to the payload to carry currency and forex-related metadata.\n\nKey technical considerations we need to address immediately:\n\n1.  **Forex API Integration:** We need to finalize a vendor for real-time forex rates. The integration must not degrade our settlement performance; any external API call must have a p99 latency under 250ms to maintain our overall settlement batch processing SLA.\n\n2.  **Database & Reconciliation:** The settlement database schema will require extensions to store `original_currency`, `settlement_currency`, `forex_rate`, and a `forex_provider_tx_id`. Our reconciliation logic needs to be updated to match these new fields, targeting a reconciliation accuracy of 99.95% or higher.\n\n3.  **Monitoring & Alerting:** I expect the engineering team to create a new Grafana dashboard specifically for multi-currency settlements. We need to monitor conversion success rates, latency of the forex API, and any discrepancies (error codes 4xx/5xx from the provider). Alerts should be configured for any failure rate exceeding 0.5% over a 5-minute window.\n\n4.  **Compliance & Audit Trail:** Every currency conversion must generate an immutable audit log, compliant with RBI's cross-border payment guidelines. This log must be retrievable via an internal API for NPCI's auditors.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Engineering (cc: Aditya Singh):** Please provide a high-level technical design and effort estimate for this module by Friday, EOD. This should include the proposed API changes and database schema modifications.\n*   **Security Team:** Please review the data flow for handling foreign currency, especially regarding data residency and encryption standards, to ensure we remain compliant with PCI DSS and local regulations. An initial assessment by next Tuesday would be ideal.\n*   **Myself:** I will collate the feedback and prepare a preliminary project plan to share with NPCI by the end of next week, outlining our approach and estimated timeline.\n\nThis is a significant undertaking with a tight deadline.

The auditors have flagged a PCI DSS non-compliance issue with our JWT refresh token lifecycle for the merchant portal, which directly impacts our audit posture for Work ID 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7. \n\nThe specific vulnerability, now tracked under JIRA PAY-6412, is related to the expiry of JWT refresh tokens issued by our `/v2/merchant/auth` endpoint. Currently, the Time-to-Live (TTL) is configured for 90 days. This is a direct violation of PCI DSS Requirement 8.2.4 regarding session management and inactivity timeouts. While our short-lived access tokens are compliant, this oversight with the refresh mechanism presents a significant security risk. The auditor's detailed finding is in file#00a3c57ab2844fd8.\n\nOur analysis of the auth service logs in Kibana confirms that approximately 1,500 active merchant sessions are associated with these long-lived tokens. There is no evidence of compromise, but the exposure must be mitigated immediately.\n\nHere is the required plan of action:\n\n1.  **Security Team (@priya.sharma):** Please prioritize and deploy a hotfix to reduce the refresh token TTL to a compliant 24-hour window. This change must be pushed to production by EOD tomorrow, 17-Oct-2024.\n2.  **Infra Team (@rajesh.kumar):** Please support the accelerated CI/CD pipeline for this hotfix, including verification in the staging environment before production deployment.\n3.  **Security/Infra:** Post-deployment, all existing refresh tokens must be programmatically invalidated from the authentication database and our Redis caching layer to force re-authentication for all users.\n4.  **Vendor Success (My team):** We will coordinate with the merchant communication team to prepare and send an advisory to all merchants regarding a mandatory re-login. Building on the communication strategy from email 5ddcf0569fc54eac is advisable.\n\nWe must provide a formal remediation report to NPCI by this Friday, 19-Oct-2024.

The optimization proposed in JIRA PAY-5809 seems to introduce a risk we must mitigate.\n\nWhile I agree with the performance benefits outlined in Aditya's analysis (email#b8bb0b61d9e64ed7), the proposed batching logic for non-INR currencies (e.g., USD, AED) aggregates transactions in a way that might obscure the one-to-one mapping required for the NPCI Settlement Report (NSR) file generation. This could be flagged as a critical finding.\n\n**Technical Details & Compliance Risk:**\n\n1.  **Current State:** Our settlement microservice currently makes discrete API calls to the reconciliation engine for each transaction, ensuring an atomic audit trail for forex conversion rates and timestamps. This aligns with RBI guidelines on forex transaction transparency.\n2.  **Proposed State (PAY-5809):** The new design uses a consolidated endpoint (`/settlement/v2/batch-process`) to reduce API chatter, projecting a p95 latency drop from ~850ms to ~400ms. However, it appears to apply a single, batch-level forex rate. This is problematic if the market rate fluctuates within the batch window, as the audit trail for individual transactions becomes ambiguous.\n3.  **Log Analysis:** I checked the Kibana logs from the staging environment running this new logic (query attached). The transaction-level metadata for the exact `forexConversionRate` and `forexTimestamp` is not being explicitly logged for each child transaction within the batch. Our audit tooling relies on these fields being indexed.\n\nThis lack of granular data integrity directly impacts our ability to prove compliance with NPCI's requirement for auditable, per-transaction settlement records.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Aditya (Engineering):** Can you investigate modifying the `/settlement/v2/batch-process` endpoint to accept and process an array of individual transaction objects, each with its own forex metadata, within the batch request? We need to retain the per-transaction audit trail without reverting the performance gains entirely. The deadline for this assessment is EOD tomorrow.\n*   **Rohan (Product):** We need to formally document this risk and the agreed mitigation strategy in the risk register for Work ID 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7. This is a required evidence artifact for the audit.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nI am scheduling a 30-minute mandatory sync for 10:00 AM tomorrow to finalize the technical path forward.

The p99 latency for our primary UPI gateway is now exceeding 1,500ms under a simulated load of 75k TPS, a significant deviation from our baseline of ~180ms. This is a critical blocker for the upcoming NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit (Work ID 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7) and puts our readiness in jeopardy.\n\nThe initial analysis from the infra team, building on the thread in email 08d613c91c6d4747, strongly suggests the bottleneck is within the new CBS module's database connection handling. The Grafana dashboards show our primary DB connection pool is hitting 100% saturation, while the read replicas are not scaling as expected. This is leading to a cascade failure, resulting in a 3.5% transaction failure rate with error code `U69` (Transaction timed out) from the NPCI simulator. Kibana logs confirm a high number of `ConnectionAcquireTimeoutException` errors originating from the payment processing service.\n\nAs per NPCI's circular (ref: file#00a3c57ab2844fd8), sub-500ms p99 latency is a strict requirement. At 3x this limit, we will not pass the performance validation stage of the audit. The detailed logs and performance graphs from the test run have been uploaded to JIRA PAY-9842 for a full breakdown.\n\nAction items are as follows:\n\n1.  **Infra Team (Rohan):** Please conduct an immediate deep-dive into the Kubernetes pod scaling and the RDS proxy configuration for the new CBS database. We need a root cause analysis and a hotfix plan by EOD tomorrow. The query optimization discussion from email#427c15ba25084253 might be relevant here.\n\n2.  **Dev Team (Priya):** Can you review the data access layer in the CBS integration? Specifically, check for any long-running transactions or inefficient queries that could be causing deadlocks or prolonged connection holding.\n\n3.  **Anjali (Self):** I will draft a risk mitigation report outlining this issue and its potential impact on the audit timeline. I will also prepare a preliminary communication for our NPCI contact to manage expectations if a fix isn't deployed by Friday.\n\nWe need to convene for an emergency sync at 10:00 AM tomorrow to review all findings.

Building on the initial analysis in email f48c4148512b4ed3, the business impact is becoming more pronounced and requires immediate intervention.\n\nOur primary Risk-Analytics Grafana dashboard shows the false positive rate for P2M UPI transactions has spiked from a stable baseline of 0.15% to a sustained 2.8% over the last 48 hours. This is directly impacting user experience and our transaction metrics. We're observing a corresponding 1.2% dip in our overall payment success rate, with Kibana logs showing a surge in transactions failing with the internal code `FRD_BLOCKED` before they even reach the UPI gateway. For the end-user, this surfaces as a generic 'Transaction Declined by Bank' message, leading to repeat attempts and customer support queries.\n\nThe Risk Engineering team is tracking this under JIRA PAY-5580. The current hypothesis is that the new heuristics-based rule set, deployed Tuesday via our standard CI/CD pipeline, is overly aggressive for low-value, high-frequency transactions. This is a significant concern for the NPCI audit, as model stability and low impact on legitimate transactions are key assessment criteria outlined in their security guidelines (as detailed in file#00a3c57ab2844fd8).\n\nPresenting a system with this level of instability could jeopardize our compliance posture. We need to demonstrate control and rapid remediation capabilities.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **Risk Engineering Team:** Please prioritize the rollback of the new rule set in the staging environment for verification by EOD today. We need a clear plan and timeline for the production rollback, assuming staging tests are successful.\n2.  **Aditya Singh:** Can you prepare a post-mortem analysis focusing on the pre-deployment testing gaps that allowed these rules to pass?

Since the 04:30 UTC deployment, we've observed a 72% transaction failure rate for cross-border payments originating from Singaporean partner merchants. Prometheus metrics show our HyperSwitch orchestration layer is incorrectly routing these transactions through the standard `NPCI_DOMESTIC_V2` gateway profile instead of the designated `NPCI_LITE_X_OFFLINE` profile. This results in NPCI's host returning a `U30 - Debit has failed` error code, as the requests lack the required Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) compliance data block, which is only appended by the LITE X service.","The root cause has been isolated to an outdated Merchant Category Code (MCC) mapping within the `payment-router-rules.yaml` ConfigMap deployed to our EKS cluster. The current configuration fails to include the new MCC range `5540-5542` (Automated Fuel Dispensers, cross-border pilot) in the rule-set for the `NPCI_LITE_X_OFFLINE` profile. Consequently, the default fallback rule diverts these transactions to the domestic rail, causing the processing failure. The transaction logs in our Elasticsearch cluster (index: `hyperswitch-logs-prod-*`) confirm this routing path for all failed transaction IDs associated with this issue.","The immediate remediation is to apply a patched version of the `payment-router-rules.yaml` ConfigMap. A hotfix branch (`hotfix/PAY-1794-mcc-routing`) has been created in our GitLab infra repository. The proposed change correctly associates the `5540-5542` MCC range with the LITE X profile. The deployment plan is to first apply this to the `staging-sg` environment and run the full `TestCrossBorderOffline` regression suite against the NPCI UAT simulator. Upon successful validation (target: 100% pass rate), we will initiate a canary deployment to 10% of production pods, closely monitoring the 'UPI LITE X - Success & Latency' Grafana dashboard for 30 minutes before proceeding with a full rollout."],"owner":"Arjun Mehta","ownerEmail":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","photoLink":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/photo2","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arjun.mehta@juspay.in","tech-leads@juspay.in","product-team@juspay.in","compliance@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"application/json","createdAt":1757910600000,"updatedAt":1757910600000}},

Our fraud detection model is generating an unsustainable rate of false positives, directly impacting projected user experience and transaction success rates.\n\nBuilding on the initial analysis from file 2031d3210dfb4960, our monitoring has confirmed a significant issue. Over the past 72 hours, our Grafana dashboards show the false positive rate for offline transactions originating from our test user group has spiked from a baseline of 0.8% to 4.5%. This is causing a corresponding rise in transaction declines, logged on our side with an internal error code `DECL_FRD_04` (Proactive Fraud Rule Triggered). \n\nOur engineering lead, Aditya Singh, has analyzed the transaction logs in Kibana, and the pattern seems to point toward the risk engine rules being overly aggressive for the small-ticket, high-frequency nature of offline payments. Specifically, transactions under ₹100 from newly activated LITE X accounts are being flagged at a disproportionately high rate. This behavior was not prevalent during the initial sandbox testing phase and appears to be a new development post the last rule-engine update on your end.\n\nFrom a business and compliance standpoint, a 4.5% decline rate due to false positives is untenable for a successful launch. It directly undermines the core promise of seamless, near-100% successful offline payments and could lead to significant customer grievances, which we are required to monitor as per RBI guidelines.\n\nWe have documented this issue comprehensively in our internal tracker, JIRA PAY-4810.\n\nTo resolve this, we propose the following actions:\n\n1.  **Immediate Review:** We request your fraud and risk management team to urgently review the active rule configurations applied to Juspay’s BINs within the UPI LITE X ecosystem.\n2.  **Collaborative Tuning:** We need to schedule a joint-session to fine-tune the model's sensitivity. We believe adjusting the velocity and frequency parameters for transactions below the ₹200 threshold could mitigate this without materially increasing risk.\n3.  **Whitelist Test Cohort:** As a temporary measure, can we explore whitelisting our internal test user cohort to allow for unimpeded end-to-end testing of other system components while we resolve the fraud model issue?\n\nPlease let us know the earliest availability of your technical team for a call to address this.

Starting around 11:30 AM IST, our Grafana dashboards lit up with a sustained spike in `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors originating from their `/v2/debit/offline` endpoint.\n\nOur transaction success rate has plummeted from a baseline of 99.8% to an average of 85.3% over the last hour. Our current load test configuration is designed to ramp up to our contractually agreed 500 TPS, but it appears we are being hard-limited at approximately 280-300 TPS. This is a more aggressive and sustained throttling than the intermittent issues noted in email 12070c64af4c4b3f last week.\n\nKibana logs confirm the error pattern and show our retry mechanism (with exponential backoff) is functioning, but this is driving the p99 latency for affected transactions from an acceptable 250ms to over 2.1s, which is unacceptable for a near-real-time offline payment experience. I have attached the relevant log queries and performance graphs to JIRA PAY-6778 for a complete audit trail.\n\nThis bottleneck directly jeopardizes our ability to complete UAT by the end of next week and puts the entire project timeline at risk. Given the RBI's stringent deadlines for offline payment solutions, we cannot afford this delay.\n\nAction Items:\n\n1.  **Siddharth (Me):** I am escalating this immediately with our primary contacts at NPCI, citing the SLA clauses outlined in our partnership agreement (ref: file#2031d3210dfb4960) that guarantee a minimum of 1000 TPS on their staging infrastructure.

Building on the initial findings in email f2e51e58cdb14bb4, we've isolated the issue to API interactions during the offline payment flow.\n\nOur Grafana monitoring shows that for users flagged under your internal Risk Category 3 and 4, the KYC verification step is failing at a rate of approximately 14.5%. This is a significant deviation from the sub-0.1% error rate for all other user segments. Kibana logs indicate that our requests to the `/v2/kyc/verify` endpoint are consistently met with an `HTTP 403 Forbidden` response for this cohort, returning the error code `E701 - ACCESS_DENIED`.\n\nWe've validated our OAuth 2.0 implementation and confirmed that the JWT bearer tokens are correctly generated, signed, and not expired at the time of the request. The p99 latency for these failed requests spikes to over 2100ms before our service times them out, which points towards a potential processing bottleneck or access control list (ACL) issue on the NPCI side rather than a simple authentication failure.

The analysis builds on the initial framework discussed in email 8b86338672da4860.\n\nDuring staging environment load tests, our settlement-batch-processor service experienced severe delays when handling transactions involving foreign currencies. A simulated batch of 80,000 transactions with a 7% multi-currency mix (USD, AED) took over 4.5 hours to process. For comparison, our domestic-only batches of a similar size complete in under 40 minutes. This processing time is unacceptable and poses a compliance risk under current RBI guidelines.\n\nOur investigation points to the real-time currency conversion API endpoint as the root cause. Key findings from our monitoring stack:\n\n1.  **High Latency:** The Grafana dashboard for our NPCI gateway shows p99 latencies for the conversion API endpoint spiking to 2.2s per call during batch processing.\n2.  **Rate Limiting:** After approximately 2,500 consecutive API calls, we begin receiving `HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)` errors. This undocumented rate limit is causing our retry queue to back up, leading to cascading delays. The behavior was not specified in the documentation provided in email 12070c64af4c4b3f.\n3.  **Inefficient Model:** The current per-transaction synchronous conversion model is not scalable for the transaction volumes we anticipate with UPI LITE X.\n\nWe need to explore a more robust architecture. The file-based SFTP approach mentioned in the archived spec `file#2031d3210dfb4960` seems like a much more resilient alternative. It would consolidate thousands of API calls into a single, asynchronous file exchange.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **[NPCI Team]** Can you please provide the official rate-limiting documentation for the currency conversion API? We need the exact thresholds to implement proper throttling on our side as a temporary fix.\n*   **[NPCI Team]** Are you open to discussing a file-based or a bulk/asynchronous API for multi-currency settlement instead of the current real-time model? \n*   **[Priya Singh - Internal]** Could you model the financial and compliance risk if a portion of these settlements slips to a T+2 cycle? \n\nI have attached the detailed Kibana log exports and Grafana dashboard snapshots to JIRA PAY-9976 for your review.

This requirement strictly prohibits the storage of sensitive authentication data post-authorization.\n\nOur internal investigation, which builds upon the initial concerns raised in email cc650975cb994cb1, indicates the issue may stem from the data payload returned by the `/v2/offline/debit` endpoint. It appears a token, which could be reverse-engineered to derive the original Primary Account Number (PAN), is being temporarily cached in an unencrypted state on the device's local storage before settlement.

Building on the initial investigation from email ebea591e6e764247, we have confirmed a net settlement mismatch of ₹1,42,150.75 across 87 transactions.\n\nOur analysis involved a three-way comparison between our UPI gateway logs, transaction status responses from your `/v2/getTxnStatus` API endpoint, and the final settlement report (file ref: `SETL_JUSP_UPI_15062024.csv`). The discrepancy seems to originate from transactions that our system marked as `SUCCESS` but were absent from the final settlement file provided by NPCI.\n\nKey technical findings from our side (tracked in JIRA PAY-1570):\n\n1.  **Transaction Lifecycle:** Kibana logs for the affected transaction IDs (e.g., JUSPAYTXN789543... to JUSPAYTXN789630...) show a successful transaction confirmation from our gateway with an average p95 latency of 210ms. We received a `SUCCESS` status from the initial transaction processing call.\n\n2.  **API Inconsistency:** Subsequent asynchronous queries to the `/v2/getTxnStatus` API for these transactions also returned a `SUCCESS` state. However, they were not included in the final batch settlement file.\n\n3.  **Hypothesis:** Our engineering team believes this could be a race condition specific to the offline NFC handshake. It's plausible that a transaction is confirmed to the POS device and our gateway, but a subsequent acknowledgment to the NPCI core processing system fails or times out. This might trigger an auto-reversal on your end that is not propagated back to us via a reversal notification, creating a state mismatch.\n\nThis issue poses a direct risk to our merchant payout SLAs and compliance with RBI's T+1 settlement timelines. A sample of 10 transaction IDs exhibiting this behavior is available in the reconciliation analysis attached (ref file#2031d3210dfb4960).\n\nAction Required:\n\n*   **NPCI Team:** Could you please investigate the complete lifecycle for these 87 transaction IDs within your core system? We need to understand the final state recorded in your ledger and the specific reason (e.g., error code, timeout reason) for their exclusion from the settlement file.\n*   **Juspay Team:** We have initiated a review of our internal state machine to introduce an additional verification step against the settlement file to flag such discrepancies more rapidly.\n\nWe would like to schedule a technical call for tomorrow, June 16th, at 11:00 AM IST to review your findings and align on a permanent resolution.

The current limit appears to be ~5,500 requests per minute from our Kubernetes egress IPs, whereas our projected load requires a minimum of 18,000.\n*   **Latency Impact:** The constant throttling is causing our internal retry mechanism within the payment-orchestrator service to activate frequently.

Kibana logs for our services show the delay occurs after the request is forwarded to the NPCI environment, strongly suggesting the performance issue resides within the transaction processing layer post-handover. The timing aligns perfectly with the migration window mentioned in email#12070c64af4c4b3f.\n\nThis level of performance degradation is a blocker for our production readiness and raises concerns about meeting RBI's real-time processing guidelines for offline payments, which require strict adherence and auditability.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **NPCI Team:** Please investigate the processing latency within your new core banking system and confirm if this is a known issue or a configuration problem.

This is a deviation from the performance baseline we jointly established, as detailed in my previous summary (ref: email 26a514f45a92493b).\n\nHere are the specifics from our side:\n\n• **Metric:** The p99 latency on the `/risk/v2/evaluate` endpoint spiked from an average of 180ms to sustained periods of 850ms+ yesterday between 16:30 and 17:15 IST.\n• **Impact:** This is directly causing a 1.2% increase in our UAT transaction failure rate, primarily with NPCI error code `U69` (Transaction timed out at acquirer). Our internal JIRA ticket for this is PAY-8607.\n• **Internal Investigation:** Our engineering team (cc'd) has reviewed the Kibana logs and Grafana dashboards. The issue doesn't appear to be on our end. Our Kubernetes cluster auto-scaling is nominal, and the OAuth 2.0 JWT token generation and validation flow is stable at ~45ms, well within the SLA. The delay is occurring after our request is sent to your endpoint and before we receive a response.\n\nOur current hypothesis, based on the transaction profiles outlined in file#2031d3210dfb4960, is that specific high-frequency, low-value offline payment simulations may be triggering a more computationally intensive rule set within your scoring engine. Our TPS remained steady at ~15k during the incident window, so this doesn't seem to be a load-induced problem.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, maintaining sub-200ms latency is a critical success factor for the proximity payment use cases that UPI LITE X targets. A persistent latency issue could jeopardize the user experience and our ability to meet the stringent performance requirements mandated by RBI for instant payments.\n\nTo move forward, could your team please:\n1.  Investigate the server-side performance for API calls originating from our UAT environment, specifically for merchant IDs `JUSPAYLITEX_UAT_001` through `JUSPAYLITEX_UAT_020`.\n2.

The discrepancy in batch `SETL-LITEX-20240924-03` is confirmed at ₹1,15,450, affecting a total of 873 transactions.\n\nOur investigation, cross-referencing our Kibana logs against the settlement file provided (ref file#2031d3210dfb4960), points to a specific pattern. It appears transactions that received an NPCI response code `U99` (Transaction not completed / sync timeout) at our UPI gateway are nevertheless being included in the final settlement report from your end as successful debits. Our automated reconciliation service is, correctly, flagging these as mismatches, preventing the batch from closing.\n\nThis creates a critical issue for our financial operations and our ability to meet RBI's T+1 settlement timeline. The root cause seems to be a state misalignment between the transaction status communicated via the real-time API response and the status used for generating the batch settlement file.\n\nFor your immediate investigation, here are three sample `juspay_txn_id`s and their corresponding `npci_txn_id`s that exhibit this behavior:\n- `JPTXN959488A01`: `NPCI4A6F8B2C1D0E3F5`\n- `JPTXN959488B02`: `NPCI7G9H1J3K4L5M6N7`\n- `JPTXN959488C03`: `NPCI0P1Q2R3S4T5U6V8`\n\nInternally, we have raised JIRA ticket PAY-9774 to track this issue.

Our projections, based on the pilot merchant cohort, require a sustained throughput of at least 1,500 TPS to handle peak offline transaction volumes without causing user-facing failures or significant queuing delays on our side.\n\nBuilding on the analysis from email 90f4fdb45f9e45c8, we have conclusively ruled out issues with our JWT token generation or OAuth flow. The tokens are valid and refreshing correctly. Our Kubernetes cluster has scaled our UPI gateway pods appropriately, and we see no resource contention (CPU/memory) on our end. The p99 latency on our internal services remains below 50ms, indicating the bottleneck is external.\n\nThis rate limit appears to be significantly lower than what was specified in the initial technical specification document. The current throttling is causing a transaction failure rate of ~4.5%, which is unacceptable for launch and does not meet the reliability standards expected under RBI guidelines for digital payments.\n\nTo resolve this, could you please investigate the rate-limiting configuration on your end for our production client ID (`JUSPAY_PROD_UAT_LITE_X`) and increase the ceiling to a minimum of 2,000 TPS?

Building on the initial analysis from email da3b5c3ccc864bc4, the root cause appears to be a persistent OAuth 2.0 token refresh failure, which is now a blocker for our pre-production testing cycles.\n\nTechnically, our Juspay UPI gateway is receiving an `invalid_grant` error from the NPCI `/token` endpoint when attempting to use the refresh token. This subsequently leads to `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` responses on subsequent API calls. The business impact is significant: our Grafana dashboards show that p99 latency for transaction initiation APIs is spiking to 2.3s, with an associated error rate of 4.8%. This is well outside the acceptable SLA of sub-300ms and <0.2% error rate required for go-live.\n\nOur engineering team has traced the issue in Kibana and confirmed the failure occurs consistently after the initial JWT access token expires.

This builds on the initial analysis from email 87230ede289e48ce. The issue is internal to our UPI gateway and does not originate from the NPCI switch.\n\nA recent configuration push introduced an overly restrictive rule in our payment routing module. Specifically, the regex for validating the Merchant Category Code (MCC) in conjunction with the acquirer country code for cross-border transactions was incorrect. This caused our system to preemptively reject valid international payments before they were forwarded to NPCI, leading to the `JSP_GW_RT_403 (Invalid Routing Configuration)` errors we observed.\n\nOur Grafana dashboard (Payments-Errors-v2) shows a sharp spike in transaction failures, reaching 14.8% for transactions originating from Singapore and UAE-based issuers, beginning around 02:15 AM IST. Kibana logs confirm these rejections correlate directly with the deployment of the new routing ruleset detailed in `file#2031d3210dfb4960`. This configuration error poses a potential compliance risk under FEMA guidelines due to incorrect handling of foreign-inward remittances, even if temporary.\n\nI have created JIRA PAY-3999 to track the resolution.

Building on the initial report in email 57a3f572388e4df6, we have now isolated the root cause.\n\nIt appears that transactions originating from our test merchants with international Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) are being incorrectly processed through a domestic-only rail. Our Kibana logs, cross-referenced with the packet captures in file#2031d3210dfb4960, consistently show your system returning a `U16 - Invalid Transaction` error. This response is characteristic of a transaction being rejected because its attributes (in this case, cross-border) are incompatible with the processing channel it was routed to. From our Grafana dashboard, the error rate for this specific transaction type spiked from <0.1% to 100% immediately following a maintenance window yesterday, impacting our entire test suite.\n\nThis incorrect routing not only blocks functional testing but also has significant compliance implications under RBI's FEMA guidelines. Cross-border transactions require distinct handling for reporting and settlement which is currently being bypassed.\n\nThe issue seems localized to the routing rules associated with Juspay's acquirer BIN. We suspect a rule is defaulting to domestic processing without correctly parsing the transaction's geographical origin or MCC flags.\n\n**Action Items:**\n1.  **NPCI Team:** Please review and correct the routing table configuration for Juspay's BINs to ensure that transactions with international MCCs are directed to the designated cross-border settlement endpoint.

This is substantially lower than the 200 TPS limit specified for the UAT environment in the technical specification document (ref: file#2031d3210dfb4960).\n*   **Impact:** Our Grafana dashboard (Payments-Errors-UAT) shows a transaction failure rate spiking to 12.5% during the test window. P99 latency for failed requests is minimal (<50ms), indicating an immediate rejection at their gateway, not a timeout on our end.\n*   **Logs:** Kibana queries on our Kubernetes UPI gateway pods show a clear pattern of successful requests followed by a barrage of 429s. There are no corresponding `401 Unauthorized` or `5xx` server-side errors, ruling out issues with our JWT token generation, which was a concern discussed in email 12070c64af4c4b3f.\n\nThis appears to be a configuration mismatch on the NPCI side. Given that we need to test scenarios up to 150 TPS to meet our pre-production validation criteria, this is now a critical path blocker. I have documented these findings in JIRA PAY-8246.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Priya:** Can you please escalate this to our technical counterparts at NPCI immediately?

This has become a critical blocker, halting all further end-to-end testing on our side.\n\nBuilding on the details shared in my previous email (ref: 6a8d5bc0ca7a436b), our engineering team has confirmed the issue is isolated to the token refresh flow. The initial JWT acquisition via the `/token` endpoint works correctly, but subsequent attempts to use the refresh token fail with a consistent `401 Unauthorized` and an `invalid_grant` error message. This occurs precisely after the initial access token's 60-minute expiry.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show a direct correlation: API calls to your transaction submission endpoint that rely on a refreshed token are failing at a 100% rate, with p99 latencies exceeding 2500ms due to timeouts. Our analysis of the Kibana logs confirms that the request payloads for the refresh flow conform to the specifications outlined in the technical documentation (ref: file#2031d3210dfb4960). This leads us to believe the refresh token is either being prematurely invalidated on the server-side or there is a configuration issue with our `juspay-uat-client` profile.\n\nThis blocker now puts our Q3 launch commitments at significant risk.

This builds on the latency report from Aditya in email 341317019f7f43df. While we initially suspected network issues, our analysis points directly to authentication.\n\n**Technical Details & Observations:**\n\n*   **Symptom:** Our services are experiencing `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors when calling the `/v2/payments/offline/transact` endpoint. Our Grafana dashboard (see linked dashboard: `payments-errors-staging`) shows a spike in these errors, reaching up to 15% of calls during failure windows (approximately every 60-90 minutes).\n*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Kibana logs from our API gateway service show that prior to the timeouts, our client attempts to use a refresh token to obtain a new JWT access token from your `/oauth/token` endpoint. These requests are timing out after 3000ms or occasionally failing with a `401 Unauthorized` error. Once we manually generate a new token, functionality is restored until the next refresh cycle fails.\n*   **JIRA Ticket:** We are tracking this under JIRA PAY-7935.\n*   **Inconsistency:** The observed behavior seems inconsistent with the token lifecycle specified in the technical specification document (file#2031d3210dfb4960), specifically concerning the refresh token's inactivity expiration.\n\nThis failure is preventing us from completing UAT and proceeding with the planned security audit, jeopardizing our Q3 rollout timeline. \n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **For NPCI:** Could your team please investigate the server logs for the `/oauth/token` endpoint corresponding to our client ID (`JUSPAY_LITEX_STG_01`) for requests between 14:00 and 16:00 IST today? We need to understand why these refresh attempts are failing.\n2.  **For NPCI:** Can you please confirm the exact configuration for access token validity (in seconds), refresh token validity (in days), and any server-side inactivity timeouts? \n3.  **For Juspay (Priya/Aditya):** Please correlate our Nginx access logs with the application logs and attach the full trace for a failed refresh attempt to JIRA PAY-7935 by EOD.\n\nWe need to resolve this urgently to get the integration back on track. Please let us know the earliest time we can sync up to debug this live if needed.\n\nRegards,\n\nSiddharth Nair\nVendor Success Manager | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757916060000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.sharma@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["upi.dev@npci.org.in","integration.support@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","IMPORTANT"]}},

Building on the initial findings from my previous email (ref: 4b70f593b2f44646), this issue is a critical blocker for Work ID 04da84ad-10cc-4e23-b547-2eb09883fb5a.\n\nOur investigation points to consistent timeouts when our KYC service calls the NPCI `/v2/customer/enhanced-verification` endpoint. Our Grafana dashboard shows p99 latency for these specific API calls spiking to over 2200ms, well above our configured 1000ms timeout. This results in a cascade failure, which we're logging internally with error code `KYC_E408_TIMEOUT`. Transaction samples and corresponding Kibana logs are detailed in the attached analysis (ref: file#2031d3210dfb4960).\n\nNotably, this only affects users flagged by our internal fraud engine, which appends additional risk parameters to the payload as required by RBI's enhanced due diligence mandate. The standard KYC flow for low-risk users remains unaffected, with an average response time of 180ms.\n\nOur hypothesis is that the increased payload size or complexity for these high-risk verifications is causing processing delays within the NPCI gateway. I recall a discussion around new risk parameters in email 12070c64af4c4b3f; it's possible this is an unintended consequence. This is tracked under JIRA PAY-5319.\n\nCould your team please investigate the server-side logs for these timeout errors? A confirmation on whether you're hitting resource limits or if a specific validation rule is causing the delay would be extremely helpful.\n\nGiven the compliance implications and the project timeline, we need to resolve this urgently. Please provide an initial assessment by 4:00 PM IST today. My engineering counterpart, Aditya, is available to join a call if a real-time debugging session is required.\n\nRegards,\n\nSiddharth Nair\nVendor Success Manager | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757916360000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["praveen.kumar@npci.org.in","upi.tech@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Let's get this locked down so we can start implementing the fix. The finding is non-negotiable and has a firm deadline from the auditors.\n\nThe audit identified that our new ingestion pipeline for UPI Lite X offline transactions is writing raw transaction payloads to the `offline_staging.upi_lite_x_raw_logs` BigQuery table without column-level encryption. While the data is tokenized via HyperSDK, the auditor flagged the token format itself as potentially reversible and thus considered sensitive data-at-rest, violating PCI DSS requirement 3.4. This is a critical gap that exposes us to compliance risk.\n\nHere's the proposed two-step action plan we need to agree on:\n\n*   **Immediate Containment (Owner: Arjun, ETA: Today EOD):** I will write and execute a backfill script to purge the sensitive fields from all historical records in the affected BigQuery table. I'll post the script for review in the #devops-security channel before running.\n*   **Permanent Fix (Owner: Priya, ETA: PR by Friday EOD):** Priya, can you take point on modifying the Dataflow job? The fix will be to apply our standard GCP KMS key (`gcp-kms://projects/juspay-prod/locations/asia-south1/keyRings/pci-data/cryptoKeys/bq-column-key`) for envelope encryption on the `transaction.payload` and `customer.identifier` columns before the data is streamed to BigQuery. This should align it with our other payment flows.\n*   **Validation (Owner: Rohan, ETA: Monday EOW):** Rohan, once the fix is in staging, please validate that the data in BigQuery is encrypted and that downstream systems, specifically the Euler ledger reconciliation process, can still decrypt and process it correctly.\n\nAditya, once validation is complete, you'll have the green light to update the audit response document. Sonia, please confirm if this plan sufficiently addresses the finding from a compliance standpoint.

Our primary Grafana dashboard for the fraud engine shows the rate is still spiking to 7.8% during peak hours, which is unacceptable and directly impacts adoption. This meeting is to decide on an immediate mitigation strategy and align on the path to a permanent fix for PAY-5998.\n\nInitial analysis from the Fraud team suggests the `low_transaction_value_velocity` rule in our model is overly sensitive for the typical UPI LITE X use case. The model was trained on higher-value online UPI data and doesn't seem to account for the frequent, small-ticket offline payments we're seeing. This is causing legitimate users to be incorrectly flagged, leading to transaction declines and support tickets.\n\nMy proposed plan is two-fold. First, an immediate tactical rollback. I can use the `upi-lite-x-fraud-model-v2.4-enabled` feature flag to revert only the UPI LITE X traffic to the previous, more stable model version (v2.3.1) by EOD. This should stop the bleeding. Second, for the long-term fix, the Fraud team needs to prioritize retraining the model with a dedicated offline transaction dataset. Ravi, we need a solid ETA for a new model version (v2.5) that can be A/B tested.\n\nTo de-risk the rollback, Anjali, I think we should set up enhanced monitoring directly on the Euler ledger for any anomalous settlement patterns from LITE X transactions. A custom Kibana alert should suffice. This will act as our safety net while the new model is being developed. Let's finalize owners and ETAs for these action items on the call.\n\nkeywords: fraud detection, false positives, UPI LITE X, model rollback, feature flag, incident response, PAY-5998","status":"confirmed","createdAt":1757923980000,"updatedAt":1757925780000,"app":"google-calendar","entity":"event","creator":{"displayName":"Arjun Mehta","email":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in"},"startTime":1757923980000,"endTime":1757927580000,"joiningLink":"https://meet.google.com/qwe-rtyu-iop","permissions":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","ravi.kumar@juspay.in","anjali.desai@juspay.in"]}},

The alert flood from last night confirms this is not a transient issue and requires an immediate decision. The core agenda is to assess the impact, decide on a rollback vs. hotfix, and assign clear action items to contain the user impact.\n\nOur analysis shows the false positive rate is now at 7.8%, a massive jump from the 0.5% baseline, which is unacceptable for the pilot. This translates to ~1,200 legitimate transactions being incorrectly flagged as 'FRM_SUS_03' per hour during peak load. The Grafana dashboard 'Fraud-Engine-Performance' clearly correlates this with deployment `deploy-id-a4b5c6` yesterday at 16:30 IST. Priya's initial check suggests the model is overly sensitive to a combination of new device IDs and transaction values in the ₹100-₹200 range, a common pattern for LITE X top-ups.\n\nAfter reviewing the risks, a hotfix is deemed too slow and uncertain. The consensus is that we need to restore service stability immediately, especially with the NPCI review coming up. Therefore, we've decided on an immediate rollback. This meeting confirms the plan and owners.\n\nDecisions & Actions:\n- **Decision:** Execute an immediate, full rollback of the Fraud Detection Engine model in production from v2.3.1 to the last stable version, v2.3.0.\n- **Action Item 1 (Owner: Arjun Mehta):** Initiate the rollback using the Ansible playbook `rollback-fraud-model.yml`. Monitor deployment and confirm service health. ETA: Next 30 minutes.

During the 18:00-20:00 IST peak load window, we are seeing a sustained rate of HTTP 429 responses coupled with the NPCI-specific error code U89 (Transaction limit exceeded). This directly correlates to a 12% spike in transaction failures within our payment orchestration layer, effectively capping our throughput at approximately 300 TPS, despite our internal Redis-backed token bucket limiter being configured for a higher threshold of 350 TPS.","As an immediate containment measure, I will deploy a configuration change to our http-client-netty service to introduce an exponential backoff strategy with added jitter for retries on U89 errors. Concurrently, for a more robust mid-term solution, I propose implementing a partitioned queueing model using RabbitMQ. This approach will involve sharding outgoing requests into multiple parallel queues, each processed by a dedicated consumer group that adheres to a specific sub-limit. This architecture will smooth out burst traffic, preventing our aggregate request volume from breaching NPCI's unpublished per-second threshold and providing more graceful degradation under load.","The permanent resolution, however, requires vendor intervention. I have compiled a detailed performance report, leveraging our Grafana dashboards, that visualizes the request volume, latency spikes, and failure correlation. This report will be formally presented to our NPCI Technical Account Manager to substantiate our request for an increased TPS quota from 350 to 500. The immediate next step is to schedule a joint technical review to present these findings and negotiate a revised SLA for the UPI LITE X integration."],"owner":"Arjun Mehta","ownerEmail":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","photoLink":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/photo8","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","arjun.mehta@juspay.in","tech-leads@juspay.in","product-team@juspay.in","compliance@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"application/json","createdAt":1757926140000,"updatedAt":1757926140000}},

The current flow utilizes a post-facto FX rate lookup via our internal ForexRateProvider service during the generation of the NPCI settlement file (SF-11). This process introduces a variable latency of approximately 45-60 minutes between the transaction sync from the device and the final reconciliation entry in our HyperionDB ledger. This latency has directly contributed to FX rate slippage, resulting in a 0.12% value discrepancy in the last quarter's cross-border pilot. These are being flagged under a new reconciliation error code, FX_RATE_MISMATCH_701, which is creating significant operational overhead for the finance team.","To mitigate this, the proposed optimization involves modifying the TransactionAggregator service to pre-fetch and cache FX rates at the time of the offline transaction synchronization, rather than during the batch settlement window. The aggregator must be updated to call the ForexRateProvider API with a new parameter, `cacheTtl=3600`, upon receiving a transaction bundle from the `syncOfflineTxns` endpoint. The retrieved `providerRate` and its corresponding `rateTimestamp` will be stored alongside the transaction payload in the Redis cache cluster (key format: `upi_lite_x_txn_{txnId}`). This pre-fetched rate will then be consumed directly by the SettlementBatchProcessor job, ensuring the rate applied for settlement is locked closer to the point of network availability, not hours later.","Immediate action is required from the Core Payments engineering team to scope the necessary model changes in both the TransactionAggregator and SettlementBatchProcessor microservices, specifically adding a `forexSettlementRate` field to the internal transaction object (tracked under JIRA sub-task PAY-1502). The DevOps team must simultaneously review the Redis cache capacity planning for `upi_lite_x_txn_*` keys to ensure the added data does not degrade P99 write latency below our 5ms SLA. Concurrently, I will engage our NPCI technical liaison to validate that this pre-caching approach and its inclusion in the batch file are compliant with the stipulations in circular NPCI/UPI/2024/Circular-31.

The p99 latency for near-field transaction processing via the /v2/upi/processOfflineTxn endpoint is spiking to over 2200ms, far exceeding our 500ms SLA target. This is causing a timeout error rate of ~3.5% during peak load simulations of just 1,500 TPS.\n\nThe preliminary analysis from our engineering team, logged in JIRA PAY-2671, strongly indicates that the issue originates from the core banking system (CBS) of one of the partner banks undergoing a planned migration. The Grafana dashboards clearly show a saturation of DB connections on their end whenever our staging environment initiates a batch settlement cycle. This confirms the potential risks we flagged in the initial analysis from file 0823d0745562439d, but the real-world impact appears much more severe than anticipated.\n\nFrom a business perspective, this puts the Q4 launch timeline at significant risk. We cannot proceed to UAT with this level of instability, as it violates our contractual uptime guarantees with merchant partners and fails to meet RBI's implicit reliability standards for digital payments infrastructure.\n\nI am escalating this to the NPCI technical team to get visibility into the partner bank's CBS migration timeline and their performance baselining post-migration. We need to understand if they have a dedicated, isolated environment for us to test against or if we need to architect a more robust queuing mechanism on our side to handle these CBS-induced delays.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **Anjali:** Please compile a comprehensive performance degradation report with relevant Kibana log snippets and Grafana dashboard exports.

This builds on the initial alert data shared in the thread (ref: email 1445597a25d64715).\n\nHere’s a summary of our findings:\n\n**Performance Impact:**\n• Our primary Grafana dashboard showed p99 latency for our internal `risk-scoring-service` API endpoint spiking from a baseline of ~120ms to sustained peaks of over 850ms yesterday between 14:30 and 15:15 IST.\n• This latency directly correlated with a 1.2% increase in transaction timeouts (Error Code: `T504`) from the UPI gateway during that window.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nKibana logs from the affected Kubernetes pods show a significant delay in the OAuth 2.0 token introspection step. The current hypothesis is that a recent configuration change in the caching layer for our auth service, intended to harden compliance as per file#0823d0745562439d, might be causing excessive cache misses during high-volume periods. This seems to be forcing repeated, synchronous lookups against our primary user database, creating a processing queue.\n\nThis is particularly concerning for the UPI LITE X offline payment flow, as any delay in real-time risk assessment jeopardizes the sub-500ms response time SLA we must maintain.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n1.  **Juspay Infra Team:** A rollback of the specific caching configuration is being deployed to our staging environment to validate this hypothesis. We expect test results by 18:00 IST today.\n2.  **NPCI Team:** Could you please confirm if you observed any corresponding timeouts or unusual patterns from your end for requests originating from our gateway IPs (203.0.113.15, 203.0.113.16) during that timeframe?

Kibana logs (index: `juspay-upi-gw-*`) show that the egress payloads sent to your `/v2/upi/lite-x/debit` endpoint are correctly formatted per the specification in file#0823d0745562439d.\n\n2.  **Latency Anomaly:** The rejection response from your end is consistently received within 120-150ms.

During this period, the P99 latency for your risk scoring API endpoint jumped from our baseline of <80ms to approximately 850ms.\n• **Transaction Failures:** This directly contributed to a 0.4% increase in transaction timeouts on our side, logged with the UPI error code U69.

Our UPI gateway, authentication services (OAuth 2.0 flow), and pre-processing layers maintained a P99 response time below 50ms throughout the incident.\n\nOur analysis of Kibana logs (cross-referenced with transaction IDs) indicates that the latency is most pronounced for transactions initiated via NFC for offline payments. The common denominator seems to be the query pattern associated with retrieving risk profiles for these specific transaction types. Our hypothesis, documented in JIRA PAY-2513, is that a recent ruleset update or a change in data indexing within your scoring engine may be causing this inefficiency, a deviation from the performance specified in Doc#0823d0745562439d.\n\nCould your engineering team please investigate the query performance for NFC-originated transactions within the UPI LITE X risk engine?

Kibana logs are showing a corresponding increase in `HTTP 504` timeout errors, with an error rate now hovering around 3.5%, which is a major breach of our 0.5% internal SLA for this integration (Work ID 04da84ad-10cc-4e23-b547-2eb09883fb5a).\n\nFurther analysis indicates the issue is not within Juspay's UPI gateway or the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow with NPCI; our JWT token management and cryptographic operations are still performing at a sub-100ms level. The latency appears to be isolated to the transaction processing leg within the newly deployed CBS. It seems the system's database connection pooling is not configured to handle our projected TPS of 50K for the LITE X offline sync process.\n\nThis level of performance degradation is a blocker for the project. The delayed transaction finality not only impacts the user experience for offline payments but also creates significant challenges for our T+1 settlement reconciliation process and introduces risk regarding RBI's processing timelines.\n\nI have logged this as a high-priority issue in JIRA PAY-1658.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **NPCI Team:** Can you please immediately escalate this to the partner bank's technical team? We need an urgent review of their CBS configuration and a root cause analysis. A potential rollback of their migration must be considered if a fix cannot be deployed within the next 24 hours.\n2.  **Juspay Engineering:** Let's prepare to route all UPI LITE X staging traffic to an alternate bank's stable environment to continue our integration testing and avoid further delays.\n\nProposing an emergency sync-up call at 4:00 PM IST today to align on a mitigation strategy.

Our Grafana monitoring dashboard shows a sustained 2.8% false positive rate over the last 24 hours for offline-originated transactions, directly impacting user experience and causing a dip in the overall success rate to 96.5% for this specific cohort.\n\nContinuing the analysis from the thread in email 40ece7b334254f68, our investigation points to the current velocity check rules being too aggressive for typical offline payment patterns. We're seeing legitimate, low-value transactions in quick succession (e.g., transit ticketing, event concessions) being incorrectly flagged by the central fraud engine during the `/validate` API call post-sync. The Kibana logs confirm that `Fraud_Rule_ID: VELO-11B` is the primary trigger for these blocks. These are not edge cases; they represent a core use case for offline payments as outlined in the initial spec (ref file#0823d0745562439d).\n\nThis issue, tracked under JIRA PAY-8678, poses a significant risk to the pilot's objectives.

A hotfix was deployed to production at 11:45 AM IST, and we have confirmed service restoration.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe incident stemmed from a configuration error within the Kubernetes ConfigMap for our `payment-router-service`. An incorrect mapping of several European Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) to a domestic-only routing profile caused our UPI gateway to reject these transactions. This resulted in a `UpiErr::RoutingFailure::InvalidMcc` error, which is consistent with the logs shared by NPCI. Our Grafana monitoring shows the error rate for this specific transaction type spiked to 4.7% between 8:00 AM and 11:30 AM IST, impacting approximately 1,200 transactions. The p99 latency for failed transactions also increased to 450ms due to routing lookup timeouts.\n\n**Resolution and Validation:**\nWe corrected the MCC-to-country-code mappings in the configuration file and triggered a rolling update of the `payment-router-service` deployment. Post-deployment monitoring via our Kibana dashboard confirms that the error rate for the affected MCCs has returned to the baseline of <0.1%. Transaction latency has stabilized, with p95 now holding steady at ~180ms. The analysis from file 0823d0745562439d was instrumental in pinpointing the exact misconfiguration.\n\n**Next Steps & Preventive Measures (JIRA: PAY-1604):**\nThis incident, while resolved, exposes a gap in our pre-deployment validation for configurations that have direct implications for RBI cross-border compliance.\n\n1.  **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement:** I am adding a pre-deployment validation step to our pipeline. This script will programmatically check the routing ConfigMap against a master list of valid MCCs and country codes to prevent a recurrence. ETA for this is EOD tomorrow.\n2.  **Expanded Test Coverage:** We will coordinate with the QA team to introduce specific regression tests in our staging environment that simulate cross-border UPI LITE X payments from various international regions.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the `npci-upi-gateway` performance closely for the next 24 hours.

Our investigation points to a misconfiguration in the payment routing rules on the NPCI side, likely stemming from the changes discussed in the previous email (ref: 22694d594e5345f8).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nOur Kibana logs show a sharp increase in `U69 - Transaction not permitted to VPA` errors, starting around 11:30 AM IST. This is exclusively affecting our merchants with international MCCs (Merchant Category Codes), specifically those under our UPI LITE X pilot for Work ID 04da84ad-10cc-4e23-b547-2eb09883fb5a. The error rate for this cohort has jumped from a baseline of <0.2% to approximately 3.8%.\n\nOur UPI gateway's Grafana dashboard indicates that all upstream services are healthy, and our OAuth 2.0 token generation and validation flow latencies are nominal (p95 at 160ms). The issue seems to be post-authentication, where transactions intended for cross-border settlement are being incorrectly routed as domestic, thereby triggering the U69 rejection at the final leg.\n\n**Business Impact & Compliance:**\n\nThis is causing a significant drop in our transaction success rate and creating reconciliation challenges. More critically, misrouting these transactions could lead to non-compliance with RBI's LRS (Liberalised Remittance Scheme) reporting requirements, which is a serious concern for us.\n\n**Action Required:**\n\nWe request the NPCI team to urgently review the routing table configuration for our assigned MIDs associated with the UPI LITE X project. The correct handling for these MCCs is detailed in the technical specification document we mutually signed off on (ref: file#0823d0745562439d). \n\nPlease provide an ETA for the fix.

This issue is preventing us from completing the non-functional testing phase.\n\nBuilding on the initial findings mentioned in the previous email (ref: 509fc52f2a5a406c), our SRE team conducted a detailed load test between 14:00 and 16:30 IST today. Here are the specific observations:\n\n1.  **Throttling Threshold:** We are consistently hitting a hard limit of approximately 250 Transactions Per Second (TPS) across all API endpoints, primarily the `/debit` and `/collect` endpoints.\n2.  **Error Response:** Once this threshold is breached, the API gateway begins returning HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) errors, leading to a sharp increase in transaction failures. Our Grafana dashboard (Dashboard ID: `upi-lite-x-staging-perf`) shows our transaction failure rate spiking from <0.1% to over 80% once the 250 TPS mark is passed.\n3.  **Test Plan Impact:** Our test plan requires us to validate system performance up to 1,200 TPS to ensure sufficient headroom for production launch, as specified in the signed-off Technical Specification Document (ref: file#0823d0745562439d). We are currently unable to test beyond 20% of this required load.\n\nThis bottleneck prevents us from gathering the necessary performance metrics on latency, resource utilization within our Kubernetes cluster, and database connection pooling under stress.

The false positive rate for transactions initiated via NFC has climbed from a baseline of 0.2% to an unacceptable 1.8% in the last 48 hours.\n\nThis is directly degrading the transaction success rate for our merchant partners, which has fallen to 97.7% from our target of 99.5%. Our Grafana dashboard 'UPI-LITE-X-Performance' shows a clear correlation between the deployment of the new model rules and this decline.\n\nOur analysis of Kibana logs, tracked under JIRA PAY-3351, suggests the model is misinterpreting device-level signals and velocity checks unique to the 'store-and-forward' nature of LITE X. It seems the logic, which performs well for standard online UPI payments, is not correctly calibrated for the nuances of the offline payload, particularly the `device_info` and `geo_location` fields. We've reviewed the technical specifications in file#0823d0745562439d, but it lacks specific guidance on tuning for these offline data characteristics.

The current implementation in our settlement-batch-processor service is not scalable for the projected transaction volume.\n\n**Technical Findings:**\n\nDuring load testing in our staging environment, the T+1 batch job exhibited significant latency. For a simulated batch of 25,000 cross-border transactions (INR to USD/EUR), we observed the following:\n\n*   **p99 Processing Latency:** 950ms per transaction, which is well above our 250ms internal SLO.\n*   **Bottleneck Source:** Log analysis in Kibana (query: `service:settlement-batch-processor AND \"external_call.forex_api\"`) shows that approximately 700ms of this latency is consumed by individual, sequential API calls to our forex partner's `/v1/fx/rates/convert` endpoint for each transaction. This sequential processing model is the primary issue.\n*   **Infrastructure Impact:** The Kubernetes pods for the settlement service are scaling rapidly to handle the queue, but CPU utilization is low while I/O wait time is extremely high, confirming the external API dependency as the bottleneck. The current HPA configuration is ineffective under these conditions.\n\nThis architecture will not meet the T+1 settlement window required by RBI guidelines once we approach the projected production volume. It also presents a significant cost issue due to the per-API call pricing model.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n\nI've opened JIRA PAY-5686 to track the implementation of a new microservice, `fx-rate-cacher`. This service will:\n\n1.  Fetch bulk currency pair rates from our forex provider every 60 seconds.\n2.  Store these rates in a dedicated Redis instance, providing sub-5ms lookup times for internal services.\n3.  The `settlement-batch-processor` will be refactored to query this internal cache instead of making external API calls per transaction. We estimate this will reduce the per-transaction processing time to under 100ms.\n4.  For audit and compliance purposes (as per SOC 2 requirements outlined in file#0823d0745562439d), each settlement record will be stamped with the `rate_cache_timestamp` to ensure full traceability.\n\n**Action Items & Queries:**\n\n*   **Priya (Finance Team):** Can you please confirm if using a forex rate cached for up to 60 seconds is acceptable for financial reconciliation? The alternative is a significant risk to meeting settlement timelines.\n*   **Ramesh (NPCI):** Does NPCI have any specific requirements for reporting the timestamp or source of the FX rate used in the consolidated settlement files? We need to ensure our proposed logging mechanism aligns with your audit requirements.\n*   **Dev Team:** Please review the initial high-level architecture outlined in JIRA PAY-5686. I will add more detailed sequence diagrams by EOD today.\n\nWe need to finalize the approach by the end of this week to keep the project on schedule.

This persisted for nearly 45 minutes.\n• **Error Rate Increase:** This latency directly contributed to a 0.8% increase in transaction timeouts on our end, presenting as Error Code: T51 (Response not received within defined time).\n• **Root Cause Analysis:** Our analysis of Kibana logs points towards a significant delay originating from the NPCI-side fraud ruleset database. It seems specific queries, which typically execute in under 50ms, were taking up to 800ms. Our internal network latency to the NPCI gateway remained stable at ~15ms, which seems to rule out connectivity issues from our production Kubernetes cluster.\n\nOur working hypothesis is a potential resource contention issue or an unindexed query execution on your database, possibly triggered by a high volume of a specific transaction pattern. We have attached the correlated log snippets from our gateway and the corresponding transaction IDs in file#0823d0745562439d for your team's review.\n\nSustained latency of this magnitude presents a potential compliance deviation from RBI's real-time fraud monitoring and reporting mandates.

This is a follow-up to my previous analysis in email 2c356cda1d554237.\n\nOur Grafana monitoring shows this spike began immediately after the model update pushed last Tuesday at approximately 11:00 AM IST. This is causing a direct impact on our transaction success rate for the LITE X flow, which has dropped from 99.8% to 96.6%. Legitimate transactions are being incorrectly declined with the internal code `F741` (High-Risk Profile).\n\nA detailed review of Kibana logs points to a specific pattern: transactions between ₹100-₹200 originating from Tier-2 and Tier-3 city network blocks are being flagged at a disproportionately high rate. Priya from our risk analytics team has reviewed the feature changes outlined in file#0823d0745562439d and believes the weighting for 'device-age' and 'transaction-velocity-per-merchant-category' might be overly calibrated for the offline, low-value transaction profile of UPI LITE X.\n\nFrom an infrastructure standpoint, our Sentry fraud engine pods on the Kubernetes cluster are healthy, with p99 response times stable at 175ms. The issue does not appear to be a performance bottleneck but rather a logical one within the model itself.\n\nTo mitigate further impact on our testing schedule for Work ID 04da84ad-10cc-4e23-b547-2eb09883fb5a, we request the following actions:\n\n1.  **Immediate Rollback Consideration:** We propose to temporarily revert to the previous model version (v2.1.4) in our staging environment to validate that it resolves the issue. We need your urgent confirmation that this rollback is permissible within the pilot's operational guidelines.\n2.  **Model Configuration Details:** Please provide the detailed rule configuration and feature weight files for the current production model so our team can perform a parallel analysis.\n\nAll tracking for this issue is consolidated under JIRA PAY-2214. We need to have this resolved before our next RBI compliance audit checkpoint at the end of the month.\n\nLet's schedule a call for 3 PM IST today to align on the next steps.

Building on my previous email (ref: 4457e69ce3e94b14), the false positive rate has now escalated to 4.2% over the last 48 hours, a sharp increase from our baseline of 0.8%.\n\nThis is directly impacting the user experience and viability of the offline payments use case for Work ID 04da84ad-10cc-4e23-b547-2eb09883fb5a. Our UAT success rate has dropped below our 99.5% target SLA, currently hovering around 95.8%, with the majority of failures returning the `U35 - Transaction Flagged as Suspicious` error code.\n\nOur internal analysis, detailed partially in file#0823d0745562439d, suggests that the new heuristic models deployed last Tuesday might be overly sensitive to the high-frequency, low-value transaction patterns characteristic of UPI LITE X. Kibana logs show a concentration of these flags on transactions under ₹100 from newly activated LITE X accounts. As you know, this pattern is expected and should not be a primary indicator of fraud for this specific product.\n\nThis issue has been formally logged in our system as JIRA PAY-8328 and is now a critical blocker for our Q3 go-live schedule. To resolve this, we have the following requests:\n\n1.  **NPCI Action:** Can your technical team please provide an immediate Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for the spike in `U35` error codes?\n2.  **NPCI Action:** We need a concrete timeline for the recalibration or, if necessary, a rollback of the specific fraud rules causing these false positives in the staging environment. We need to see the false positive rate return to sub-1% levels before proceeding.\n\nAditya Singh's team on our side will provide any necessary transaction logs or data to assist your investigation. Given the business impact, can we schedule a technical sync-up call for tomorrow to discuss the mitigation plan?

While feasible, the current proposal introduces significant architectural complexity and potential performance degradation that we need to address.\n\nOur primary concern is the requirement for real-time FX rate fetching and conversion at the Juspay gateway level. Here’s a breakdown of the anticipated impact:\n\n1.  **Settlement Reconciliation Engine:** Our current T+1 reconciliation system, `recon-engine-v3`, is highly optimized for single-currency (INR) batch processing. It maintains a discrepancy rate below 0.02% across 80M+ daily transactions. Introducing multi-currency logic would necessitate a substantial re-architecture, not just a configuration update. This core engineering effort is being tracked under JIRA PAY-6696.\n\n2.  **Transaction Latency:** Integrating a real-time call to an external FX provider API within our transaction authorization flow (`/v1/upi/offline/pay`) will likely add 90-130ms to our p99 latency. This pushes us dangerously close to the 500ms threshold we maintain for offline payment authorizations, which could impact user experience.\n\n3.  **API Schema & Dispute Management:** The current settlement and dispute resolution APIs lack dedicated fields for `original_currency`, `settlement_currency`, and `fx_rate_applied`. Handling disputes arising from FX fluctuations without these fields would be a manual, error-prone process, undermining our goal of automated reconciliation.\n\n4.  **Regulatory Reporting:** We must ensure that capturing and processing multi-currency data at this stage aligns with RBI’s reporting requirements for cross-border transactions and FEMA guidelines. The proposed data flow seems to place this compliance burden on the PSP side, which we need to validate.\n\nTo mitigate these challenges, we would like to propose two alternative approaches for your consideration:\n\n*   **Alternative A (NPCI-led Conversion):** NPCI handles the FX conversion centrally. Juspay would submit transactions in their original currency, and the final consolidated settlement file from NPCI would contain only the settled INR amounts. This centralizes the complexity and aligns with existing settlement paradigms.\n*   **Alternative B (Daily Fixed Rate):** We agree upon a daily fixed FX rate from a mutually trusted source (e.g., RBI reference rate at a specific cutoff time). This rate is then used for all transactions within a given 24-hour settlement window, dramatically simplifying reconciliation logic.\n\nCould your technical team please evaluate the feasibility of these two alternatives? We believe either option would provide a more robust and scalable solution. In the meantime, our team will continue scoping the effort for the original proposal as a fallback under PAY-6696.\n\nLet’s schedule a 30-minute technical sync early next week to discuss this further and decide on a path forward. Please let me know your availability.\n\nRegards,\n\nSiddharth Nair\nVendor Success Manager | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757916000000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["pravin.rai@npci.org.in","upi.product@npci.org.in","tech.integration@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Our performance tests in the UAT environment are being consistently throttled by what appears to be NPCI's API rate limits, a concern I'm now escalating as it blocks progress on Work ID 04da84ad-10cc-4e23-b547-2eb09883fb5a.\n\nOur engineering team ran a series of load tests this morning targeting a sustained 1,500 Transactions Per Second (TPS) to simulate peak offline payment scenarios. The results are conclusive: our transaction throughput is hard-capped at approximately 500 TPS. \n\n**Technical Observations:**\n\n*   **API Endpoint:** The throttling is occurring on the primary `/v2/pay/initiate` endpoint.\n*   **Error Response:** For every request exceeding the ~500 TPS threshold, we receive an HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` status. The response body contains `{'error_code': 'RATELIMIT_EXCEEDED', 'message': 'API calls exceeded for the given window'}`.\n*   **Monitoring Data:** The 'UPI LITE X - Staging Performance' Grafana dashboard clearly shows our successful transaction rate plateauing while the 4xx error rate spikes to over 65%. Kibana logs confirm these `429` responses originate directly from NPCI's gateway IPs.\n*   **Latency Impact:** Concurrently, the p99 latency for successful transactions degrades significantly, rising from a baseline of 220ms to over 1.9s as the system contends with the throttled requests.\n\nThis limitation directly prevents us from completing the UAT phase and validating the performance SLAs we committed to, building on the analysis from email `6c80f199b4c44eef`. We cannot sign off on the integration's readiness for production without testing our target throughput of at least 2,000 TPS.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Formal Request to NPCI (Owner: Siddharth):** I am drafting a formal request to our technical contacts at NPCI to have the UAT rate limit increased to 2,500 TPS. This is being tracked under JIRA PAY-5605.

The error rate for transactions originating from the Hyper SDK is now at 4.5%, directly tied to timeouts when our `payment-auth-service` tries to get a new token from NPCI. The Grafana dashboard 'UPI-Lite-X-Staging' shows p99 latency for the `/oauth/token` endpoint is hitting 4.2s, which is well above our 800ms SLA and causing a cascading failure.\n\nThe preliminary analysis from the Slack thread points towards a race condition. It seems multiple pods are attempting to refresh the same near-expiry token at once, and our current Redis-based locking isn't preventing this. The logs attached to PAY-7775 show multiple update queries for the same token hash just before the timeouts start. We need to confirm this is the definitive root cause and not a symptom of something else, like network saturation or an issue on NPCI's end.\n\nAgenda is straightforward: \n1. Priya to quickly demo the log correlation and pinpoint the exact code path in `payment-auth-service` that's failing. \n2. Discuss and decide on an immediate fix. The main proposal is to implement a more robust distributed lock using Redlock. I've drafted a quick infra impact assessment for this on Confluence (link will be shared). Vikram, your thoughts on a longer-term architectural change vs. this tactical fix would be great. \n3.

The emergency rollback of the fraud detection model's new rule set (commit `f4a1b3c`) stabilized the decline rate, but we can't keep it disabled. The Kibana logs confirm the false positive rate spiked to 8.7% specifically for UPI Lite X transactions under ₹100, which directly correlates with the user complaints we've been seeing. This is not just a technical issue; it's starting to impact user trust for offline payments.\n\nPriya, your initial analysis suggested the model is too sensitive to high-frequency, low-value transactions, which is the exact pattern for UPI Lite X. The core issue seems to be that the global model wasn't trained on a sufficient dataset of these offline micro-transactions. We have two primary paths forward: 1) Tweak the thresholds for Lite X transactions via a new feature flag (`fraud-engine.upi-lite-x.threshold-multiplier`), or 2) Fork a dedicated model variant and retrain it using the `bq://juspay-prod/offline_payments/upi_lite_x_logs_2024_q3` dataset. The first is faster but might be a band-aid. The second is more robust but has a longer lead time.\n\nThe goal of this meeting is to weigh the risks and decide on a path. Riya, please come with the data on user impact and merchant feedback. Sameer, we'll need your input on the acceptable risk level if we lower the thresholds temporarily. My main concern from a DevOps perspective is implementing a solution that doesn't require another emergency rollback.

The goal of this meeting is to confirm the rollback plan and assign clear owners for deeper investigation.\n\nAgenda & Proposed Actions:\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation:** Agree on executing a rollback of deployment `dep-fde-v2.3.1` to the stable `v2.3.0` via our Spinnaker pipeline.

This is causing a cascade of `U69` (Transaction not permitted by bank) response codes from the NPCI gateway, primarily for transactions under ₹100 with MCC codes 5411 and 5814. Log aggregation in our ELK stack indicates the model's feature vector for 'device_first_seen' is overly sensitive for newly provisioned LITE X accounts, incorrectly flagging legitimate first-time offline purchases. The immediate impact is a degradation of the `upi-lite-x-processor` service's P99 latency to 650ms, breaching the 450ms SLA and affecting merchant settlement batches.","As a temporary containment measure, I've pushed a hot-patch to the Kubernetes ConfigMap `fraud-model-config-prod`, raising the `min_confidence_score` from 0.85 to 0.96 for transactions flagged with `risk_reason:NEW_DEVICE_LOW_VALUE_OFFLINE`. This will reduce the volume of blocked transactions while we orchestrate a more robust solution. Monitoring is active on Grafana dashboard `d/htwunk/payments-latency` to track the immediate effect on the `U69` error rate and transaction throughput. This adjustment is a stop-gap and not a sustainable solution due to the potential increase in the undetected fraud window.","The recommended path forward involves implementing a canary deployment via our Istio service mesh. I will configure a `VirtualService` to route 80% of traffic destined for the `/processOfflineTxn` API endpoint to the previous stable model, `lite-x-fraud-detection-v1.7`, while the remaining 20% continues to hit v1.8 with the adjusted confidence threshold. This will restore service stability for the majority of users and provide the Data Science team with a live, controlled data stream from v1.8 for root cause analysis and retraining.

The core issue is the on-device encrypted payload storage, which currently utilizes the deprecated TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher suite. This represents a significant non-compliance for data-at-rest security on merchant POS devices prior to synchronization with our backend, exposing us to potential audit failure and fines. The finding mandates an immediate upgrade to a PCI-approved cipher to mitigate this risk before the formal audit commences.","Further investigation revealed two related vulnerabilities. Firstly, messages pushed to the 'upi-lite-x-offline-sync' Kafka topic for settlement lack a unique hardware identifier in the message key, creating a theoretical vector for replay attacks during batch reconciliation. Our 'gringotts-reconciliation' microservice currently exacerbates this by logging the full, unmasked transaction payload upon encountering an ERR_RECON_SIG_MISMATCH, a direct violation of data minimization principles under PCI DSS Requirement 3.4. The current failure rate associated with this error code is 0.12%, which is unacceptably high given the data exposure risk.","The remediation plan is threefold. First, an immediate hotfix must be deployed to the 'gringotts-reconciliation' service to mask sensitive PAN/account data in all log levels. Second, we must initiate a mandatory POS application update to enforce the use of the TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 cipher suite via the 'secure.storage.cipher.suite' configuration parameter. Third, the data contract for the 'upi-lite-x-offline-sync' Kafka topic must be versioned to prepend the device's SecureElementID to each message key, which will then be validated by the reconciliation service before processing. A PoC for this key schema change must be delivered by the backend team within the next sprint.","As the business lead, I will coordinate with the merchant relations team to draft and execute a communication strategy for this mandatory POS software update, highlighting the critical security enhancements. Our objective is to achieve a 95% merchant compliance rate within 45 days of the app's release to the respective app stores.

This is currently causing a ~12% failure rate for new user activations within this specific cohort, directly impacting our onboarding targets for the offline payments initiative (Work ID 04da84ad-10cc-4e23-b547-2eb09883fb5a). Over the last 48 hours, this has affected approximately 3,200 user onboarding attempts.\n\nOur internal verification confirms the following:\n\n1.  **Authentication:** The OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens used in the authorization headers are valid and being refreshed correctly pre-flight.\n2.  **Payload Integrity:** The request payload structure conforms to the v1.3 specification outlined in `file#736bbd7bfd034c6e`. All mandatory fields are populated.\n3.  **Risk Classification:** The Juspay Fraud & Risk Engine (FRE) is correctly classifying these users and populating the `customerRisk` field in the payload, in adherence with current RBI digital payment security circulars.\n\nKibana logs show our UPI gateway is successfully establishing a connection with your endpoint, with p99 latency under 250ms pre-request. The failure is an immediate application-level rejection, not a timeout or network-level issue. This leads us to suspect the issue may lie within the risk profile interpretation logic on the NPCI side, specific to the UPI LITE X context. The same risk parameters we pass are processed without issue for standard UPI transactions.\n\nWe need your immediate assistance to resolve this.

Kibana logs confirm a cascade of `ERROR_CODE: 504_GATEWAY_TIMEOUT` responses from the `/risk/v2/evaluate` endpoint during that 30-minute window, with our transaction processing service failing to get a response within its 2s timeout threshold.\n\nInterestingly, Kubernetes pod-level metrics (CPU/Memory) for the risk engine service remained stable, which seems to rule out a resource contention or scaling issue. Rohan's team has also confirmed that the upstream OAuth 2.0 service responsible for JWT token validation was operating with nominal latency (<50ms), eliminating it as a root cause.\n\nThe current hypothesis is that a specific complex rule set, probably related to geo-velocity or merchant-category checks for offline transactions, is generating an inefficient query plan when processing a batch sync from the Lite X devices. This would explain why the issue is intermittent and tied to specific transaction patterns.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Anjali (SRE):** Please initiate a deep DB query analysis on the `risk_rules_engine` cluster for the 14:30-15:00 IST timeframe.

We have some technical queries before we can finalize the implementation plan.\n\nOur current T+1 settlement system is architected for high-throughput INR processing. Integrating multi-currency capabilities requires a new microservice deployed on our Kubernetes infrastructure to handle Forex conversions. Our primary concern is the potential performance degradation. Adding a synchronous API call to a Forex provider for each currency during the batch settlement process could significantly extend our processing window, which currently averages 40 minutes for a full cycle. We project this could increase latency by 150-200%.\n\nTo proceed, we require clarification on the following points:\n\n1.  **Forex Rate API:** Could you provide the complete API specification for fetching Forex rates? We need to understand the authentication mechanism (we anticipate an OAuth 2.0 flow), expected p99 latency, and rate limits. Will the rate be provided per-transaction in the settlement file, or are we expected to make a real-time call? A static rate in the file (as hinted in email#852ac31bb31646dc) would simplify things but might not meet RBI's real-time reporting requirements.\n\n2.  **Reconciliation for Reversals/Chargebacks:** The process for handling currency fluctuations in dispute settlements is unclear. Will the refunded amount be based on the original transaction's conversion rate or the rate at the time of reversal? Any discrepancy here will cause reconciliation failures in our automated system, which we monitor closely via our Kibana dashboards.\n\n3.  **Error Handling & Idempotency:** What are the recommended retry mechanisms and error codes for the Forex and settlement confirmation APIs? Our system requires strict idempotency to prevent duplicate settlements in case of network timeouts or transient errors (e.g., error code `503 Service Unavailable`).\n\nWe have created JIRA ticket PAY-2038 to track the engineering effort required on our side.

Our services are consistently receiving `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` responses with an `{\"error\":\"invalid_grant\"}` payload when attempting to use valid refresh tokens at your `/token` endpoint. This failure to obtain new JWT access tokens is the direct cause of the downstream transaction timeouts.\n\nKibana logs confirm this pattern across our entire fleet of Kubernetes pods connecting to the UAT environment. The refresh tokens being used were issued correctly and have not been revoked or expired on our end. We have cross-verified our client credentials and request body structure against the technical specifications in file#736bbd7bfd034c6e and can confirm no changes have been made to our OAuth client configuration in the last 48 hours.\n\nGiven this, the issue seems to be isolated to the NPCI authorization server's handling of refresh token grants.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **NPCI Team:** Please investigate the authorization server logs for our client ID (`JUSPAY_LITEX_UAT`) for all requests made to the `/token` endpoint from 14:30 IST onwards.\n2.  **NPCI Team:** Can you confirm if any deployments or configuration changes were applied to the UAT OAuth 2.0 service today?\n\nThe stability of this authentication layer is a prerequisite for moving forward with Work ID 04da84ad-10cc-4e23-b547-2eb09883fb5a.

Building on the initial observations from email 5a51c6e6d9024073, the issue appears more systemic than initially thought.\n\n**Technical Details & Analysis:**\n\nOur `kyc-automation-service` is returning a `KYC_VERIFICATION_FAILED` (error code 4022) for approximately 18% of users flagged as 'high-risk' by our internal fraud detection engine. This is a material deviation from the baseline error rate of <3% for this cohort.\n\nKibana logs from the Kubernetes pods (`kyc-automation-service-b7d5c...`) show that the failure is occurring post-data retrieval from the CKYCR registry via the NPCI gateway. The NPCI API endpoint itself is stable, with p99 latency holding at a healthy ~450ms and returning a 200 OK status. The problem seems to be rooted in our internal validation logic, specifically within the `address-matching` module. It's failing on minor string discrepancies that our previous configuration tolerated, a potential side effect of the patch discussed in email 852ac31bb31646dc.\n\nThe corresponding Grafana dashboard for this service confirms a spike in 5xx errors that directly correlates with these high-risk onboarding attempts. Our overall KYC success rate for the UPI LITE X flow has consequently dropped to 96.7%, which puts our stage-gate SLA of 99.5% at risk.\n\nThis is a critical blocker for Work ID 04da84ad-10cc-4e23-b547-2eb09883fb5a. Failure to process these segments correctly poses a direct compliance risk against RBI's e-KYC mandates and could impact our go-live schedule. I have updated the details in JIRA PAY-9354.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Priya (Dev Lead):** Could your team please urgently review the `address-matching` module's fuzzy logic and tolerance parameters? The original specifications in `file#736bbd7bfd034c6e` should serve as the baseline. \n2.  **Arjun (Me):** I will prepare a rollback plan for the recent service patch. It will be staged and ready for immediate deployment by 4 PM IST today, pending team consensus.\n3.  **Rahul (QA Lead):** We will need a new regression test suite specifically targeting edge cases for high-risk user profiles to validate any proposed fix or rollback.\n\nI recommend we convene for a 30-minute emergency sync at 3:30 PM IST today to decide on a hotfix versus a full rollback.

Since approximately 14:30 IST, we are observing a sharp increase in transaction failures specifically for cross-border payments originating from our international partners' test environments. This appears to deviate from the behavior we validated last week and discussed in email #960036331b83411d.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show a failure rate climbing to 4.5% on this specific transaction type, impacting our ability to complete the certification milestone. Analysis of Kibana logs by our engineering lead, Aditya Singh, indicates that the NPCI gateway is consistently returning error code `T71 - Invalid Acquirer for Cross-Border Txn`. P99 latency for these failed requests is unusually low at ~180ms, which strongly suggests the rejection is happening at an early validation layer within your network, likely before the request hits the core processing or issuer bank systems.\n\nOur hypothesis is that a recent configuration change on your end may be incorrectly interpreting the acquirer BIN for Juspay-processed transactions when the `payerAddr` VPA originates from a non-Indian handle. We have triple-checked our request payloads sent to the `/v2/pay` endpoint, and they remain compliant with the specifications outlined in file#736bbd7bfd034c6e. The OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token generation appear to be functioning correctly, as domestic UPI LITE X transactions are succeeding with a 99.8% success rate.\n\nWe have logged this issue with high priority under JIRA ticket PAY-6894, which contains sample transaction trace IDs, full request/response payloads, and timestamps for your reference.\n\nThis is a blocker for our UAT phase with two key international merchants.

The audit has flagged our current implementation for on-device storage of the signed transaction payload as non-compliant with requirement 3.5.1 regarding cryptographic key management and storage of sensitive data at rest.\n\nOur internal investigation confirms the issue. The current SDK version uses a deterministic encryption method for caching the offline transaction data before it's batched and sent to our `/v2/upi/processOfflineTxn` endpoint. This vulnerability could theoretically allow for replay attacks or data compromise on a rooted device if the local datastore is accessed. This is tracked internally under JIRA PAY-7375.\n\nAs discussed in the previous thread (ref: email 4330d3c0afa14823), our goal is to ensure end-to-end security, not just for the transaction itself but for the data's lifecycle on the client device. The architectural diagram in file 736bbd7bfd034c6e outlines this flow. The current risk, while low, is unacceptable for a production rollout.\n\nOur security team proposes an immediate remediation plan:\n1.  **Client-Side Change:** We will update our Juspay Express SDK to implement envelope encryption for the cached transaction payload. This will involve generating a unique, single-use AES-256-GCM data encryption key (DEK) for each transaction batch, which is then encrypted with a master key stored in the platform's secure hardware (e.g., Android Keystore or iOS Secure Enclave).\n2.  **Payload Integrity:** This change will not affect the core `signedPayload` sent to NPCI, as the additional encryption layer is purely for local storage and will be unwrapped by our SDK before the API call is made. The integrity of the data passed to your systems remains unchanged.\n\nWe need your team's formal confirmation on two points:\n*   Does NPCI have any specific recommendations or prohibitions regarding on-device encryption wrappers for the Lite X payload? We need to ensure our proposed solution does not inadvertently violate any part of the UPI LITE X specification.\n*   Can you confirm that no downstream issuer or acquirer systems perform any form of client-side environmental checks that might flag our new encryption library as anomalous, potentially leading to an increase in `U30` (Transaction not permitted) or other risk-related error codes?\n\nOur target is to deploy a patched SDK to our beta merchant group by next Wednesday to meet the auditor's remediation deadline.

The issue requires your immediate attention to ensure our joint solution remains compliant.\n\nThe audit, detailed in JIRA PAY-5847, has flagged a potential gap concerning PCI DSS Requirement 3.5.1 – specifically, the protection of cryptographic keys used for the encryption of sensitive authentication data (SAD) at rest within the on-device cache.\n\nHere is a summary of the technical finding:\n\n• **Issue Context:** When an offline UPI LITE X transaction cannot be immediately reconciled, our SDK caches the encrypted transaction payload on the user's device. Our current implementation uses AES-256 for this purpose.\n• **Auditor's Finding:** The auditor noted that the symmetric key used for this on-device cache encryption is derived and managed locally within the SDK's sandboxed environment. Their concern, as documented in file#736bbd7bfd034c6e, is that this key management process may not align with the stringent key lifecycle requirements for protecting SAD, even in a temporary, offline state.\n• **Impact Analysis:** Our Kibana logs show that approximately 0.21% of offline transactions result in a `PENDING_RECONCILIATION` state due to intermittent network loss, with an average cache duration of 120 minutes. While the absolute number is low, the auditor classifies this as a high-risk finding due to the nature of the data.\n\nBuilding on the technical specifications discussed in email 399949980b7e4649, we need NPCI's formal guidance on the prescribed cryptographic standards for this specific scenario. Could you please clarify if NPCI has a certified reference for on-device key management and rotation that is validated against PCI DSS 4.0 for the LITE X offline flow?

This issue is being tracked under JIRA PAY-6001.\n\nBuilding on the initial report from email 91abb9672b89424e, we've completed a deep dive. The reconciliation failure for batch ID `STL-20240610-ULX-45B` resulted in a settlement shortfall of ₹42,157.50, impacting a total of 212 individual transactions. We cross-referenced our internal transaction logs from the `payment-processor` service (Kibana query attached) with the raw settlement data provided by NPCI in file 736bbd7bfd034c6e.\n\nHere are the technical findings:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** The discrepancy originates from transactions that received a `408 Timeout` from NPCI's `/pay` API during a peak load window (14:30 - 15:00 IST). Our system correctly marked these as 'Pending' for later reconciliation.\n2.  **Reconciliation Failure:** Our reconciliation job subsequently polled the `/getStatus` endpoint for these pending `transactionId`s. For all 212 affected transactions, the API returned an error code `T04 - Transaction not found`. Based on this response, our system finalized these transactions as 'Failed'. However, they were clearly processed successfully on NPCI's side as they appeared in the final settlement file.\n3.  **System Health:** Our monitoring indicates no internal issues. The Kubernetes pods for the UPI gateway were healthy, and our Grafana dashboards show stable latency (p99 at ~180ms) outside of the timeout events. The OAuth 2.0 flow for generating NPCI API credentials remained at a 100% success rate, ruling out authentication problems.\n\nThis behavior suggests a potential race condition or state propagation delay within the NPCI infrastructure, where a transaction that is successfully recovered after a timeout is not immediately available via the `/getStatus` API. While the current monetary impact is manageable, this desynchronization poses a significant operational risk as UPI LITE X adoption scales, and could present challenges for our T+1 settlement compliance per RBI guidelines.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **[NPCI Team]** Could you please investigate the state transition for the 212 `transactionId`s listed in the attached sheet? We need to understand the lifecycle of these transactions and why the `/getStatus` API returned `T04` for them.\n*   **[Juspay - Priya Sharma]** We need to begin designing a more resilient reconciliation mechanism. I suggest we explore a multi-stage polling strategy with increasing backoff intervals for `T04` responses on recently timed-out transactions. Let's discuss this further.\n\nWe would like to schedule a brief technical call to address this behavior and collaborate on a permanent fix.

Building on the initial observations from email 054f0c0f49a7, we have confirmed the issue lies within our UPI gateway's interaction with the NPCI /token endpoint.\n\nDuring peak test loads in our staging environment, we observed p99 latency for offline payment attempts spiking to ~1.8s, a significant deviation from our 250ms baseline. This correlates directly with a 4.5% error rate, primarily HTTP 401 Unauthorized responses. Our Grafana dashboard for 'NPCI Auth Health' clearly shows a surge in these errors. Kibana logs from the affected Kubernetes pods show a repeating pattern of `invalid_grant` errors being returned from the NPCI auth server when our service attempts to use a refresh token.\n\nOur analysis suggests a race condition within our token management logic. When a JWT is nearing expiry, multiple concurrent payment processing threads are attempting to trigger the refresh flow simultaneously. It appears the first request to the /token endpoint successfully gets a new token and invalidates the `refresh_token`, but the subsequent, near-simultaneous requests then fail with the `invalid_grant` error because they are using the now-stale refresh token. This is causing a cascade of failures until our caching layer is updated. This entire issue is being tracked under JIRA PAY-6359.\n\nAs an immediate mitigation, we have deployed a hotfix to the staging environment that implements a Redis-based distributed lock around the token refresh function. This ensures only one process can initiate a refresh at any given time, preventing the race condition. Initial tests with this fix show latency and error rates have returned to normal levels.\n\nHowever, for a permanent solution, we need some clarification from the NPCI team regarding the token endpoint's behavior as it's not fully specified in the documentation we have (file#736bbd7bfd034c6e).\n1. Is a `refresh_token` invalidated immediately upon its first use in a successful refresh call?\n2. Is there a grace period, or is this behavior part of the standard OAuth 2.0 security posture you enforce?\n\nUnderstanding this will help us finalize the design for a more robust, centralized token management service, which is critical for meeting the 99.95% uptime SLA mandated by RBI guidelines for this payment channel.\n\nNext Steps:\n- **Juspay:** Continue monitoring the hotfix performance in staging.\n- **Juspay:** Finalize the design for the long-term token management service by EOW.\n- **NPCI:** Please provide clarification on the `refresh_token` invalidation policy by tomorrow, EOD.\n\nRegards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757914920000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["upi-platform-devs@juspay.in","aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","npci.tech-support@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

The analysis builds on the initial flags raised in email 62f4b1e407154aa8.\n\nOur Grafana monitoring shows that P99 latency for debit requests to the bank's CBS endpoints has spiked from a baseline of ~300ms to over 1,900ms. This is causing widespread transaction timeouts within our UPI gateway. Consequently, the end-to-end transaction success rate in the UAT environment has dropped to 87%, which is unacceptable for the project's go-live criteria of 99.5%.\n\nKibana logs are saturated with `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors originating from our egress proxies when attempting to process these transactions. The engineering team has consolidated the technical findings, including relevant trace IDs, in JIRA ticket PAY-1170. This latency bottleneck fundamentally jeopardizes the core value proposition of near-instant offline payments for UPI LITE X and puts the Q3 launch target at risk for Work ID 04da84ad-10cc-4e23-b547-2eb09883fb5a.\n\nTo address this urgently, we propose the following actions:\n\n1.  **NPCI & Partner Bank:** Could you please provide the server-side performance profiles and application logs from the new CBS for the period between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM IST today? We need to understand where the processing time is being spent within the new architecture.\n2.  **Juspay Engineering (Attn: Priya, Sameer):** Please prepare a diagnostic report outlining our connection pooling strategy and timeout configurations for the NPCI integration module. This will be critical for a joint debugging session.\n3.  **All Stakeholders:** I am requesting an urgent, mandatory technical deep-dive call with engineers from Juspay, NPCI, and the partner bank. Please provide your availability for tomorrow, aiming for the 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM IST window.\n\nWe need to isolate the root cause within the next 48 hours to formulate a mitigation plan. This could involve configuration tuning, a temporary capacity increase on the bank's side, or, as a last resort, discussing a partial rollback of the CBS for our specific transaction set.\n\nAppreciate your immediate focus on this matter.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRohit Sharma\nBusiness Development Manager\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757915160000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["npci.tech-team@npci.org.in","priya.srinivasan@juspay.in","sameer.mehta@juspay.in","project.alpha@partnerbank.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on the initial symptoms detailed in email 4be01a61b64f4e63, our engineering team has pinpointed the root cause to a failure in the OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow when our UPI gateway attempts to connect to your endpoints.\n\nOur investigation shows that after the initial JWT access token expires (60-minute validity), subsequent calls to the `/oauth/token` endpoint using the `refresh_token` grant type are failing. Our Kibana logs show these requests are resulting in connection timeouts, with a smaller subset returning a `401 Unauthorized` with an `invalid_grant` error code, despite the refresh token being valid and within its expiry window. \n\nThis is having a direct impact on our integration testing for Work ID 04da84ad-10cc-4e23-b547-2eb09883fb5a. Our Grafana monitoring (`payments-latency` dashboard) indicates that p99 latency for payment initiation calls has spiked from a baseline of ~250ms to over 2800ms. This has caused our API error rate to climb to ~18% since 10:00 AM IST, which is unacceptable for pre-production sign-off and breaches the SLA targets defined in file#736bbd7bfd034c6e.\n\nWe have created JIRA PAY-2638 to track this internally. As a temporary mitigation, our team is implementing a full re-authentication flow, but this is an inefficient workaround that introduces unnecessary latency and load.\n\nAction items for your team:\n1.  Please investigate the OAuth service logs on your UAT environment for our client_id for all requests made since 09:30 AM IST today.\n2.  Confirm if any deployments or configuration changes were made to the authentication service in the last 24 hours.\n3.  Provide us with an incident report and a firm ETA for resolution.\n\nWe require a stable UAT environment to proceed with our performance and compliance checks.

The false positive rate has hit 4.2% over the last 24 hours, which is substantially above the project's success criterion of <0.5%. This is causing a major bottleneck in our testing cycle for Work ID 04da84ad-10cc-4e23-b547-2eb09883fb5a and risks impacting the project timeline.\n\nBuilding on the initial analysis from email 70c4be9e2e384ef4, I've dug deeper into the logs from the `fraud-detection-service` Kubernetes pods. The Kibana logs show that the majority of these flagged transactions originate from newly provisioned merchants using Tap-and-Pay for transactions under ₹200. The model seems to be incorrectly weighting transaction velocity from new terminals as a high-risk indicator. Legitimate transactions are being denied with our internal `DECLINED_SUSPECTED_FRAUD` (response code 76) before the `/v1/offline/tx/validate` request is even forwarded to the NPCI gateway.\n\nThe current state prevents us from accurately measuring system performance and completing the RBI-mandated UAT scenarios. My primary concern is that the model's feature set, as detailed in file#736bbd7bfd034c6e, may not be adequately calibrated for the unique characteristics of offline, low-value proximity payments.\n\nTo address this, I have updated JIRA PAY-3048 with the latest Grafana dashboards and log samples. My recommendation is twofold:\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation:** We should explore temporarily adjusting the risk scoring threshold for the UAT environment. This would allow testing to proceed while we work on a permanent fix. This is a tactical move and would not be promoted to production.\n2.  **Strategic Fix:** We need to schedule a priority session with the Fraud Analytics team and NPCI's technical SMEs to review and retrain the model. The current performance is not compliant with our internal risk policies or the seamless experience expected from UPI LITE X.\n\nCould the product team confirm if a temporary threshold adjustment in UAT is acceptable?

Our Grafana dashboards show a consistent 12-14% failure rate for this specific cohort over the past 48 hours. For the failing requests, we are consistently receiving an `Error Code: U34 (Invalid Customer Profile)` response.\n\nThe concerning part is that these same customer profiles, when checked manually via the NPCI partner portal, pass verification successfully. This discrepancy suggests the core customer data is valid. Our internal service latency remains nominal (p99 under 180ms), and no other KYC segments are affected, which points towards a potential issue in how the NPCI backend is processing flags for these profiles via the API. We've attached a sample of the anonymized request/response payloads in `file#736bbd7bfd034c6e` for your review.\n\nThis is a major compliance concern under RBI's enhanced due diligence (EDD) mandates and prevents us from moving forward with the UPI LITE X offline payments rollout. We are tracking this escalation under JIRA ticket PAY-1425.\n\nCould your technical team please investigate why the `/customer/verify/v2` endpoint is returning `U34` for profiles that are otherwise valid through other channels?

Can you also confirm if any changes were deployed to your risk engine in the last 72 hours?\n\nGiven the urgency, I propose a technical sync-up call between our engineering leads and your API support team tomorrow to resolve this.

Here are the specific observations from our Grafana monitoring:\n\n• **API Latency:** The p99 latency for the `/collect.pay` endpoint has degraded significantly, averaging 1,950ms against an SLA of 500ms. Pre-migration tests were consistently below 450ms.\n• **Transaction Throughput:** We are hitting a hard ceiling at approximately 9,500 TPS. Beyond this, the error rate climbs sharply. Our target is to sustain 25,000 TPS to meet peak demand projections.\n• **Error Rates:** We're observing a 3.8% failure rate, predominantly with error code `U91` (Downstream System Timeout). Our Kibana logs correlate these failures directly with response delays from the NPCI gateway. This is a substantial increase from the baseline 0.2% error rate.\n\nThese metrics strongly suggest that the new CBS infrastructure is not scaling as expected or that there's a misconfiguration in the connection pooling between the gateway and the core system. We have consolidated all relevant logs and performance graphs into JIRA PAY-4778 for your review.\n\nThis performance degradation represents a significant risk. Not only does it block our release, but it also raises concerns about our ability to adhere to RBI's processing and uptime mandates for offline payments once live.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **NPCI Team:** Please initiate an immediate investigation into the performance of the newly migrated CBS.

The Kibana logs for batch ID `B_774920240913_A` show that the `offline-tx-ingestor` service is receiving duplicate transaction IDs from the Hyper SDK during network recovery simulations. While our Euler ledger correctly rejects the duplicate write, the initial transaction attempts are still logged, causing the mismatch against the final NPCI settlement file. The total discrepancy for yesterday's batch was a minor INR 4,312.50 across 117 transactions, but this will scale and is a compliance risk.\n\nThe goal of this sync is to finalize our response. We need to agree on an immediate mitigation and a permanent fix. My investigation suggests two main paths, and I've prepared a short doc outlining the pros and cons (linked in Confluence).\n\nAgenda:\n1.  **Short-term Fix Decision:** Approve the deployment of a temporary de-duplication script. It would run against the BigQuery `raw_transactions` dataset pre-settlement to flag these specific duplicates for manual exclusion. QA effort is minimal, and this would immediately resolve the financial mismatch.\n2.  **Long-term Strategy:** Decide between (a) patching the `offline-tx-ingestor` service to introduce a more robust idempotency check using a composite key (e.g., `deviceID` + `txTimestamp` + `amount`) or (b) requesting a patch for the Hyper SDK to improve its client-side de-duplication logic before syncing.\n3.  **Action Plan:** Assign owners and set firm ETAs for development, testing (Sonia), and deployment for the chosen solutions.

My investigation points to a misconfiguration in our payment-gateway's country-code resolution logic. It appears the service is incorrectly flagging domestic transactions as cross-border when the upstream BIN lookup service times out. This is routing valid domestic payments to our international acquirer, which NPCI then correctly rejects with 'Error 57: Transaction Not Permitted'. The Grafana dashboard 'UPI-Lite-X-Health' shows a clear correlation between p99 latency spikes in the BIN service and a jump in these failure codes.\n\nI've already drafted a configuration change (PR #4112 on payment-gateway-configs) to adjust the routing rules. The proposed change introduces a fallback mechanism: if the BIN service lookup fails, the transaction will default to the primary domestic route instead of the international one. This feels like a safer default. We need to discuss the potential side effects. Is there a scenario where this could mask a legitimate cross-border transaction and cause reconciliation issues down the line? The alternative is simply increasing the service timeout, but that feels like treating the symptom, not the cause.\n\nAgenda for this call is to get alignment on this fix. 1) Priya, can your team confirm the Euler ledger won't have issues with this fallback logic? 2) Anjali, we need your approval from a FEMA/compliance standpoint. What are the reporting implications if a true international transaction is mis-routed domestically, even for a short period? 3) Rohan, we need to decide on the post-deployment monitoring plan and the rollback criteria. I've prepared a BigQuery script to track the affected transaction IDs for post-facto analysis. The goal is to deploy this fix by 6 PM IST today, pending your approvals.","status":"confirmed","createdAt":1757919900000,"updatedAt":1757919900000,"app":"google-calendar","entity":"event","creator":{"displayName":"Arjun Mehta","email":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in"},"startTime":1757921700000,"endTime":1757925300000,"joiningLink":"https://meet.google.com/xyz-pdq-abc","permissions":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","rohan.gupta@juspay.in","anjali.desai@juspay.in"]}},

Our p99 latency on the primary transaction service has jumped from our baseline of ~400ms to over 1.8s during peak load. You can see the spike clearly on the Grafana dashboard `Payment-Services-Latency-CBS`. This is a critical regression that violates the project's latency SLO and needs immediate resolution before we scale the rollout further.\n\nMy initial analysis of Kibana logs points to a high number of `ConnectionPoolTimeoutException` errors originating from the Euler ledger service. I suspect we are exhausting the database connection pool on the primary Postgres instance. This issue wasn't caught in our pre-prod environment because the load tests didn't accurately simulate the concurrent query patterns introduced by the new CBS module, especially during reconciliation batch jobs. This sync is to align on an immediate mitigation and a long-term fix.\n\nHere’s the plan for the meeting: 1) A 5-minute review of the latency and DB connection saturation dashboards. 2) Decide on an emergency increase of the HikariCP connection pool settings for the Euler service. 3) Brainstorm and assign ownership for a permanent fix – this could be query optimization, offloading reporting queries to a read-replica, or re-architecting the transaction commit sequence.

The p99 latency for payment authorizations has jumped to ~600ms since the new Core Banking System (CBS) module was enabled last Tuesday, which is well above our 250ms SLA for this flow. The Grafana dashboard 'upi-lite-preprod-latency' clearly correlates the spike with the CBS deployment window. My initial diagnosis points towards resource contention at the database layer, specifically with how our Euler ledger service interacts with the new CBS data models.\n\nThe core issue seems to be an increased number of blocking queries during transaction finalization, which is starving the connection pool. While the error rate remains stable at 0.02%, this latency is a showstopper for the PAY-7128 launch. We need to decide on a two-pronged approach: an immediate tactical fix to unblock testing and a longer-term strategic solution to address the root cause before we can even think about production deployment.\n\nHere is the proposed agenda for our discussion:\n1.  Quick confirmation of root cause analysis (5 mins).\n2.  Debate short-term mitigation: I propose a hotfix to increase the Euler service's DB connection pool by 30%. Rohan, need your input on the infrastructure impact.\n3.  Plan for long-term fix: Priya, we need your team to profile the ledger write operations against the new CBS schema. There might be an inefficient query or a missing index. We'll need a new sub-task under PAY-7128 to track this investigation.\n4.  Risk Assessment: Kavita, we need to agree on a rollback trigger. If the hotfix doesn't bring p99 latency below 300ms within 2 hours of deployment, we'll need to disable the CBS module to unblock other testing streams. Let's align on the communication plan for this scenario.\n\nOur goal is to leave this meeting with clear owners and ETAs for each action item.

The issue concerns the temporary logging of unmasked PII, specifically the `payerVpa` and `payeeVpa`, within our Redis `upi-lite-x-cache` cluster. During periods of high TPS where our primary HSM-backed tokenization service exhibits latency greater than 75ms, our Go-based payment processor microservice logs the raw transaction object before tokenization completes. These logs, streamed via Fluentd, expose sensitive VPAs in plaintext, violating the requirement to render all PAN/SAD unreadable. The audit specifically identified log entries with event code `TXN_CACHE_WRITE_FAILSAFE` as non-compliant.","Immediate remediation involves deploying a Redis Lua script to be executed via `EVAL`. This script will intercept log data destined for the stream and apply a regex-based partial masking (e.g., `arjun.mehta@okhdfc` -> `a********a@okhdfc`) directly on the Redis server, preventing the unmasked data from ever being written. This change will be deployed via our Spinnaker pipeline by EOD today. The performance impact on Redis command latency will be monitored via the `payments-latency` Grafana dashboard, with an alert threshold set for a >5ms increase in p99 latency.","For a permanent solution, as discussed in JIRA PAY-2740, we will re-architect the logging flow. Instead of logging directly from the payment processor, raw transaction data will be pushed to a new, dedicated Kafka topic named `upi-lite-x-log-sanitize-queue`. A new standalone service, `log-sanitizer`, will consume from this topic, perform robust tokenization by calling the vault service with a dedicated, high-availability endpoint, and then forward the fully compliant log to the central ELK stack. This decouples critical path transaction processing from non-essential logging operations and centralizes the sanitization logic, preventing future recurrence.

I’ve spent the morning investigating the spike in API timeouts.\n\nBuilding on the initial analysis from **file cf3e39fff3dc4c62**, the root cause appears to be a recurring OAuth 2.0 token refresh failure with ICICI's authentication server. Our Grafana dashboard for the `icici-proxy-service` shows P99 latency for transaction status calls jumping from our baseline of ~180ms to over 2,500ms. This directly correlates with an error rate spike from 0.2% to nearly 4.5%, primarily consisting of `504 Gateway Timeout` responses.\n\nDrilling down into the Kibana logs for the affected Kubernetes pods, we're seeing a clear pattern:\n1. Our service attempts to use an existing JWT access token.\n2. It receives a `401 Unauthorized` response, as expected when a token expires.\n3. Our standard OAuth refresh flow triggers, sending the `refresh_token` to ICICI's token endpoint.\n4. Instead of issuing a new access token, their server is intermittently responding with an `error: \"invalid_grant\"` message.\n\nThis `invalid_grant` error is causing our proxy to fail its refresh attempt, leading to a cascade of failed API calls until a manual token regeneration or a successful (and seemingly random) retry. The issue is intermittent, which makes it particularly frustrating to pin down, but it seems to happen under moderate load (around 1.5k TPS).

I’ve been digging into the compliance implications this morning, and this is unfortunately a critical issue for the RBI mandate implementation.\n\nThe core problem seems to be the OAuth token refresh failures with ICICI Bank's API, which is creating a downstream impact on our transaction monitoring service. Our Grafana dashboard for the ICICI gateway shows p99 latency for the `/v1/transactions/report` endpoint spiking from a baseline of ~220ms to over 2.5s. Even more concerning, the error rate has jumped from 0.2% to 4.8% over the past 24 hours.\n\nLooking at the Kibana logs, there's a clear pattern of our service calling ICICI's `/v2/auth/token` endpoint, which is then intermittently returning `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` instead of a new JWT. This directly causes the subsequent transaction reporting calls to fail with `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` as our Kubernetes pods are stuck waiting for a valid token.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, this is a significant risk. We are effectively losing real-time visibility on a subset of transactions, which goes against the core requirement of the mandate for Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3. We cannot have these gaps in our audit logs, especially with the reporting deadline approaching.\n\nAs documented in their API specification (file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62), the agreed-upon SLA for their auth service is 99.95% uptime, which is clearly not being met. I have updated JIRA PAY-7809 with log snippets and dashboard screenshots.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **Engineering Team (Aditya):** Can we implement a temporary mitigation, perhaps a more aggressive retry logic with exponential backoff on the token refresh calls? It won't fix the root cause, but it might reduce the number of failed transaction reports.\n2.  **Vendor Management:** We need to escalate this immediately with our technical account manager at ICICI Bank.

For this segment, we're seeing a sustained failure rate of over 40% when our KYC service attempts to call ICICI's `v2/customer/ekyc/verify` endpoint. This is a huge jump from the sub-1% error rate for standard-risk profiles and is causing a significant backlog.\n\nDrilling down into the Kibana logs (I've linked the query in JIRA PAY-5259), the majority of responses are HTTP `422 Unprocessable Entity` with the error message `INVALID_RISK_PROFILE`. Our request payloads, however, appear to be perfectly aligned with the API specification outlined in Doc#cf3e39fff3dc4c62. We're passing the risk category correctly. The Grafana dashboard for this API integration shows P99 latency for these failed requests climbing to ~2.1s, which suggests their system is attempting to process it before failing, rather than it being a simple validation error at the gateway.\n\nThis high failure rate means we cannot satisfy the mandate's real-time monitoring requirement for high-risk accounts. The manual fallback is not scalable and introduces an operational risk that will not pass our next audit.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **ICICI Team (cc'd):** Can you please investigate on your end why the `v2/customer/ekyc/verify` endpoint is rejecting valid requests for the `HIGH_RISK_MERCHANT` profile?

Building on the initial analysis from your email (ref: ce428036e6a84fd8), our security team has completed its investigation, and I want to provide a transparent update to everyone involved in the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring project (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\n**Context & Impact:**\nOur scheduled PCI DSS audit has identified a critical vulnerability in our staging environment. Specifically, the Kibana logs for our UPI gateway's ICICI adaptor service were found to be capturing and storing unmasked Primary Account Numbers (PAN) from test transactions. This is a clear violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.3 and poses a significant risk, even in a non-production environment. This is a blocker for our UAT sign-off, and we are treating it with the highest priority. The issue is being tracked under JIRA PAY-8629.\n\n**Technical Root Cause Analysis:**\nA debug-level logging configuration was mistakenly promoted to the staging Kubernetes deployment via our CI/CD pipeline. The logging middleware for our primary transaction processing endpoint (`/icici/v2/payment/process`) was configured to dump the full unencrypted request body on any non-200 response, which, while useful for debugging latency spikes (we were seeing p99 latencies of up to 1.8s), is not compliant. This oversight occurred during a stress test last week where we were pushing ~50K TPS to identify bottlenecks.\n\n**Immediate Remediation Steps:**\n1.  **Hotfix Deployment:** Our SRE team has already prepared a hotfix to enforce PAN masking at the application level, irrespective of the environment's logging verbosity. This will be deployed to the staging environment by 5:00 PM IST today.\n2.  **Log Purge:** We have purged all non-compliant log entries from our Kibana instance for the affected index (transaction-logs-staging-*). \n3.  **Process Review:** We are conducting an immediate review of our CI/CD pipeline's approval gates to prevent insecure configurations from being deployed, reinforcing the principles we established in Doc#84461a5d6eb14c12.\n\n**For the ICICI Team (Ankit):**\nFor full transparency, we are bringing this to your attention. While all traffic between our systems is secured with TLS 1.3 and our OAuth 2.0 flow with JWT token validation remains secure, we want to ensure there is zero risk on your side. Could you please confirm that your UAT environment's logs do not persist raw request payloads from our endpoints? We will pause all further UAT transactions for the next 24 hours to validate our fix, which may slightly impact the timeline discussed in our last call (ref: email 2c249b20b87b4978).\n\nWe deeply regret this oversight and the potential disruption. Our commitment to security and compliance is absolute, and we are taking swift action to rectify this process failure.

Our UPI gateway is receiving HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses once our transaction volume exceeds approximately 500 TPS. This is significantly below our required peak capacity of 2,000 TPS needed to service our top merchants during flash sales.\n\nHere are the specifics from our monitoring:\n\n*   **Grafana Dashboard:** I've attached a performance chart (ref: file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62) which clearly shows the 429 error count spiking in direct correlation with transaction volume increases. P99 latency for this specific API call degrades from a baseline of ~250ms to over 2.5s as our client-side exponential backoff logic kicks in, which is an unacceptable customer experience.\n*   **Kibana Logs:** Log queries confirm the throttling is originating from the vendor's side. The error message is unambiguous. We've ruled out any issues with our OAuth 2.0 token generation or JWT caching; our side of the integration is functioning as per their documentation.\n*   **Impact:** The error rate for these transactions has jumped from a healthy 0.2% to an alarming 4.5% during the test windows. Extrapolated to production volumes, this would result in thousands of failed payments per minute and would put us in breach of our 99.95% uptime SLA.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, this throttling prevents us from performing the mandatory real-time transaction screening at scale, putting the entire project timeline at risk. We can't sign off on SOC 2 compliance for this workflow with such a significant bottleneck.\n\nI've created JIRA PAY-1041 to track this with high priority. My immediate concern is that this rate limit might be the default for all clients, and we need to get a specific exception.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Arjun (Me):** I will prepare a formal technical summary to be shared with the ICICI Bank technical team, detailing our required TPS and observed limitations.\n2.  **Aditya (You):** Could you please escalate this with our relationship manager at ICICI? We urgently need to get their engineering team on a call to confirm the current rate limits on our API key and formally request an increase to a minimum of 2,500 TPS to provide a safe operational buffer.\n\nLet me know once you hear back.

Your analysis of the root cause for the ICICI UPI settlement mismatch is very helpful.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this discrepancy is a significant concern for our reporting under the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring Mandate (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3). The initial alert from Meera in finance (ref: email#2c249b20b87b4978) is now fully substantiated.\n\nI've cross-verified the list of 152 RRNs you shared in the reconciliation failure CSV (file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62) against our transaction audit logs in Kibana. We are consistently seeing transactions marked as `TXN_SUCCESS` via the real-time API response from ICICI, only for them to be marked as `TXN_FAILED` or be missing entirely in their T+1 settlement file. This is causing a daily reconciliation gap of over INR 1.2 Lakhs and creates a serious audit and reporting issue.\n\nThe manual reconciliation effort is not scalable and undermines the automated controls we've built. More critically, it creates an inaccurate financial position that could lead to non-compliance with the RBI mandate. I have updated JIRA PAY-2312 with these notes and attached the transaction logs for audit traceability.\n\nYour theory about a potential race condition between their real-time transaction processing and batch settlement file generation seems plausible. Could you please check our Grafana dashboards and logs for any increased P99 latency (anything over 800ms) or timeout errors from ICICI's `/upi/v2/payment/status` endpoint corresponding to the timestamps of the failed transactions? Any pattern there would be a smoking gun.\n\nWe need to escalate this to ICICI's technical team formally. My concern is that their system might not guarantee status consistency between the API and settlement files, which is a major integration flaw.\n\n**Action Items:**\n1.  **Aditya:** Please investigate the logs for API latency spikes or error codes from ICICI's status endpoint for the affected RRNs.\n2.  **Rohan (PM):** Can you please initiate contact with our Technical Account Manager at ICICI to schedule a high-priority call? We need their senior engineers and product owners on the line.\n3.  **Me (Priya):** I will draft a formal communication detailing the compliance risk and the specific discrepancies, referencing the technical data from our investigation.\n\nLet’s aim to get a call with ICICI scheduled by the end of this week.

Building on the thread from your email 2432f2e27c8a43b9, my team has investigated the spike in cross-border payment routing errors with ICICI Bank.\n\nHere’s what we've found:\n\nThe issue is isolated to transactions processed through ICICI's `/v2/payments/initiateCrossBorder` endpoint. Between 14:00 and 16:30 IST yesterday, we saw a sustained error rate of 4.2% for these transactions, which is significantly above our 0.5% alerting threshold. Our Kibana log queries show these are failing downstream at the NPCI gateway with error code `U16 - Invalid transaction type`.\n\nWe have validated our request payloads against ICICI's API specification document (ref: file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62). The `transaction_details.country_code` and `merchant.mcc` fields are being populated correctly from our end. Our OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token generation for authentication are functioning within expected parameters, with P99 latencies for our part of the flow holding steady at ~250ms. This points to an issue downstream from our systems.\n\nOur leading hypothesis is a misconfiguration in ICICI's routing logic. It appears to be incorrectly classifying certain international transactions (specifically for MCCs 5815 and 5816) as domestic, triggering the rejection by NPCI. This is a critical failure for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3), as it directly impacts the integrity of our audit trail and compliance reporting. This concern was also raised in our earlier discussion (ref: email#2c249b20b87b4978).\n\nI've logged this as a high-priority issue in JIRA PAY-1705.\n\n**Action Items for ICICI Team:**\n\n1.  Could you please urgently investigate the payment routing configuration for MCCs 5815 and 5816 on your `/v2/payments/initiateCrossBorder` endpoint?\n2.  We require an RCA and a firm ETA for the fix by EOD today. We're getting a little nervous about the approaching go-live deadline, and data integrity is paramount.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the error rates on our Grafana dashboard (ICICI-CrossBorder-Errors).

Building on your findings in email e5e595dacb7f4711, it's clear the UPI payment reconciliation issue with ICICI Bank requires immediate escalation.\n\nThe core problem, as you highlighted, is a persistent ~0.15% mismatch between transactions we confirm as successful via the NPCI gateway and what appears in ICICI's T+1 settlement file. While this percentage seems low, at our current volume of ~15K TPS during peak hours, this translates to a significant number of unreconciled transactions daily. This directly impacts our financial reporting and puts us at risk of non-compliance with the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring Mandate.\n\nI’ve reviewed the Kibana logs you shared. We're consistently seeing successful `TXN_SUCCESS` statuses for `upi_txn_id`s that are then absent from the settlement reports. The fact that we are not receiving any specific error codes from ICICI’s API endpoints makes this particularly challenging to debug from our end. This issue is tracked under JIRA PAY-5064.\n\nThis reconciliation gap is a critical blocker for Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3. The manual effort required for reconciliation is unsustainable, and the financial float is becoming a point of concern for the finance team. We need to get to the bottom of this with ICICI Bank urgently.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Rohit Sharma (Me):** I will schedule a high-priority technical call with our counterparts at ICICI Bank, including their technical lead and product manager, for tomorrow EOD. I will frame this as a joint debugging session, referencing the file format specifications in doc#cf3e39fff3dc4c62.\n\n2.  **Aditya Singh (You):** Please prepare a consolidated CSV with a sample of at least 100 mismatched `upi_txn_id`s from the last 24-48 hours, including our internal transaction timestamps and the corresponding NPCI reference numbers. This will be crucial evidence for the call.\n\nWe need to push ICICI to investigate why these successful transactions are being dropped from their settlement generation process. My hypothesis is that there might be an issue in their internal data pipeline between their transaction processing system and the system that generates the settlement files. Let’s get their confirmation.\n\nI’ll share the meeting invite shortly.

Building on the initial alert from your analysis in email 08938d0f6b3d4f87, I've completed the initial investigation into the spike in cross-border transaction failures with ICICI Bank.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\nI can confirm the issue is isolated to our cross-border payment routing for ICICI, specifically for transactions originating from non-INR currencies. We're seeing an error rate spike to approximately 4.5% on this transaction subset, a significant deviation from our baseline of <0.2%. Our primary Grafana dashboard for international payments shows a clear correlation between the deployment for Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3 and the start of the error surge.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n\nAfter analyzing the Kibana logs (KQL query attached to JIRA PAY-7350), the root cause appears to be a misconfiguration in our payment router's k8s deployment manifest for the `icici-prod` cluster. A specific rule, intended to enrich transactions with RBI-mandated metadata, is incorrectly classifying certain international transactions (based on a set of Merchant Category Codes) as domestic. \n\nThis causes our system to generate a payload without the required FEMA declaration fields and `purpose_code`. Consequently, ICICI's Cross-Border Payments API is rejecting these requests. The frustrating part is that their API is returning a generic `Error Code: 51 - Invalid Account`, which sent us down the wrong path initially. I had to run a few manual cURL requests against their UAT endpoint to replicate the failure and get a more descriptive `Invalid_Transaction_Type` error, which finally pointed to the missing cross-border fields.\n\nThe impacted pod configuration is handling roughly 1,200 TPS at peak, and the failed transactions are showing increased p99 latency of up to 1.8s due to retry attempts before final failure.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Hotfix Prepared:** I have corrected the MCC-to-country-code mapping in the configuration file (`router-config-v2.2.yaml`, an update to the version in file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62). This has been tested and validated on our staging environment, where the error rate immediately dropped to zero and latency returned to the expected ~250ms.\n\n2.  **Emergency Deployment:** I am initiating an emergency deployment to production. Given the direct impact on revenue and the critical nature of the RBI mandate compliance, I believe this warrants bypassing the standard change window. All rollback procedures are in place.\n\n3.  **Request for Approval:** Priya, could you please provide the formal approval for this emergency push? I've already created the change request in our system.\n\n4.  **Post-Deployment Monitoring:** Once deployed, I will monitor the relevant Grafana dashboards and Kibana logs for the next two hours to ensure stability and verify that ICICI is receiving the correct payload structure. I'll also coordinate with the SRE on-call for heightened awareness.\n\nI am aiming to have this fully resolved within the next 60 minutes, pending approval.

Your analysis of the performance bottleneck is spot on and matches what I'm seeing from the compliance monitoring and system performance side.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards confirm that p99 latency for ICICI’s new transaction validation endpoint is consistently hitting 2.2s - 2.5s during our staging environment load tests. This is causing cascading failures, with our error rate for ICICI-bound traffic spiking to 2.1%, predominantly from `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors. Digging into the Kibana logs, our internal processing on the Juspay payment gateway, from request ingress to the external call, remains stable under 60ms. The entire latency delta is on the ICICI side post-handshake. Our Kubernetes pods are scaling correctly in response to the transaction queue, but the threads are getting blocked waiting for API responses, which confirms the issue isn't on our infrastructure.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is a critical blocker. The RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate requires us to perform near-real-time risk scoring and disposition, which is predicated on a sub-500ms roundtrip time. At current performance levels, we are fundamentally unable to meet this regulatory requirement, putting our go-live date in jeopardy.

I’ve spent the morning investigating the latency spike in our real-time risk scoring engine for the ICICI Bank integration, and the situation is a bit more concerning than I initially thought.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show that during the peak traffic window yesterday (approx. 16:30-18:00 IST), the P99 latency for transactions routed through the new RBI mandate flow hit 1.2s, a significant jump from our baseline of ~180ms. This directly impacted our overall transaction processing time, pushing it dangerously close to our 2s SLA. The error rate didn't spike, but that’s likely because our internal timeouts are configured just above this threshold – we were lucky to avoid widespread failures.\n\nI’ve analyzed the Kibana logs for the corresponding trace IDs, and our internal service latency appears to be nominal. The Kubernetes pods for the scoring engine scaled correctly, and resource utilization was well within our defined limits. The bottleneck seems to be external. Specifically, the response times from ICICI’s `/v2/risk/evaluate` endpoint are the primary contributor to this delay. Our logs show that the Time to First Byte (TTFB) from their servers increased from an average of 150ms to over 950ms during this period. This seems to be the root cause.\n\nThis level of performance degradation is not sustainable for meeting the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring Mandate requirements at scale.

Building on your observations, I've spent the morning digging into our monitoring and logs, and the findings are quite concerning.\n\nMy analysis strongly indicates a critical performance bottleneck originating from ICICI's side, specifically tied to their new core banking system endpoint for the RBI mandate. Here are the specifics:\n\n*   **Latency Spikes:** Our `ICICI-UAT-Performance` Grafana dashboard shows the p99 latency for their `/v2/transactions/monitor` API call spiking to over 2200ms once our load test ramps up beyond 500 TPS. Our baseline for similar synchronous calls with other partners is consistently sub-500ms. The OAuth 2.0 JWT handshake and our internal request preparation remain healthy, with latencies well under 50ms.\n\n*   **High Error Rate:** Correlating with the latency, our Kibana logs show a flood of `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` and `HTTP 503 Service Unavailable` responses from this endpoint. The error rate jumps from a nominal 0.1% to over 5% during these load periods.\n\n*   **Root Cause Hypothesis:** The issue seems isolated to their new monitoring service. The timing suggests their backend, likely connected to a legacy core system, cannot handle the concurrent request volume required for real-time transaction monitoring as per the RBI guidelines. The load we are generating in UAT is a conservative fraction of our production peak traffic, which is a major red flag.\n\nThis effectively blocks our performance validation for Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3. If this behavior translates to production, we're looking at a direct impact on our transaction success rate and a failure to meet our 99.95% uptime SLA with customers. The current state is simply not production-ready.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Escalation to ICICI:** We need to formally escalate this to our technical counterparts at ICICI. I have compiled a detailed report (attached as `file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62`, also referenced in email `2c249b20b87b4978`) with log excerpts, trace IDs, and Grafana snapshots.

The latency spikes you highlighted are concerning, but I need to flag a more critical compliance issue tied to the multi-currency settlement process which is central to Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, our current T+2 settlement cycle for foreign currencies (USD, EUR, etc.) processed via ICICI's Vostro accounts presents a significant risk under the new RBI mandate. The regulation demands near real-time transaction traceability, and our current reconciliation mismatch rate of ~1.2% for these transactions is well above our internal 0.5% threshold. Our Grafana settlement-monitoring dashboard is consistently showing alerts on this, which will be a major red flag in our upcoming audit cycle.\n\nThe root cause appears to be the lack of a real-time forex conversion rate and a unified transaction identifier in the settlement files we receive from ICICI's `ICICI-ForexSettle-v2.1` endpoint. Our `ReconEngine` is struggling to automatically match these against our internal `txn_id`, forcing manual intervention that is neither scalable nor compliant. This was a risk we flagged early on, as noted in the initial discussion thread (ref: email#2c249b20b87b4978).\n\nTo be fully compliant, we need to push ICICI Bank to provide an API that delivers the final settlement amount in INR along with the applied FX rate and our original `txn_id` in the same settlement record, ideally moving us closer to a T+1 cycle. This is not just an optimization; it's a hard requirement to ensure our audit logs are complete and defensible under the new RBI framework, which also impacts our SOC 2 reporting.\n\nI've updated JIRA ticket PAY-9268 with these compliance specifications. Could your team please perform a technical feasibility analysis on what it would take to integrate a new or enhanced API from ICICI for this purpose? I'm frankly getting a bit anxious about the upcoming Q3 deadline. I will be drafting a formal communication to our relationship manager at ICICI this week, referencing our MSA and the points from the spec doc (file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62), but it will be much stronger with your team's technical assessment.\n\nLet's sync up tomorrow to discuss a concrete plan.\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":1757914620000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@juspay.in","neha.kapoor@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on that, our engineering team has completed a deeper analysis of the performance degradation we're seeing in UAT for the RBI mandate implementation (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nDuring our load tests yesterday between 14:00 and 16:00 IST, we simulated a peak load of 8,000 TPS. While our internal UPI gateway and transaction processing systems maintained a P99 latency of <150ms, the round-trip time for calls to your new Transaction Enrichment API (`/v2/enrichTransaction`) is a critical bottleneck. \n\nOur Grafana dashboards show the P99 latency for this specific endpoint spiking to over 2.5 seconds, with an error rate of 4.5% consisting almost entirely of `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` responses. This is well outside the 400ms SLA we agreed upon in the technical specifications document (`file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62`).\n\nKibana logs confirm the delay is occurring after our request is sent while we await a response from your servers. Our Kubernetes pod autoscaling is functioning correctly, and we are not hitting any internal resource or connection pool limits, which strongly indicates the bottleneck is within the migrated ICICI core banking system.\n\nThis level of latency is frankly untenable for a production environment and presents a significant blocker. It not only risks violating our customer-facing uptime SLAs but also poses a direct compliance risk if we cannot enrich transactions in real-time as per the RBI mandate. The issue is being tracked internally via JIRA ticket PAY-9361.\n\nTo resolve this urgently, we need the ICICI team to:\n\n1.  **Investigate the performance of the underlying core banking services** supporting the `/v2/enrichTransaction` endpoint. Is there a database contention issue or a downstream service dependency that's timing out under load?\n2.  **Provide us with correlated server-side logs** for the requests made during the test window. Request trace IDs are available in our logs.\n3.  **Schedule a joint debugging session** with our engineering lead, Priya Sharma, for tomorrow to trace the request lifecycle end-to-end.\n\nGiven the tight deadline for this mandate, we need to have a clear path to resolution by EOD Friday.

Building on your email c4fcf91216374ee3, the numbers are more concerning than I initially thought, and we need to act on this immediately.\n\nA false positive rate spiking to 4.5% is simply not viable. I've been monitoring our primary Grafana dashboard for ICICI traffic, and it clearly shows our transaction success rate has dipped from our 99.2% baseline to just over 95% in the last 12 hours. This directly impacts merchant experience and puts us in a tricky position regarding our SLA commitments with the bank for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring Mandate implementation (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nYour analysis in the attached report (file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62) aligns with what the Kibana logs are showing: the new fraud model's scoring algorithm seems to be overly sensitive, especially for transactions originating from specific Tier-2 city BINs. The model's execution latency is stable at ~65ms, which is great, but the high rate of declined transactions at the pre-auth stage is the real problem. This is a significant deviation from the risk parameters we outlined in the initial project brief (ref: email#2c249b20b87b4978).\n\nI’ve updated JIRA PAY-7702 with these metrics and raised the priority to Blocker. Here’s what I propose for our immediate action plan:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Action: Priya/Aditya):** Can we urgently look into recalibrating the model's sensitivity thresholds? A hotfix that brings the false positive rate back under 1% is critical. We need to get this deployed to staging for testing by EOD tomorrow.\n2.  **Data Science (Action: to be assigned):** We need a long-term plan to retrain the model using a more nuanced dataset. The current feature set is clearly missing some patterns, leading to these incorrect flags.\n\nI need to formulate a response for our partners at ICICI Bank by Monday morning. I’d rather frame this proactively as a 'performance tuning' cycle than a critical failure. To do that, I need a confident timeline from you on when we can expect the hotfix to be in production.

Building on the initial analysis from your email (ref: 332d0c17ff8e4a22), I've traced the root cause to severe API rate limiting from ICICI Bank's UAT environment. This is becoming a critical bottleneck for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring project (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nDuring our performance runs this morning, our `payment-gateway-service` began receiving a high volume of `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` responses from ICICI's `/v2/payments/validate` endpoint. Our Grafana dashboards show that we are being throttled at approximately 80 TPS, while our target throughput for this testing phase is 250 TPS to ensure we can handle projected peak volumes under the new mandate.\n\nHere’s a summary of the impact:\n\n*   **Error Rate:** The transaction failure rate for ICICI-routed payments spiked to 4.8%, significantly breaching our internal SLO of 0.5%.\n*   **Latency:** P99 latency for the affected transactions jumped from a baseline of ~300ms to over 2.5s as our K8s pods contend with connection timeouts and retries.\n*   **System Impact:** This is cascading into downstream reconciliation jobs, which likely explains the settlement discrepancies you observed.\n\nI've attached relevant Kibana logs and dashboard snapshots to JIRA ticket PAY-4883 for a full audit trail. The current rate limit is far more restrictive than what was outlined in the technical specifications provided by ICICI (ref file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62) and a significant regression from the performance noted in earlier integration discussions (ref email#2c249b20b87b4978).\n\nTo be candid, we cannot sign off on the performance testing phase until this is resolved, which puts our Q3 compliance deadline at risk.\n\n**Immediate Actions & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Mitigation (Arjun):** I am deploying a more robust exponential backoff and jitter strategy to our client library to better handle the `429` responses and reduce immediate pressure. This will be live in staging by EOD today.\n2.  **Vendor Escalation (Priya):** Can you please raise a high-priority ticket with our technical contacts at ICICI? We need them to confirm the exact rate limits for both UAT and Production and formally process our request to increase the cap to 500 TPS to provide necessary headroom.\n3.  **Contingency (Sameer):** If we don't receive a concrete plan from ICICI within 24 hours, we may need your help to escalate this through our partnership channels.\n\nI will monitor the performance after my changes are deployed and share an update tomorrow morning.

It’s a helpful baseline.\n\nBuilding on that, I've done a deeper dive into our multi-currency settlement process, specifically how it intersects with the RBI’s new monitoring requirements under Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3. I’m concerned we have a significant compliance gap that needs to be addressed before we proceed further.\n\nCurrently, our settlement batch jobs, which run as Kubernetes cronjobs, process multi-currency transactions using a T+1 consolidated FX rate from ICICI's daily settlement file. While this reconciles from an accounting standpoint, it creates two critical issues for the enhanced monitoring mandate:\n\n1.  **Reporting Discrepancy & Risk Flagging:** The mandate requires us to report the final INR value at T+0. Our current flow introduces a variance between the indicative rate at authorization and the final settlement rate. I checked our Kibana logs for the settlement reconciliation service and found this variance averages between 0.75% and 1.5%. This is causing persistent high-priority alerts on our new Grafana risk dashboard and will almost certainly be flagged in a regulatory audit.\n\n2.  **FEMA Guideline Adherence:** The lack of a locked-in FX rate at the time of transaction is a grey area under FEMA guidelines. The legal analysis in file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62 suggests this could be interpreted as non-compliant, exposing us to risk. The core problem, as tracked in JIRA PAY-3765, is that we cannot guarantee the INR value reported to the regulator matches the final settled value.\n\nI believe we need to push ICICI for a more robust technical solution. Instead of fetching an indicative rate via their `/v1/fx/rate_query` endpoint, can we request a transaction-level FX rate lock? My proposal is to explore adding a new parameter, something like `request_rate_lock=true`, to our `/v2/payments/initiate` call. In response, their system should provide a `fx_rate_id` that is guaranteed for settlement within a T+2 window.\n\nThis `fx_rate_id` would then need to be included in their daily settlement file against each transaction. This would eliminate the rate fluctuation variance, ensuring our reporting is accurate and our audit trails are clean.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Aditya:** Can you please take this technical proposal back to your ICICI contacts? We need to confirm if their core banking system can support a transaction-level FX rate lock and if their settlement file generation process can be modified to include this new identifier. This is becoming a blocker.\n*   **Priya (Self):** I will draft a formal business requirements document (BRD) detailing this compliance requirement and technical flow, referencing this thread and the previous discussion in email 2c249b20b87b4978. I'll aim to publish it as Doc#094e608c3ec9482a by EOD tomorrow for our internal review.\n\nLet's schedule a 30-minute sync for early next week to discuss their feedback.

I've spent the morning digging into this, and the situation is more concerning than we initially thought.\n\nThe root cause is definitely the new fraud detection model we deployed for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring Mandate with ICICI Bank (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3). Our false positive rate, which typically sits around a stable 0.8%, has jumped to a sustained 4.5% over the past 48 hours. This is an unacceptable level of customer friction.\n\nLooking at our Fraud Analytics Grafana dashboard, this is translating to approximately 1,200 legitimate transactions per hour being incorrectly declined during peak volume. Beyond the immediate revenue and customer trust impact, this is also affecting system performance. The p99 latency on the primary `/payment/process` endpoint has increased from a baseline of 180ms to over 250ms, as the new model adds computational overhead. This is getting uncomfortably close to breaching our internal SLA of 300ms.\n\nI’ve analyzed the Kibana logs and correlated them with the initial pattern analysis in `file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62`. It appears the model is being overly aggressive with a combination of new metadata fields required by the mandate, specifically for first-time users making transactions in the e-commerce and gaming merchant categories. The model's feature weights for these new data points are clearly too high.\n\nFrankly, we need to get this under control immediately. A 4.5% false positive rate is untenable, and we can’t risk a full rollback given the compliance deadline and our commitments to ICICI Bank as noted in our communication thread `email#2c249b20b87b4978`.\n\nHere is the immediate action plan:\n\n1.  **Priya Sharma (Data Science):** Please prioritize retraining the model. We need a new version with a recalibrated sensitivity to these specific metadata combinations.

The log correlation was exactly what I needed for the discussion with ICICI Bank.\n\nFollowing up on that, I've escalated the UPI settlement mismatch issue we're observing on the ICICI gateway. Our automated reconciliation system flagged a discrepancy of approximately 0.12% of the total transaction value in yesterday’s T+1 settlement file, which is a significant deviation from our <0.01% baseline and is frankly becoming a bit of a headache.\n\nThe core of the problem, as your investigation highlighted, is with transactions where we receive a SUCCESS confirmation from their `/upi/v2/payment/status` endpoint, yet these transactions are conspicuously missing from the EOD settlement files. The Kibana logs you compiled in `file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62` were instrumental in demonstrating this. We are not seeing any corresponding reversal notifications or standard NPCI error codes (like `U30` or `U69`), which is making manual reconciliation extremely difficult and is a clear deviation from the T+1 settlement cycle.\n\nI just got off a call with Ankit Mehta from ICICI's technical team. I've shared our analysis, referencing our earlier communication (email#2c249b20b87b4978) and the specific transaction IDs. They suspect this could be a race condition within their internal batch processor that collates transactions for the final settlement file, potentially missing transactions that are confirmed close to the batch cut-off time.

Building on your initial analysis in email 59a227987e014dd5, I've investigated the issue impacting the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring project (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nHere’s a summary of my findings:\n\n**1. Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe problem is localized to API calls made to ICICI's `/v2/customer/ekyc_extended_validation` endpoint, specifically for customer profiles our internal risk engine flags as 'high-risk'.\n\n- **Performance Degradation:** I've confirmed via our Grafana dashboard (Payments-ICICI-Prod) that while standard KYC checks have a P99 latency of ~350ms, the latency for these high-risk profiles is spiking to between 2,000ms and 3,000ms. \n- **Timeout Errors:** Our kyc-automation-service, running in our Kubernetes cluster, has a client-side HTTP timeout configured at 2.5 seconds. The prolonged response time from ICICI's end is causing us to consistently hit this limit, resulting in a cascade of `504 Gateway Timeout` errors. This is visible in the Kibana logs under the `juspay-prod-payments` index.\n- **Error Rate Impact:** This has pushed the error rate for the kyc-automation-service from a baseline of 0.15% to over 5% during the batch processing window, which is unacceptable for our production SLAs.\n\nThe OAuth 2.0 JWT token generation and refresh cycle is operating within expected parameters, so we can definitively rule out an authentication issue.\n\n**2. Compliance & Business Impact:**\nThis is a critical blocker. The compliance requirements detailed in Doc#cf3e39fff3dc4c62 mandate a 99.5% success rate for all KYC verifications before we can fully onboard merchants under the new mandate. At the current failure rate, we are non-compliant and cannot proceed with the planned go-live.\n\nI have attached detailed log excerpts and a snapshot from the Grafana dashboard to the corresponding JIRA ticket, PAY-4390, for a complete audit trail.\n\n**Proposed Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n**1. Immediate Mitigation (Internal):**\nAs a temporary workaround, I can deploy a configuration change to the staging environment that increases the HTTP client timeout for this specific endpoint to 4 seconds. This should reduce the immediate failures. However, this is a temporary measure that could potentially tie up threads in our service's connection pool, risking wider performance degradation if ICICI's latency issues persist.\n\n**2. Long-Term Solution (Requires ICICI Engagement):**\nWe need to escalate this to our technical counterparts at ICICI. The core issue is on their side. We should request that they either:\n\n   a) **Optimize Endpoint Performance:** Ensure their `/v2/customer/ekyc_extended_validation` endpoint can consistently meet a sub-2-second P99 latency SLA, even for complex validation cases. \n   b) **Implement an Asynchronous Flow:** Transition to an asynchronous callback/webhook model for these extended checks. This would be the ideal, most resilient architecture, and I recall it being mentioned as a possibility in the initial design discussions (ref: email#2c249b20b87b4978).\n\nCould you please help facilitate a high-priority technical sync with the ICICI team to address this?

The surge in `504 Gateway Timeout` errors originating from the ICICI side, as seen in the Kibana logs you shared, confirms their new system is struggling to handle the TPS. This is frankly quite worrying, given our staging environment is only pushing ~12k TPS.\n\nI've cross-referenced ICICI's API specification (file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62) and our initial discussion thread (email#2c249b20b87b4978), and there are no stated rate limits that would explain this degradation. If this isn't resolved, we face a significant risk of failing our upcoming audit and missing the compliance deadline. I've updated JIRA PAY-6514 with this risk assessment and linked it to the primary work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3.\n\nTo formalize our escalation to ICICI, could you please compile a comprehensive report? Let's include:\n1. Time-series graphs of p95/p99 latency from Grafana for the last three load tests.\n2. A summary of error rate percentages, specifically highlighting the `504` errors.\n3. Relevant log snippets from Kibana showing the request-response cycle timeouts.\n\nHaving this consolidated by EOD tomorrow would be ideal. I will use it to draft the official communication to our counterparts at ICICI. In parallel, I am initiating a contingency plan as part of our SOC 2 compliance for this project. Hopefully, we won't need it, but we must be prepared.\n\nLet me know if you need anything from my end."],"timestamp":1757916480000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

The data confirms the concerns I've been hearing from the business simulation side regarding the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate implementation with ICICI Bank.\n\nA jump in the false positive rate from our baseline of ~0.6% to the current 4.5% in the staging environment is alarming. Our Grafana dashboards for UPI transaction health show a corresponding dip in the simulated success rate to below 95%, which is simply not a viable state for a production rollout. This directly impacts our settlement reconciliation models and would create significant operational overhead.\n\nFrom what I can gather from the Kibana logs you shared, the issue seems to be concentrated in the new rule sets deployed for this mandate, especially for high-value P2M UPI transactions. It appears the model is being overly aggressive and is failing to correctly interpret legitimate transaction patterns, leading to these failures. I have a growing concern that if we can't get this under control, we risk missing our compliance deadline for Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3.\n\nI’ve already forwarded a summary of your findings, along with the context from file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62 and email#2c249b20b87b4978, to my counterparts at ICICI Bank to get their fraud analytics team involved. The issue is being tracked formally under JIRA PAY-2920.\n\nAs a next step, could your team please investigate if we can isolate the specific rules causing this spike? It would be invaluable to know if we can temporarily disable them or if we need to push ICICI for an immediate parameter tuning on their end before our next joint review. I'm trying to schedule a call with them for early next week to deep-dive into the model's behavior.\n\nLet's connect tomorrow to align on our position before that meeting.

Building on the analysis from your earlier email (b41b300d44114756), I've finished the initial investigation, and we've pinpointed the root cause.\n\nThe issue lies with ICICI Bank's API. Their new `/transaction/risk/v2` endpoint, which is a mandatory part of the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3), is aggressively rate-limiting our calls. \n\nHere’s a summary of the impact based on our Grafana metrics and Kibana logs:\n\n*   **Transaction Throughput:** Our TPS has plummeted from a healthy average of 700 to sustained troughs of ~250 TPS during peak load. This is a critical failure.\n*   **API Errors:** We are seeing a massive spike in `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` responses from their gateway. This accounts for nearly 95% of all errors originating from the ICICI integration in the last two hours.\n*   **Latency Impact:** P99 latency for this specific API call has shot up from our baseline of ~450ms to over 2.5 seconds before ultimately timing out, severely impacting user experience and increasing our overall transaction failure rate to an unacceptable 4.8%.\n\nI’ve confirmed our internal systems are not the bottleneck. Our UPI gateway's Kubernetes pods are scaling correctly in response to load, and our OAuth 2.0 authentication flow and JWT token generation are functioning within normal parameters. This is purely an external constraint.\n\nTo be frank, this is a major blocker. The current rate limit appears to be set around 300 TPS, which is completely insufficient and not in line with the projected volumes discussed and documented in the SOW (ref: file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62). We cannot meet the RBI compliance deadline with this artificial ceiling in place.\n\n**Action Taken & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  I have already initiated a high-priority support ticket with the ICICI technical team, providing them with logs and dashboard snapshots demonstrating the throttling.\n2.  I have explicitly requested an immediate increase in the rate limit for our client ID to a minimum of 1,000 TPS to provide adequate headroom for peak traffic and future growth.\n3.  I've updated JIRA PAY-2628 with all these technical findings and have linked it to the broader epic for the RBI mandate implementation.\n\nI am awaiting a response from their side. If I don't get a concrete action plan within the next two hours, I recommend we escalate this to their integration lead directly. This is putting our go-live at significant risk.\n\nWill keep you posted.\n\nRegards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757917260000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

The metrics you pulled from the ICICI-Gateway-Performance Grafana dashboard are unfortunately confirming our fears.\n\nThe `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors from ICICI's `/transaction/validate` endpoint are a major bottleneck for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring project (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3). Our Kubernetes pods are scaling correctly to handle the load, but we're hitting a hard ceiling on their end. Based on the Kibana logs, it appears they've capped us at around 250 TPS, which is causing our error rate to spike to over 4% during peak hours. This is a far cry from the 1,000+ TPS we need to support and what was implicitly agreed upon in the initial SOW (ref file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62).\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is becoming a critical issue. The RBI mandate requires real-time screening for 100% of the transaction volume in scope. These API failures mean we are not meeting that requirement, which will be a significant finding in any subsequent audit. Our audit logging system is capturing every single one of these failed API calls, creating a clear trail of non-compliance.\n\nI've already updated JIRA PAY-9810 and raised the priority. We need to treat this with urgency.\n\nCould you please set up a priority call with our technical counterparts at ICICI by EOD tomorrow? We need to get the following clarifications:\n1. A formal confirmation of their current rate limit and the rationale behind it.\n2. An immediate plan and timeline to increase the TPS limit to at least 1,200 to provide a necessary buffer for peak traffic.\n3. A revised SLA that explicitly guarantees this throughput.\n\nIn parallel, I think we should start discussing a contingency plan. What are your thoughts on implementing a circuit breaker that could temporarily reroute transactions to an alternative partner if ICICI's API error rate sustains above 1% for more than a few minutes? I know it’s a significant engineering effort, but we may need a fail-safe if they can't resolve this quickly.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nBest,\n\nPriya"],"timestamp":1757917500000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on the details from your last email (ref: 9978cfe60bc64edb), we've conducted a deeper dive on our end, and unfortunately, the issue is more significant than initially thought.\n\nThe core problem persists: we're observing a critical discrepancy between UPI transactions marked as SUCCESS in our gateway (and confirmed by NPCI) and the final entries in the T+1 settlement file your system generates. This directly impacts our reconciliation process for the RBI mandate implementation under Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3.\n\nOver the last 48 hours, our Grafana dashboard for UPI operations shows a consistent mismatch rate of ~0.8% on a daily volume of ~1.2M transactions processed via the ICICI VPA handle. This translates to over 9,600 transactions daily that are failing reconciliation. I've attached a detailed analysis in file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62 with a sample of 100 problematic `txn_id`s and their corresponding `bank_rrn`s for your immediate review.\n\nOur tech lead, Aditya, cross-referenced our Kibana logs against the settlement file. For instance, `txn_id: JPSPY509033UP12A` (NPCI Ref: `814456789012`) was confirmed as SUCCESS at 14:32 IST on May 23rd, with a successful `200 OK` response from your payment confirmation endpoint. However, this transaction is completely absent from the settlement file for that day. This isn't an isolated case; it's a pattern we're seeing across the board.\n\nOur hypothesis is a potential data synchronization issue between your transaction processing system and the service that generates the end-of-day settlement batch file. Could there be a process cutoff time misalignment or a filter that's incorrectly excluding these successfully completed transactions?\n\nAs you know, the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate requires precise and timely settlement reporting, with a near-zero error tolerance. A persistent 0.8% discrepancy is a major compliance risk that is becoming a critical bottleneck for this project's rollout. This issue has been logged under JIRA PAY-5652 for formal tracking.\n\nTo resolve this urgently, could your team please:\n\n1. Investigate the full list of `txn_id`s in the attached file (file#cf3e39fff3dc4c62) and confirm their status in your core banking system.\n2. Provide the raw transaction logs from your end for the specific `txn_id: JPSPY509033UP12A` for a side-by-side comparison.\n3. Share the technical specification for the settlement file generation logic, including data sources and any transformation rules applied.\n\nGiven the urgency, I'd like to propose a joint technical call with your engineering team tomorrow morning to debug this.

Building on that, I've spent the morning digging into the performance metrics, and the situation with the false positives on the ICICI Bank integration is becoming quite critical.\n\nThe Grafana dashboard for our UPI gateway shows our new fraud detection model is flagging transactions at a rate of 4.5% over the last 12 hours. This is dramatically above our target threshold of 0.8% and is directly causing a significant drop in payment success rates, especially for high-frequency, low-value merchants. I've linked the Kibana logs showing a surge in `Error Code: 481 - High Risk Score` in JIRA PAY-3874.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the latency of our `risk-assessment-v2` API endpoint is holding steady at a p99 of around 110ms, which is well within our SLA. The issue isn't performance but the model's logic itself. It seems overly sensitive to recurring transaction patterns, which, as per the spec in Doc#cf3e39fff3dc4c62, was a known risk we were supposed to mitigate. This is causing a poor experience for our customers and putting our relationship with ICICI Bank under stress ahead of the full mandate rollout.\n\nThis high false-positive rate is a major blocker for Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3. We cannot proceed with the production deployment until we bring this rate down. I'm already getting escalations from the business side, and we need to provide ICICI Bank with a concrete resolution plan by EOD tomorrow.\n\nHere are the immediate action items I propose:\n\n1.  **Urgent Model Tuning (Owner: Aditya/Data Science Team):** Can your team please prioritize a review of the model's feature weights for transaction velocity and history? We need to understand if a hotfix can be deployed to the staging environment for testing by 5 PM IST today.\n2.  **Vendor Communication (Owner: Rohit):** I will reach out to our technical counterparts at ICICI Bank, referencing our prior conversation (email 2c249b20b87b4978), to inform them that we are actively tuning the risk model. I will hold off on committing to a new timeline until we have a validated fix.\n3.  **Impact Analysis (Owner: Priya M.):** Priya, could you please compile a list of the top 20 merchants affected by this? We need to prepare for proactive communication.\n\nI've set up a 30-minute sync at 4:00 PM IST today to align on the path forward.

ICICI Bank has flagged a significant increase in challenged transactions, and our internal metrics confirm this.

My understanding is that this was designed to meet a specific clause in the RBI mandate, but the real-world impact is proving problematic. The goal of this meeting is to get everyone aligned on a mitigation strategy. We need to balance compliance with user experience and conversion rates.\n\nHere’s the proposed agenda: \n1. Quick review of the impacted transaction patterns (Priya). \n2. Discuss the feasibility of tuning the velocity thresholds vs. temporarily disabling the rule for specific merchant categories (Ankit). \n3. Get Vikram’s perspective from ICICI's end – what is their acceptable challenge rate, and can they provide any specific transaction IDs that were incorrectly flagged? \n4. Decide on immediate next steps. My proposal is we aim for a hotfix deployment by EOD. \n\nProposed Action Items:\n- OWNER: Ankit Verma - Prepare a configuration change to adjust the sensitivity of 'TXN-VELOCITY-V3'.

To mitigate this, we will implement an asynchronous FX rate locking mechanism. This involves creating a new microservice, 'FxLocker', which will interface with ICICI's ForexRateAPI v2.1 endpoint (`/forex/lock-rate`). Upon successful transaction authorization, our core payment processor will publish a message to a dedicated Kafka topic, `fx-rate-lock-requests`. The FxLocker service will consume from this topic, obtain a locked rate valid for 600 seconds, and persist the `fx_lock_id` and `locked_rate` into our primary PostgreSQL 'transactions' table.","This architectural change requires a schema modification to the 'transactions' table, adding `fx_lock_id` (VARCHAR(64)), `locked_fx_rate` (DECIMAL(18,8)), and `fx_lock_expiry_ts` (TIMESTAMPTZ). The nightly settlement batch job, 'SettleWise', must be modified to prioritize the `locked_fx_rate` over fetching a new rate. Any transaction where `current_timestamp > fx_lock_expiry_ts` will be flagged with a new internal error code, `SETL_ERR_409_FX_EXPIRED`, and routed to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for manual reconciliation by the finance operations team. This is expected to reduce automated settlement failures to below 0.5% and provide a clear audit trail for every cross-border transaction's currency conversion rate.","Immediate action items involve the Payments Engineering team scoping the FxLocker microservice development within the existing Spring Boot framework. A parallel task is for the DBA team to prepare and test the schema migration scripts in the UAT environment by next Tuesday. On the business development front, I will secure the production API keys and the final rate card for the ForexRateAPI v2.1 from our technical account manager at ICICI Bank.

Building on the initial findings in file 98521b0f0ea14eca, I've completed a deeper investigation into the cross-border transaction failures with ICICI bank.\n\nThe issue appears to be a direct result of a routing configuration error on their end, triggered by the new parameters we're passing for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate. Here’s a breakdown of what I found:\n\n**Technical Analysis & Impact:**\n\n*   **Root Cause:** Our `icici-pg-adapter` service is correctly sending the new `enhanced_monitoring_flag` and `transaction_risk_score` fields in the payload to ICICI's `/v2/cross-border/initiate` endpoint. However, Kibana logs show we're consistently getting a `GW-5304: Invalid Routing Parameter` error in response. This error is exclusive to non-INR transactions where the beneficiary account is with ICICI.\n*   **Performance Metrics:** The Grafana dashboard confirms this. For the affected transaction segment, our error rate spiked from a baseline of 0.3% to 4.8% between 10:30 AM and 11:15 AM IST. P99 latency for these calls degraded from ~450ms to ~2.1s before timing out, indicating a processing bottleneck on their side before the rejection.\n*   **Hypothesis:** It seems their gateway is incorrectly routing these enhanced-payload transactions through a domestic settlement flow, which then fails the currency and compliance checks, instead of the designated cross-border processing channel. This behavior wasn't documented in the API specifications they provided.\n\n**Actions Taken & Next Steps:**\n\nAs a stopgap, I have temporarily disabled the feature flag for enhanced monitoring on the staging environment to unblock parallel testing efforts. This is obviously not a long-term solution.\n\nI have documented all findings, including request/response payloads and relevant log snippets, in JIRA ticket PAY-1865. This is currently a blocker for the overall project (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nAditya, could you please help escalate this with our technical contacts at ICICI? We need them to investigate and confirm the correct configuration for their routing rules when these new RBI-mandated fields are present. It's a bit frustrating to hit this roadblock, as it suggests a gap in their UAT environment's parity with production.

Building on that, I've spent the morning digging into the PCI compliance audit findings related to our RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring implementation with ICICI Bank, and I've found something that needs our immediate attention.\n\nThe auditors have flagged a potential gap in our real-time data submission to ICICI's new `/v2/transactions/monitor` endpoint. Specifically, it relates to PCI DSS Requirement 10.2, which mandates logging of all actions and relevant metadata. Our current implementation seems to be failing to transmit the `device_fingerprint` and `user_risk_score` fields for a subset of transactions, which is a core requirement of the new RBI mandate.\n\nI’ve been cross-referencing this with our production logs. Looking at the Kibana dashboard for our UPI gateway (search query: `\"POST /v2/transactions/monitor\" AND status:422`), I'm seeing a consistent 1.2-1.5% error rate, manifesting as `HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity` responses from ICICI's side. This isn't a huge volume in the grand scheme of things, but it's a critical compliance failure for every single transaction it affects. The latency for these failed calls is low, around 180ms, indicating it's a validation failure, not a timeout.\n\nThis is a bit concerning as it directly impacts our compliance posture for Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3. The audit finding is non-negotiable, and we need to demonstrate a clear path to remediation by the end of next week. I’ve documented a more detailed analysis of the log patterns and correlated them with transaction types in file#98521b0f0ea14eca.\n\nI've created JIRA ticket PAY-6001 to formally track this issue. My initial hypothesis is either a data serialization issue for transactions originating from specific mobile OS versions or an unannounced change in ICICI's API validation rules. We need engineering to confirm the root cause.\n\nCould you please assign someone to investigate this urgently? Here are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Owner: Aditya's Team):** Analyze the request payloads for transactions resulting in a `422` error from ICICI's `/v2/transactions/monitor` endpoint. Please provide an initial RCA by EOD tomorrow.\n2.  **Compliance (Owner: Priya Nair):** I will reach out to our technical contact at ICICI Bank to inquire about any recent, undocumented changes to their API specification and share the JIRA ticket for context.\n\nWe need to get on top of this quickly to close out the audit finding without any escalations.

This affects approximately 1,200 UPI transactions processed between 14:30 and 16:00 IST. I've been poring over the data and it’s a bit frustrating that this pattern is re-emerging.\n\nCross-referencing our transaction logs in Kibana with the settlement report (file#98521b0f0ea14eca), the issue appears to stem from transactions that timed out when querying ICICI's `/v2/upi/settlement/reconciliation` endpoint. Our system recorded these as 'PENDING', but ICICI seems to have marked them as 'SUCCESS' in their final batch. The p99 latency on that endpoint spiked to over 1.8s during that window, well above the 500ms SLA, which likely triggered our internal timeout logic. The Kibana logs show a cluster of `ICICI_RECON_TIMEOUT` errors coinciding with the transaction window.\n\nThis kind of mismatch is a significant red flag for our RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate. We absolutely need to ensure our system state is a perfect mirror of the bank's before the T+1 cut-off to maintain compliance and avoid any regulatory penalties. The current process isn't robust enough for the transaction volumes we're seeing.\n\nI've logged the full technical details, including transaction IDs and log snippets, under JIRA PAY-5141. For now, my team has manually reconciled the amount to ensure our books are balanced, but this is not a scalable solution and puts us at operational risk.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Engineering (Aditya):** Could your team please prioritize an investigation into the error handling for `ICICI_RECON_TIMEOUT`? We need to explore implementing a more resilient retry mechanism with an exponential backoff. It might also be worth considering a final sweep query against their system right before our internal settlement process closes for the day.\n2.  **Operations (My Team):** We will continue monitoring the T+0 provisional files from ICICI for any similar patterns today and will manually flag any discrepancies.\n\nI am reaching out to our technical account manager at ICICI Bank to get their server-side logs for the incident window, referencing our prior conversation from email#b3a4569a0eea4730.

Building on your initial analysis in email 15f8176337054ad4, I've investigated the issue impacting the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring implementation with ICICI Bank (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe issue is a configuration error in our 'Pathfinder' payment routing service, deployed yesterday at 18:30 IST. A change in the routing logic, intended to optimize domestic transaction costs, is incorrectly classifying certain international BIN ranges as domestic. Consequently, these cross-border transactions are being sent to ICICI's domestic settlement endpoint instead of their cross-border one.\n\n**Technical Observations & Metrics:**\n*   **Kibana Logs:** Queries on the `payment-gateway-*` index show a high volume of `ERR_INVALID_CURRENCY_OR_COUNTRY` responses (Error Code: 8305) from ICICI's API for transactions with foreign BINs. These requests are being routed to `/api/v2/payments/domestic` instead of the designated `/api/v2/payments/international` endpoint.\n*   **Grafana Dashboard:** Our 'ICICI-CrossBorder-Performance' dashboard confirms this. The error rate for the ICICI gateway spiked from our baseline of 0.15% to approximately 4.8% starting around 18:35 IST. P99 latency for the affected transactions jumped from ~350ms to over 2.2s due to timeout and retry failures.\n*   **Impact:** This affects all international transactions processed via ICICI, violating the routing accuracy requirements outlined in the RBI mandate and the technical specifications in `file#98521b0f0ea14eca`. This creates a critical compliance gap for audit logging and reporting.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\nI've opened JIRA PAY-6304 to track this incident. My immediate plan is:\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation (Owner: Arjun Mehta):** I am preparing a hotfix by reverting the specific routing rules in the Kubernetes ConfigMap for the Pathfinder service. I've already tested the rollback in our staging environment, and it resolves the issue. Latency returned to ~340ms, and the error rate dropped to 0.1%.\n\n2.  **Production Deployment (Owner: Arjun Mehta, Approval: Aditya Singh):** I am ready to deploy this hotfix to production. I need your approval to proceed. I'm targeting a deployment within the next 60 minutes to minimize further business impact.\n\n3.  **Post-Mortem & Preventive Measures (Owner: Core Platform Team):** Following the fix, we need to conduct a post-mortem. I strongly suggest enhancing our CI/CD pipeline to include a dedicated test suite that simulates cross-border transactions against new routing rules before they can be merged to master. This was a preventable error.\n\nPlease let me know if you approve the production hotfix. I'll be monitoring the system closely post-deployment.\n\nRegards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757912520000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on your analysis in email 6c78faa8dde84dc4, I’ve spent the morning digging into the logs with the SRE team, and I have some concerning findings regarding the ICICI core banking system migration.\n\nThe performance bottleneck appears to be consistent and localized to ICICI's new infrastructure. Our Grafana dashboards are showing that p99 latency for the `v3/payments/validate` endpoint is now averaging between 1.8s and 2.5s during peak hours. This is a significant deviation from the sub-500ms latency we observed in their UAT environment and is well outside our internal SLA for partner bank integrations.\n\nThis latency is causing a direct impact on our transaction success rate. We're seeing a spike in `504 Gateway Timeout` errors, pushing our overall error rate for the ICICI gateway up to 1.6%, a sharp increase from our 0.2% baseline. I've attached a snapshot from Kibana (file#98521b0f0ea14eca) showing the error correlation for Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is becoming a critical issue. The RBI mandate requires near real-time transaction reporting. These timeouts mean our audit logging system is failing to capture the final status of a significant number of transactions, which will be a major finding in our next review. This directly jeopardizes our ability to meet the mandate's deadline.\n\nOur internal diagnostics confirm that our Kubernetes pods for the UPI gateway are scaling as expected and our internal network latency is nominal. The issue is definitively on the ICICI side, as we also saw in the preliminary discussion (ref email#b3a4569a0eea4730). It seems their new core banking system is not performing under our production load.\n\nHere are my proposed next steps:\n\n1.  **Immediate Escalation:** I will schedule an urgent technical call with Sameer Verma and the ICICI Bank tech leads for tomorrow morning to present these findings.\n2.  **Formal Data Request:** We need to formally request end-to-end tracing logs from their system for the failed transaction IDs logged under JIRA PAY-5610.\n3.  **Risk Mitigation:** I'm updating JIRA PAY-5610 to Blocker status and will begin documenting a risk mitigation plan, which may involve temporarily routing lower-priority traffic away from ICICI if we don't see a resolution path within 48 hours.\n\nI’m honestly getting a bit worried about the timeline here. We need a clear commitment and a fix plan from ICICI this week.

I'm writing to escalate an urgent issue that our PCI compliance audit has surfaced, which is directly tied to the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring Mandate implementation (Work ID: 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nOur auditors have flagged a critical gap in the audit trail capabilities for transactions processed via the new ICICI `risk-assessment/v2` endpoint. Specifically, for transactions that your risk engine flags as high-risk or declines, the API response payload is missing the specific rule identifiers that contributed to that score. This is a significant finding and puts us at risk with PCI DSS Requirement 10, which mandates comprehensive logging to reconstruct event timelines.\n\nI've personally verified this by analyzing our Kibana logs over the last 48 hours. While we are correctly receiving the `risk_score` parameter, the `triggered_rules` array—which we expected based on our initial discussions documented in email b3a4569a0eea4730—is consistently null or absent in the response JSON. This prevents our risk operations team from conducting manual reviews or providing auditors with the necessary evidence for declined transactions. I've created JIRA PAY-7513 to track this remediation effort on our end.\n\nFrom a performance perspective, the integration is otherwise stable. Our Grafana dashboards show p99 latency for the API call holding steady around 410ms, well within our 800ms SLA, and the error rate is negligible at 0.15%. This is purely a data payload and compliance issue, but its severity is high given the time-sensitive nature of the audit.\n\nTo achieve compliance, we require an immediate change to the API contract. The `triggered_rules` field in the response must be populated with an array of strings, where each string is the unique identifier for a risk rule that fired during the assessment. This was part of the original data enrichment scope defined in the SOW (ref: file#98521b0f0ea1eca).\n\nCould you please confirm with your development team the feasibility and timeline for deploying this change to the UAT environment? Our auditors have given us a firm remediation deadline of next Friday, so we're unfortunately under considerable pressure to get this resolved.\n\nI propose we schedule a 30-minute sync tomorrow morning with the technical leads to align on the specifics.

Building on the details you provided in your last message (email 15ff2534b7984fb7), our team has conducted a deeper investigation into the KYC automation failures we are observing for high-risk customer segments.\n\nTo be frank, I am quite concerned about this issue, as it is a critical blocker for the successful implementation of the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring Mandate (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3). Our compliance reporting depends entirely on this automation, and any delay puts our go-live date at risk.\n\nHere’s a summary of our findings:\n\nOur analysis of the Kibana logs (index: `juspay-prod-icici-gw`) confirms that we are receiving a `422 Unprocessable Entity` error specifically from your `/v2/customer/enhancedKYC` endpoint. This error is confined to the customer segment our fraud engine has flagged as 'high-risk'. While standard-risk profile checks are processing with a healthy P99 latency of ~450ms and a 99.8% success rate, the failure rate for the high-risk cohort has now spiked to an unacceptable 35%.\n\nAs we’ve documented in JIRA PAY-6789, the OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token management appear to be functioning correctly, as the authorization headers are consistent across both successful and failed calls. Our leading hypothesis is that the issue lies within the payload validation logic on your backend, particularly how it handles the additional `risk_factors` and `customer_tier` fields we pass for this segment, as outlined in the spec we finalized (ref: file#98521b0f0ea14eca).\n\nTo resolve this promptly, we have the following action items for your team:\n\n1.  **Investigate Endpoint Logic:** Can your API gateway team please perform a detailed review of the validation logic on the `/v2/customer/enhancedKYC` endpoint? Specifically, we need to know why the schema validation might be failing for payloads with the high-risk parameters.\n\n2.  **Correlate Server Logs:** Could you please provide us with the server-side application logs corresponding to the `trace-id` values we have already shared in the JIRA ticket? This will be crucial for us to map the error to a specific service on your end.\n\nGiven the tight deadline, I propose we schedule a 30-minute technical sync-up call tomorrow with our engineering lead, Priya Nair, and the relevant engineers from your side.

Unfortunately, the situation is more concerning than we initially suspected and is now a critical blocker.\n\nOur Grafana dashboard (payments-latency-icici-staging) shows that while our internal processing within the Juspay VPC remains stable at ~50ms, the end-to-end p99 latency for calls to ICICI's new `/v2/transaction/risk_score` endpoint is spiking to over 2.5 seconds. This is a significant deviation from the sub-400ms latency specified in the SOW (referenced in our planning Doc#67d36693c5f04282) and confirmed in email b3a4569a0eea4730.\n\nWe are also seeing a corresponding increase in `504 Gateway Timeout` errors, with the rate climbing from a baseline of 0.1% to nearly 4.5% during our load tests at just 10k TPS. This makes it impossible to validate performance against the mandate's target of handling our peak 100k TPS volume.\n\nHere’s a summary of my investigation:\n\n1.  **Internal Infrastructure:** I've confirmed our Kubernetes deployments are auto-scaling correctly, and pods are not hitting any CPU or memory limits. Network latency within our cluster is nominal.\n2.  **Log Analysis:** A review of our Kibana logs clearly shows the delay is external. Our system sends the request payload, and we then wait, on average, 2.4 seconds for a response from the ICICI gateway. The OAuth 2.0 JWT token exchange is also happening within expected timeframes (~80ms), so the bottleneck is isolated to the transaction enrichment call itself following a successful handshake.\n3.  **Root Cause Hypothesis:** All evidence points towards a performance issue on ICICI's end, likely related to their newly migrated core banking system which backs this API endpoint.\n\nThis latency directly jeopardizes our ability to meet the RBI mandate's requirement for real-time fraud scoring. At this level, we risk widespread transaction timeouts in production, impacting our SLA of 99.95% and creating a poor customer experience. I have consolidated all relevant logs and metrics in JIRA ticket PAY-1333 for tracking.\n\nCould we please formally request the ICICI team to investigate performance on their end? We suspect there might be an issue with database query optimization or resource allocation on their new infrastructure. A trace from their side would be immensely helpful.\n\nGiven the looming compliance deadline, we need to resolve this with some urgency. I'd like to propose a joint debugging call with their technical team for tomorrow EOD to review their logs in parallel with ours.

I need to bring an urgent matter to your attention that impacts our ongoing integration for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate (Work ID: 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nOur quarterly PCI DSS audit concluded yesterday, and it has flagged a critical finding related to our internal logging mechanisms. The issue, tracked under JIRA PAY-3401, pertains to the temporary logging of unmasked PAN data within our UPI gateway's transaction processing service before the data is streamed to downstream systems. While this data is not exposed externally and our production environment remains secure, the logging practice itself is in non-conformance with PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 (Masking PAN when displayed).\n\nThis has a direct, albeit manageable, impact on our project. The data feed intended for ICICI's `/v2/transactions/monitor` endpoint originates from this processing flow. To resolve the audit finding, our engineering team will be deploying a hotfix. The fix involves modifying the Log4j2 configuration in our Kubernetes pods to apply a masking filter at the point of log generation, ensuring no sensitive data is ever written to disk or our Kibana log streams unencrypted. The analysis in email b3a4569a0eea4730 confirms this is the only point of non-compliance.\n\nHere is what this means for our integration:\n\n1.  **Technical Change:** We will be changing the format of the PAN within the data payload we send to you. The current format will be replaced with a standard masked format (e.g., '454550XXXXXX1234'). This change will be compliant with the guidelines we discussed, as documented in file#98521b0f0ea14eca.\n2.  **No Performance Impact:** We've tested this change in our staging environment. There is no measurable impact on performance. P99 latency remains stable at ~210ms, and our system can still handle well over our current peak of 35,000 TPS.\n3.  **Timeline Urgency:** Due to the nature of the audit finding, we must deploy this fix to production by EOD Friday. This is a hard deadline from our CISO.\n\n**Action Item for ICICI Bank:**\nCould your technical team please confirm that your ingestion logic at the `/v2/transactions/monitor` endpoint will not reject transactions due to this format change? We need to ensure your schema validation is flexible enough to handle the masked PAN. A quick confirmation by tomorrow, EOD, would be extremely helpful.\n\nThis has unfortunately become our highest priority. We need to demonstrate remediation to the auditors by early next week. Happy to jump on a quick call if you or your team need to discuss the specifics of the implementation.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":1757915340000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","rohan.sharma@icicibank.com"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.sharma@icicibank.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"]}},

Building on your initial analysis in email 774fa2222db14362, I've spent the morning digging into the logs and I'm fairly certain the root cause is an issue with the OAuth token refresh flow with ICICI Bank.\n\nOur `icici-integration-service` is intermittently failing to refresh the access token via their `/v1/oauth/token` endpoint. The Kibana logs for the service's Kubernetes pods show a recurring pattern of `TokenExpiredException`, followed by multiple failed refresh attempts that eventually time out. This is causing a cascade of `401 Unauthorized` errors when we subsequently try to post data to their transaction monitoring API.\n\nThe impact is quite significant. Our Grafana dashboard for 'ICICI Bank API Health' shows P99 latency for the `/submitTransaction` endpoint has jumped from a baseline of ~300ms to over 2.5s during these failure windows. The overall error rate for this integration has climbed to 4.2% in the last three hours, which is well above our 0.5% SLA threshold.\n\nFrankly, I'm getting concerned. This isn't just a performance degradation; it poses a direct risk to our compliance with the RBI mandate. Every failed API call is a transaction that isn't being reported in near real-time, which could become a serious audit finding. This is the primary blocker for completing Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3.\n\nI've updated JIRA PAY-2289 with the full technical details, including trace IDs and log snippets. I’ve also escalated this to our technical account manager at ICICI, referencing our previous discussion on API stability (email b3a4569a0eea4730) and attached our internal analysis (file#98521b0f0ea14eca) to give them the necessary context. \n\nIn the meantime, could you and the SRE team explore a potential mitigation? Perhaps we can implement a more robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff specifically for the token refresh endpoint, or even a more aggressive caching strategy for the JWT token to reduce the frequency of refresh calls. Let me know what you think is feasible.\n\nI'll keep you posted on any updates from the ICICI team.

Your breakdown in email d24ee761e51043d8 helped rule out several internal factors, which is a great start.\n\nI’ve reviewed the Grafana dashboards and the situation is more concerning than I initially thought. The p99 latency for our Hyperion risk scoring engine, specifically for transactions routed through ICICI's new API endpoint, spiked to over 850ms between 14:00 and 16:30 IST yesterday. This is a significant deviation from our baseline of ~150ms and is causing a noticeable increase in transaction timeouts, with the error rate climbing by 0.75% for that specific payment flow.\n\nBuilding on your findings, I took a look at the aggregated Kibana logs for the corresponding trace IDs. The logs confirm that our internal processing, including the JWT token generation and pre-processing steps, are consistently completing within 50ms. The delay is occurring post-API call to ICICI's '/transaction-risk-assessment' endpoint. The full analysis summary is attached as file#98521b0f0ea14eca for everyone's reference.\n\nFrom a business and compliance standpoint, this is critical. These latencies put us dangerously close to breaching the overall transaction time limits and jeopardize our ability to meet the RBI's Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate deadline for Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3. We can't go live with this level of performance degradation.\n\nI've updated the core issue in JIRA PAY-3366 with these new data points.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Priya:** Could you and your team please package a concise incident report? It should include the Grafana snapshots showing the latency spike, a summary of the Kibana log analysis, and confirmation that our Kubernetes pods and downstream systems were operating within normal parameters. This will be crucial for our discussion with ICICI.\n\n2.  **Aditya:** Let's sync up this afternoon. As discussed in our earlier chat (email#b3a4569a0eea4730), we need a clear communication plan. I need to go to the ICICI integration team with unambiguous data that points to a potential bottleneck on their side. Having your product perspective will be key to framing this correctly.\n\nI will take the lead on the formal communication with Ravi Kapoor's team at ICICI. My goal is to get this on their radar with the highest priority by EOD tomorrow. We need to understand if this was a transient issue or if there's a systemic problem with their staging environment's capacity to handle our load tests, which are currently running at a modest 10k TPS.\n\nLet's get this resolved quickly.

Building on the issue you highlighted in email 33aa871b58524080 regarding the excessive false positives, I’ve done a deeper infrastructure and log-level analysis for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring implementation (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nHere’s a summary of my findings:\n\n**1. Metric Analysis:**\nOur primary Grafana dashboard for the staging environment shows a significant spike in transaction declines with the error code `FRD-05` (High-Risk Profile). The decline rate jumped from a baseline of 0.2% to an alarming 4.6% since the new fraud model was deployed via our CI/CD pipeline yesterday at 15:00 IST. This directly impacts our ability to maintain the 99.9% uptime SLA required for this integration.\n\n**2. Log Investigation (Kibana):**\nI've analyzed the logs from our Kubernetes pods running the fraud detection service. A sample of 500 transactions flagged by the model reveals that approximately 92% of them appear to be legitimate. Many are low-value UPI payments (< ₹1000) to established, high-volume merchants. The risk scoring API is consistently returning high scores for transactions that seem to lack one or two non-essential parameters, which seems overly sensitive. All details and log snippets have been attached to JIRA ticket PAY-8181.\n\n**3. API Performance:**\nThe pre-auth risk evaluation endpoint is performing well within its latency budget. The P99 latency is stable at ~180ms, well below our 400ms threshold. This confirms the issue is not with infrastructure performance but rather with the model's logic and configuration.\n\n**Root Cause Hypothesis:**\nMy assessment is that the risk-scoring thresholds in the new model are calibrated too aggressively to meet the RBI mandate, as outlined in the initial spec (related doc file#98521b0f0ea14eca). It seems to be heavily penalizing transactions without a fully-enriched data profile, which is leading to this high rate of false positives and is not sustainable for production traffic.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n*   **Priya Sharma (Security Team):** Could your team please review the model’s rule configuration and scoring thresholds? We may need to create a more nuanced ruleset that weighs risk factors differently, especially for trusted user/merchant profiles. We should probably schedule a call with the ICICI Bank technical team to clarify their interpretation of the mandate's requirements.\n*   **Arjun Mehta (Self):** I have prepared a rollback manifest for the Kubernetes deployment. We can revert to the previous stable model version in under 5 minutes if needed. I am also setting up a dedicated Grafana dashboard to monitor the specific rules firing within the new model to provide more granular data.\n\nThis high false positive rate is a critical blocker for our UAT sign-off with ICICI Bank. We need to address the model's calibration urgently.

Building on your analysis in email 22f12be539a84ac7, I've conducted a deeper investigation into the ICICI UPI settlement mismatch, and the findings are concerning from a compliance standpoint.\n\nThis issue is a critical blocker for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring Mandate implementation (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3). The discrepancy between ICICI's T+1 settlement report (file#98521b0f0ea14eca) and our internal transaction logs is not just a financial reconciliation problem—it directly compromises the integrity of the data we are mandated to monitor and report.\n\nHere's what I've found:\n\n1.  **Scope of Discrepancy:** The mismatch is affecting approximately 0.15% of the transaction volume processed via the ICICI UPI gateway over the last 48 hours. While the error rate seems low, it represents a significant number of transactions given our scale (~85K TPS at peak) and creates a direct violation of our data accuracy requirements for the RBI.\n\n2.  **Root Cause Analysis:** After reviewing the Kibana logs for our `upi-reconciliation-service`, the pattern appears isolated to transactions that initially returned a `U30` (Invalid MPIN) or similar user-side failure code from NPCI, but were subsequently retried successfully by the user within the same session. ICICI's settlement file seems to be dropping the final successful transaction leg in these specific retry scenarios, causing our system to flag them as orphans.\n\n3.  **System Impact:** Our Grafana dashboard for the settlement processor shows a sustained spike in 'unreconciled_transactions' that correlates directly with the ICICI settlement batches. This confirms the issue is systematic and not just a one-off data corruption. The logs clearly show failed lookups for the final successful `transaction_id` against the provided settlement data.\n\nThis is a major red flag for our audit trail. Inaccurate settlement data means our fraud detection models and regulatory reports will be based on an incomplete picture, which is unacceptable under the new mandate.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n*   I have created JIRA ticket **PAY-9025** to track this issue and have attached detailed logs for about 50 sample transaction IDs that exhibit this behavior. The full analysis is documented in Doc#4b0a72e2b1494a44.\n*   **To the Payments Engineering team:** Could you please prioritize an investigation into our ingestion logic for the ICICI settlement API?

The lack of a unique identifier linking the initial failure and subsequent success in their report is a potential API gap.\n\nWe urgently need a path to resolution. Let's set up a 30-minute call later today with the relevant engineers to align on a strategy.

Our primary Grafana dashboard confirms that p99 latency for the ICICI `/v2/scoreTransaction` endpoint jumped from our baseline of ~150ms to a sustained peak of over 800ms for about 20 minutes.

The latency, which was stable at ~220ms, is now fluctuating between 1.5s and 2.2s during peak hours (~30K TPS). This is well outside the sub-500ms SLA we agreed upon in our initial discussions (ref: email#b3a4569a0eea4730).\n\n2.  **Error Correlation:** We are seeing a corresponding increase in transaction timeouts on our end, with our API gateway logging `504 Gateway Timeout` errors. The error rate has climbed from a baseline of 0.1% to 0.7%, which is becoming alarming.\n\n3.  **Point of Latency:** After tracing the requests, the bottleneck appears to be the response time from your `/risk/v2/evaluate` endpoint. Our internal network latency between our Kubernetes cluster and your API gateway remains stable at ~18ms. The JWT token generation and authentication handshake are also performing within expected limits (<50ms). The delay is happening post-request, during the processing on ICICI's side.\n\nWe've ruled out resource contention on our end; our pod autoscaling is functioning correctly, and there are no CPU/memory pressures. This points towards a processing delay within your risk-scoring service.

Building on your initial analysis from email f85d9fb382da44d9, I've completed my investigation into the issue as part of Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\nThe issue is isolated to cross-border payments being routed through ICICI Bank. Our primary Grafana dashboard confirms that the error rate for this specific flow jumped from our baseline of ~0.2% to a concerning 4.5% starting around 03:00 AM IST today. This is directly tied to JIRA PAY-5769.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n\nAfter deep-diving into the Kibana logs for our `crossborder-payment-processor` service, I'm consistently seeing a `ERR_CB_703: Invalid Merchant Category Code for Cross-Border Txn` response from ICICI's `/payment/initiate/v2` endpoint. The problem appears to stem from our recent deployment intended to meet the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring Mandate.\n\nIt seems that for certain international retail merchant categories, the `beneficiary_country` field in the payload is being populated as null. This is a direct violation of the updated API specification provided by ICICI (ref: file#98521b0f0ea14eca). Our OAuth 2.0 flow and the JWT token management for API authentication remain stable; this is purely a payload data issue.\n\n**Impact:**\n\nCurrently, this is causing all USD-denominated transactions for the affected MCCs to fail. P99 latency for this transaction subset has also spiked to ~2.1s (up from our usual ~450ms) as our system attempts retries before timing out. The compliance audit logs are correctly flagging these as failed transactions, but the volume is becoming a problem.\n\n**Action Plan & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation:** I've configured a temporary routing rule in our Kubernetes config map to divert traffic for the affected MCCs to our alternate cross-border gateway. This will immediately halt the failures and bring the error rate back to baseline. I need a quick approval from the on-call SRE to apply this to production. This is a low-risk change that only affects routing logic.\n\n2.  **Permanent Fix (JIRA PAY-5769):** The payments dev team needs to release a patch that correctly populates the `beneficiary_country` field from the merchant's profile data. This will need to go through our standard CI/CD pipeline, including rigorous testing in the staging environment to ensure we don't cause any regressions. I'm hoping we can get this deployed by EOD tomorrow.\n\n3.  **Vendor Coordination:** As discussed in our earlier thread (email#b3a4569a0eea4730), proactive communication is key. I recommend we reach out to our technical contact at ICICI to provide a heads-up and confirm our diagnosis from their end. Getting their server-side logs would be invaluable for a complete post-mortem.\n\nI will keep JIRA PAY-5769 updated with all progress. Please let me know if there are any objections to the immediate mitigation plan.\n\nThanks,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer"],"timestamp":1757916720000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.sharma@juspay.in","payments-dev-team@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

The discrepancy between our internal transaction ledger and ICICI's settlement file, as highlighted in `file#98521b0f0ea14eca`, poses a direct risk to our data integrity and regulatory reporting accuracy.\n\nYesterday's reconciliation cycle flagged a mismatch for about 0.15% of the total UPI volume routed through ICICI, affecting roughly 1,250 transactions. Our Kibana logs confirm that our system recorded these transactions as `SUCCESS` based on the initial NPCI response. However, ICICI’s settlement MIS marks them as `TIMED_OUT` or `REVERSED`. This suggests we are missing the final asynchronous status update from the NPCI gateway in these specific cases, which is a major compliance gap.\n\nThis has significant implications for our audit trail under the new RBI framework. Our system of record must be unimpeachable. I have documented these findings and the potential compliance exposure in JIRA PAY-5540.\n\nCould your team please investigate the webhook processor that ingests the final NPCI status? I suspect there might be a tight timeout configuration or a resource contention issue within the Kubernetes pod during peak load (around 20K TPS) that prevents it from processing the callback, causing it to fall back to the initial 'success' state. The average latency for these callbacks should be under 250ms, but our Grafana dashboards show occasional spikes up to 1.5s for that specific service.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Aditya):** Please prioritize a deep dive into the callback handler logs for the affected transaction IDs. We need to confirm if our service is correctly acknowledging the callbacks from NPCI. An ETA on this analysis would be helpful.\n2.  **Compliance (Priya):** I will draft a formal communication to the ICICI Bank technical team to understand their exact cutoff logic for settlement file generation and to flag these specific discrepancies. I will hold off on sending it until we have your log analysis to back it up.\n3.  **Settlements Team:** Please begin quantifying the financial impact and hold off on finalizing yesterday's settlement until we have clarity.\n\nI will schedule a 30-minute sync for tomorrow morning to align on a path to resolution. We need to close this loop quickly before it impacts our T+1 settlement timeline and draws regulatory scrutiny.\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":1757916900000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","rohan.mehra@juspay.in","finance.settlements@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on your initial findings in email 5a2e3edda8b1430f, I’ve spent the morning digging into the performance data from our staging environment tests for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate with ICICI Bank.\n\nThe results are quite concerning. During our load test yesterday at 3 PM IST, we pushed a sustained 500 TPS to their `/transactions/monitor` endpoint. The p99 latency consistently hovered around 2.1s, with spikes up to 2.5s. This is significantly over the 800ms SLA target we established in the initial technical spec (ref: file#98521b0f0ea1e ca). Our Grafana dashboards clearly show the time-to-first-byte from ICICI's side is the sole contributor to this delay; our internal processing remains stable at ~60ms.\n\nAs suspected, this bottleneck appears directly related to their core banking system migration. The initial OAuth 2.0 JWT token generation is performing as expected (sub-200ms), but the subsequent API call to their new core system is where the process grinds to a halt. This level of latency is untenable for production, as it will inevitably lead to timeouts in our UPI payment flow and could jeopardize our compliance with the real-time monitoring aspect of the mandate. The risk of transaction drops and reconciliation failures is just too high.\n\nI’ve created JIRA PAY-9022 to track this issue formally and have attached the Kibana log exports and relevant dashboard snapshots. We need to get ahead of this immediately.\n\nHere are the action items:\n\n1.  **Ravi:** Could you please have the SRE team prepare a formal incident report detailing the latency breakdown? We need to present ICICI with clear data showing the issue originates within their infrastructure. Let's have this by EOD tomorrow.\n2.  **Escalation:** I will draft a formal communication to the ICICI technical team and schedule an urgent call. We need to understand if this is a temporary issue with their staging environment's provisioning or a fundamental architectural problem. This was a key point of discussion referenced in email#b3a4569a0eea4730.\n\nThis is currently the biggest blocker for Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3, and it puts our delivery timeline at risk.

I've reviewed your analysis from email b3dd43bdbc7445c3, and the UPI settlement mismatch with ICICI is indeed alarming. A discrepancy of this nature, even if it's hovering around 0.45%, is unacceptable and puts us in a difficult position for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring Mandate implementation (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nI’ve escalated this with our primary contact at ICICI Bank, referencing the agreed-upon data formats in file#98521b0f0ea14eca. The core issue seems to be with their T+1 settlement file generation process following their last system patch. Our internal reconciliation service is failing to map their `pg_txn_id` to our `order_id` for a specific subset of transactions processed between 23:00 and 01:00 IST.\n\nThe Grafana dashboard for our UPI gateway shows our transaction success rate was stable at 99.7% during that window, and API latencies for the `/payment/process` endpoint were nominal at ~180ms p99. The issue is purely post-facto, in the settlement reporting. Our Kibana logs confirm successful transaction completions acknowledged by NPCI, which makes this reconciliation failure even more frustrating. JIRA PAY-5638 has been updated with these logs.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, we're currently holding a disputed amount that's growing with each settlement cycle. This not only affects our cash flow but also creates a significant audit trail problem that will get flagged during the next RBI review. We need to get this resolved before it breaches our internal risk thresholds.\n\nCould you please have your team prepare a detailed report with a sample of at least 100 mismatched `transactionRefId`s? I need this as concrete evidence to push the ICICI tech team for an immediate hotfix. I suspect their batch job is picking up an incorrect field or experiencing data corruption post-processing. While we wait for their RCA, can we explore a temporary solution, perhaps a script to manually reconcile these transactions based on other parameters to stop the bleeding?\n\nLet's connect at 4 PM today to go over the data before I get on a call with the ICICI product head."],"timestamp":1757917320000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh@juspay.in","priya.nair@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

I’ve reviewed the PCI audit finding you highlighted in email 11b31642ad104bf1, and it is indeed a critical gap we need to plug immediately.\n\nMy initial analysis confirms the auditor’s findings. It appears our logging configuration for the new ICICI RBI monitoring endpoint (`/v3/payments/enhanced-monitoring`) is inadvertently capturing a subset of sensitive data fields in plaintext before they are ingested by our Kibana cluster. Specifically, fields like `customerIp` and `deviceIdentifier`, which are now mandatory under the new mandate, are not being properly masked. This is a direct violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 concerning the masking of PAN and other sensitive authentication data.\n\nThis seems to be an oversight during the initial integration sprint for Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3, where our focus was on ensuring data transmission to ICICI via their required OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token structure, as detailed in file#98521b0f0ea14eca. The logging aspect for our internal monitoring was not sufficiently hardened.\n\nHere is the proposed two-phase remediation plan tracked under JIRA PAY-9672:\n\n**Phase 1: Immediate Hotfix (Target: EOD Today)**\n\n1.  **Configuration Update:** I will update the Fluentd configuration via our Kubernetes ConfigMaps to apply a masking pattern specifically to the new fields from the ICICI payload. This will ensure the data is masked at the source before it enters our Kafka pipeline.\n2.  **Deployment:** This change will be deployed to our staging environment within the next 2-3 hours for validation. The performance impact should be negligible, likely adding less than 5ms of processing overhead per transaction. Our current P99 latency for this flow is around 210ms, so this is well within acceptable limits.\n3.  **Verification:** I’ll manually verify the logs in the staging Kibana to ensure masking is effective and that no other logging functionality has been impacted.\n\n**Phase 2: Long-Term Hardening (Target: End of Next Sprint)**\n\n1.  **Code-Level Sanitization:** We will modify the payment processor service itself to perform sanitization within the application logic, rather than relying solely on the logging agent. This is a more robust, defense-in-depth approach.\n2.  **Alerting & Monitoring:** I will set up a new alert in our Prometheus/Alertmanager stack that actively scans Kibana logs for patterns matching unmasked sensitive data. This will provide an immediate notification if a similar issue ever recurs. I’ll share the link to the new Grafana dashboard once it’s ready.\n\nOur current ICICI UPI gateway is handling ~12,000 TPS at peak with a 99.95% uptime, and this change will not jeopardize those SLAs. \n\n**Action Items:**\n*   **Arjun (Me):** Deploy hotfix to staging environment by 6 PM IST today.\n*   **Aditya (You):** Could you please arrange for the QA team to run a priority regression test on the payment flow in staging once I confirm the deployment? A confirmation by tomorrow 11 AM IST would be ideal.\n\nPending successful QA, we can get this pushed to production in tomorrow night’s maintenance window. This is a bit of a scramble, but it's completely manageable.

Building on your analysis in email 540a73ac839c4d52, I’ve investigated the KYC automation failures for high-risk customer segments within the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring project (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nThe issue is more specific than we initially thought. The failures are isolated to requests sent to ICICI Bank’s `/v2/customer/enhanced-kyc-check` endpoint for users our internal risk engine has flagged with a score above 0.85. Our monitoring dashboard in Grafana shows a sharp increase in API errors for this specific segment, with the failure rate hitting 14.8% over the past 48 hours, while our overall API success rate remains at 99.7%.\n\nAfter digging into the Kibana logs for the `icici-integration-service`, I’m consistently seeing `HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity` responses. The ICICI gateway is returning a custom error code `EKYC_PAYLOAD_INVALID_904` with the message “Invalid risk parameter structure.” It seems their validation logic is rejecting the nested JSON object we are passing in the `customerRiskProfile` field. According to their latest API documentation (file#98521b0f0ea14eca), they now expect a flattened key-value structure for these enhanced risk parameters, which contradicts the implementation we finalized based on our earlier discussions (ref: email#b3a4569a0eea4730).\n\nThis is a critical compliance risk. Every failure results in a fallback to manual KYC verification, creating a significant backlog and preventing us from meeting the real-time monitoring requirement stipulated by the RBI mandate. We cannot afford this manual overhead, and it's a direct threat to our project deadline.\n\nI’ve created JIRA ticket PAY-6838 to track the required fix. Here are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Aditya Singh:** Can the payments engineering team please prioritize PAY-6838? We need to implement a data transformation layer within the `icici-integration-service` to flatten the `customerRiskProfile` object before it’s sent in the API request. This will need to be deployed as a hotfix.\n\n2.  **Priya Nair (self):** I am reaching out to our technical account manager at ICICI to get formal confirmation on this unannounced schema change and to ensure there are no other breaking changes in their pipeline. This is a bit frustrating as it deviates from our agreed-upon spec.\n\nOnce the hotfix is deployed to the staging environment, I will run a full regression suite against our high-risk test user data to validate the fix and monitor the API latency to ensure it remains below our 750ms P99 threshold.\n\nWe need to resolve this by EOD tomorrow to mitigate further compliance drift.

Building on your analysis in email 4d674e5d2e5b4759, we've completed our internal review of the high false positive rates from the new fraud model in staging, and the situation is more critical than we initially thought.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards monitoring the UPI gateway are showing a sustained false positive rate of approximately 4.2% over the last 6 hours, peaking at 5.1% during high-volume periods. This is an order of magnitude higher than the 0.5% target threshold outlined in our joint implementation plan (ref: file#98521b0f0ea1e4ca). The bulk of these flags are for legitimate transactions in the INR 5,000-20,000 range.\n\nThe immediate operational impact is a significant increase in manual review queues and, more concerningly, a degradation in transaction processing performance. Our P99 latency for the `/payment/process` endpoint has spiked from a baseline of 220ms to over 1.9s for transactions routed through the new model. This is directly attributable to the synchronous call to your new risk assessment API endpoint.\n\nI’ve been digging through the Kibana logs (index: `juspay-prod-upi-txns-*`) and have isolated a pattern. Most of the rejections correspond to your `F78` error code (Suspicious Activity Flagged), as expected. However, when we cross-reference these transaction IDs with our own risk engine and user history, over 90% appear to be from established users with low-risk profiles. I’ve attached a detailed analysis with specific transaction IDs to JIRA PAY-4896. This seems to contradict the logic discussed in our earlier conversations (ref: email#b3a4569a0eea4730).\n\nOur hypothesis is that the model's feature weighting for 'transaction velocity per device ID' and 'first-time high-value transaction' is currently too aggressive for the RBI mandate's requirements, especially for our large e-commerce merchants who see significant velocity during flash sales. It seems to be penalizing legitimate user behavior.\n\nTo move forward, we need your immediate support on two fronts:\n\n1.  **Rule Engine Log Analysis:** Can your team please provide the detailed rule-engine decision logs for the sample of 50 transaction IDs I've uploaded to JIRA PAY-4896? We need to understand which specific rules or combinations are triggering the `F78` flag.\n\n2.  **Model Re-Tuning Plan:** Based on the logs, we need a concrete plan and timeline for re-tuning the model. We can't proceed with further UAT or think about production deployment for Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3 until we can get the false positive rate in staging below 1%.\n\nGiven the compliance deadline, we are in a tight spot. We need a preliminary analysis of the logs by EOD tomorrow, with a proposed tuning plan by Friday.

Based on our Slack discussions and Priya's analysis, the root cause appears to be a misconfiguration in our Payment Gateway's routing logic that incorrectly applies a 'T05 - Transaction Monitoring Timeout' status for specific merchant category codes (MCCs), instead of routing them to ICICI's new `payments/v2/crossborder/auth` endpoint as required by the RBI mandate.\n\nThe primary agenda is to align on the path-to-production for the patch. Priya has a hotfix ready for review. We need to confirm the UAT strategy and timeline with Vikram from ICICI. The Grafana dashboard (link in PAY-1423) shows the error rate for these MCCs peaked at 4.5%, impacting around 1,200 transactions before we enabled the feature flag 'ICICI-XB-V2-Route-Disable'. We need to ensure our UAT plan includes replaying these failed transaction IDs from the BigQuery logs to validate the fix comprehensively.\n\nProposed Next Steps & AIs:\n1.  **Technical Review:** Priya to walk us through the code changes in the hotfix. (15 mins)\n2.  **UAT Plan:** Vikram (ICICI) to confirm availability of their sandbox environment and validate our proposed test cases. We need to simulate transactions from UAE, SG, and US corridors specifically. (20 mins)\n3.  **Compliance Sign-off:** Sonia, can you confirm if this fix requires a re-submission of any compliance documentation to the RBI, or if it's covered under an operational change? (5 mins)\n4.  **Deployment & Rollback:** Anand to propose a deployment window for this Thursday, post-business hours. We also need a clear rollback plan, which I assume is re-enabling the feature flag. Let's confirm.

The daily discrepancy is now consistently around 0.15%, impacting our automated reconciliation for the RBI Enhanced Monitoring project. We need to isolate the root cause and define a clear path to resolution with ICICI.\n\nBased on the Slack thread and Priya's initial investigation, the issue seems to stem from transactions that receive a terminal status late or not at all from ICICI's callback system. Our BigQuery analysis on the `upi_recon_logs_prod` dataset shows a spike in 'un-reconciled' states for transactions with NPCI error codes U30 and U68. The Grafana dashboard 'UPI-Gateway-Health' confirms this pattern, with the mismatch count growing significantly after ICICI's EOD batch processing (around 11 PM IST). The total value discrepancy from yesterday's settlement file (`ICICI_SETTLE_20250610.csv`) is approx. 2.1 Cr. We need to determine if this is a webhook delivery failure on their end or a consumption issue on our side before we can proceed with the monitoring mandate's next phase.\n\nProposed Agenda & Next Steps:\n1.  **ICICI Log Review:** Vikram, can your team please pull the outbound webhook delivery logs for our endpoint (`juspay_callback_url/v3/upi/status`) for the sample transaction IDs I shared via email? We need to confirm if a 200 OK was received. **Owner: Vikram Rao (ICICI)**, **ETA: EOD Today.**\n2.  **Juspay Ingress Logging:** Priya will deploy a temporary, high-verbosity logging configuration on our side to capture all incoming payloads from ICICI's known IP ranges.

We'll use this to escalate with ICICI leadership if we don't identify the root cause by Friday. Sameer, can you please add a note on the compliance risk this poses for the RBI mandate timeline? **Owner: Anjali Mehta, Sameer Gupta**, **ETA: EOD June 13.**\n\nLet's use this time to get everyone on the same page and agree on these actions.

As per JIRA ticket PAY-5942, this puts us in a state of non-compliance and requires immediate remediation.

Building on the analysis from file 37f9704238aa47a3, I've done a deeper dive into the KYC automation failures we're seeing for high-risk customer segments.\n\nAs we discussed, this is a critical blocker for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate implementation (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3). Currently, our KYC automation flow is failing for users flagged by our internal risk engine, forcing us into a manual verification process that is not sustainable and jeopardizes our compliance timeline.\n\nHere are the technical specifics from our side:\n\nOur service is making POST requests to your `/v2/customer/enhanced-kyc-check` endpoint. For the majority of transactions, the flow works as expected with a p99 latency of around 550ms. However, for transactions identified as high-risk, we're consistently receiving an HTTP `422 Unprocessable Entity` response. The error body contains a generic code `E1029: Invalid_Payload_Data` without any specific field-level context.\n\nI've been tailing the logs in Kibana, and I can confirm that the request payloads for these failed transactions are structurally identical to the successful ones and fully conform to the API contract documentation we have. The issue is not with the OAuth 2.0 token exchange; our JWTs are being generated and accepted correctly. Our Grafana dashboard for the ICICI integration shows the error rate for this specific endpoint spiking to over 15% during peak hours, directly correlating with the volume of high-risk segment transactions.\n\nOur current hypothesis is that there might be a secondary validation layer on your end that is rejecting requests based on a specific combination of data points (e.g., transaction amount thresholds + IP geolocation) before the request hits the core KYC processing logic. Without more descriptive errors, we're essentially flying blind. This is tracked internally under JIRA PAY-8826.\n\nTo move forward, could you please assist with the following?\n\n1.  **Enhanced Error Logging:** Is it possible for your team to investigate the server-side logs for the transaction IDs provided in PAY-8826 and give us the exact validation rule that is being triggered to cause the `E1029` error? \n2.  **API Behavior Clarification:** Can you confirm if the API has different validation paths for requests that meet certain risk criteria? If so, could we get documentation on those specific validation rules?\n\nI am in the process of preparing a set of cURL commands with anonymized data that reliably reproduce this issue in our staging environment. I will attach them to the JIRA ticket shortly.\n\nIt would be really helpful to schedule a 30-minute technical call with your API engineering team to resolve this.

The data you shared about the latency spikes post-ICICI's core banking migration is concerning, and I've spent the morning analyzing this from a compliance standpoint for our RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate implementation (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nTo be blunt, this bottleneck puts us in a precarious position. The Grafana dashboards confirm your findings: the p99 latency for the `/v2/transactions/verify` endpoint is hitting 2.2s, up from a stable ~250ms baseline. The Kibana logs are showing a corresponding surge in `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors, which have jumped from 0.2% to a completely unacceptable 3.5% during peak hours. Our internal processing time from request ingestion to hitting the ICICI API gateway remains constant at ~45ms, which isolates the issue squarely on their end.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, this is a critical failure. The RBI mandate requires near real-time screening, and latencies of this magnitude will cause us to breach those guidelines. It directly impacts our ability to perform effective fraud analysis, as our models rely on a rapid response to block suspicious transactions. A 2-second delay is more than enough for fraudulent activity to complete. This not only jeopardizes the project but also puts our broader SOC 2 and PCI DSS attestations at risk due to processing integrity failures.\n\nI’ve updated JIRA PAY-5740 with these compliance-specific risks and attached the initial risk assessment from file#37f9704238aa47a3 for context.\n\nHere’s what I propose for our immediate next steps:\n\n1.  **Escalation:** I have already initiated a formal escalation with our partner manager for ICICI, highlighting the direct violation of our agreed-upon API SLAs and the severe regulatory implications. We need an official RCA and a concrete remediation plan from them urgently.\n\n2.  **Mitigation:** Can your team investigate implementing a more aggressive timeout (e.g., 800ms) and a circuit breaker on our side for this specific endpoint? While this will increase our direct failure rate for ICICI transactions, it will protect the stability of our upstream systems and prevent cascading failures. It's a trade-off, but a necessary one for now.\n\n3.  **Impact Analysis:** Could you please prepare a quantitative report on the number of transactions being impacted per hour at peak load (around 20K TPS)? Leadership will require this data to understand the full business impact.\n\nI am scheduling an urgent call with the ICICI technical leads for tomorrow. We need to push for a resolution timeline.

This is directly responsible for a 3.5 percentage point drop in our overall transaction success rate for the bank, which is not sustainable.\n\n2.  **System-Level Analysis:** Digging into the Kibana logs tagged under JIRA PAY-7477, it appears the `VELOCITY_CHECK_NEW_DEVICE_ID` and `HIGH_VALUE_TXN_UNUSUAL_GEO` rules are overly aggressive. The Grafana dashboard for our fraud engine confirms this, showing these two rules account for nearly 85% of all `TXN_BLOCKED_BY_RISK_POLICY` errors. The current configuration is clearly not tuned correctly for the nuances of ICICI’s user base.\n\n3.  **Operational Overhead:** The volume of legitimate transactions being blocked has created a backlog of over 6,000 manual review tickets for my team in just two days. This is an unmanageable load and directly impacts our ability to investigate genuine high-risk cases, ironically undermining the very goal of the RBI mandate.\n\nWhile compliance is non-negotiable, we can't afford to hemorrhage legitimate transactions like this. We need to recalibrate the model urgently without compromising our compliance posture. \n\n**Proposed Action Plan:**\n\n*   **Immediate (Today):** Can we please deploy the fraud model in ‘shadow mode’ for ICICI UPI traffic? It would run the rules and log the outcomes via our internal `/logEvent` endpoint but won't trigger the OAuth flow to actually block the transaction. This will give us clean data for recalibration without impacting users.\n*   **Short-Term (Next 48-72 hours):** I’ll work with Sameer's data science team to analyze the shadow mode logs. We need to identify new thresholds for the problematic rules. The analysis from file#37f9704238aa47a3 on user segmentation should be a good starting point.\n*   **External Communication:** I will schedule a call with the ICICI Bank risk team to give them a heads-up. I’ll frame it as a routine optimization to maintain a high success rate while ensuring full compliance, so we don't cause unnecessary alarm.\n\nCould you please confirm if the engineering team can get the shadow mode deployment live in the staging environment for a quick test, with a plan to push to production by EOD? I’ve already updated the main ticket, PAY-7477, with these details.\n\nThis is becoming a bit of a pressure cooker situation with the looming deadline.

Building on your initial findings from email 02866e5a85cc46d3, our SRE team has done a deeper dive, and the situation is indeed concerning.\n\nDuring yesterday's load test run at 15:30 IST, our Grafana dashboards lit up. We observed the p99 latency for your `/transaction/monitor` API endpoint spiking from a stable ~220ms to over 2.8 seconds once the load surpassed 600 TPS. Our internal service latency remained flat at under 40ms, which strongly indicates the bottleneck is downstream within your newly migrated core banking system.\n\nMore critically, this latency surge was accompanied by a cluster of `504 Gateway Timeout` errors, with the error rate hitting 5.2%. This is a significant breach of our agreed-upon 0.2% error-rate SLA and is being tracked under JIRA PAY-3915. Our Kubernetes pods for the UPI gateway scaled as expected, so this doesn't appear to be a resource constraint on our end. Priya, our SRE lead, has already shared a snapshot of the dashboard from this window in file#37f9704238aa47a3.\n\nAs you know, the RBI mandate for enhanced monitoring (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3) has a hard deadline, and this performance bottleneck puts our go-live schedule at serious risk. We cannot proceed to production with a system that exhibits this level of instability under a moderate load, let alone our projected peak of 10K TPS.\n\nTo move forward decisively, here are the proposed action items:\n\n1.  **ICICI Bank Team:** Could you please initiate a thorough performance investigation on your core banking system? We need to understand the processing capacity, database connection pool status, and any internal queuing that might be causing this slowdown. A detailed report with your findings by EOD tomorrow would be immensely helpful.\n\n2.  **Juspay SRE Team (Priya):** Please collate a dozen representative trace IDs from our Kibana logs that clearly demonstrate the latency spike and the 504 errors. Share these directly with Vikram's team to aid their debugging efforts.\n\n3.  **Joint Debugging Session:** I am requesting we set up a joint war-room call for tomorrow afternoon to review the data from both sides. This will be crucial for root cause analysis.\n\nOur immediate goal is to restore the p99 latency to sub-300ms and eliminate these timeout errors.

Building on your analysis in email 1bad8a5072d645d5, I've spent the morning digging into the logs for the ICICI UPI settlement process as part of Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3.\n\nHere's a summary of my findings:\n\n1.  **Mismatch Identification:** I've cross-referenced the transaction logs from our UPI gateway's Kubernetes pods with the T+1 settlement file provided by ICICI (ref: file#37f9704238aa47a3). The mismatch originates from a specific batch of 52 transactions processed yesterday between 14:30 and 14:45 IST, totaling a discrepancy of ₹1,12,450.\n\n2.  **Performance Metrics:** Our Grafana dashboards for that window show a transient latency spike on the `icici-upi-payment-confirmation` endpoint, jumping from our P99 of ~120ms to around 450ms. However, the overall error rate remained stable at <0.2%, and there were no OAuth token renewal failures or other authentication issues reported. All 52 transactions were marked 'SUCCESS' on our end, with valid acknowledgements from the NPCI network.\n\n3.  **Log Analysis:** A deep dive into the Kibana logs confirms our systems successfully processed these payments. The issue appears to be downstream. Our reconciliation service, which polls ICICI’s `/fetchSettlementReport` API, is receiving a consistent but incomplete dataset, indicating these transactions were dropped before being included in the final settlement file.\n\nThis is a bit concerning given the tight deadlines for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate. Ensuring 100% data integrity between our logs and the bank's settlement report is a critical compliance requirement. Any data loss, even transient, could jeopardize our audit readiness.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   I have logged the full details, including the affected `transaction_ids`, in **JIRA PAY-7507**.\n*   I have initiated a manual adjustment for the ₹1,12,450 to ensure our merchant accounts are reconciled correctly for now.\n*   **Action for you:** Could you please escalate this to our technical counterparts at ICICI Bank with high priority? Please reference JIRA PAY-7507 and request a root cause analysis for why these successfully acknowledged transactions were excluded from their settlement batch. We need to understand if this was a one-off glitch or a systemic issue.\n\nI'll continue to monitor today's settlement cycle closely.

The latency spike you highlighted is concerning from a compliance standpoint, particularly for Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3.\n\nI've spent some time this morning cross-referencing the Grafana dashboards with our compliance audit logs in Kibana for the period you mentioned. The P99 latency for the real-time risk scoring engine jumping from our baseline of ~212ms to over 1.8s is a significant deviation. My primary concern is how our system behaves at that latency threshold. The RBI mandate requires that every transaction is assessed against the new enhanced monitoring rules. If our service times out and falls back to a legacy or simpler rule set to maintain transaction throughput, we are creating a major compliance gap. This would directly violate the spirit and letter of the new regulations discussed in our initial planning (ref: file#37f9704238aa47a3).\n\nLooking at the logs, I see a pattern of `RiskEngine_Timeout_Error` being thrown by the UPI gateway for transactions that were routed through the new ICICI API endpoint. This suggests that instead of failing the transaction, we might be processing it without the complete risk score from the ICICI module. We need to immediately quantify how many transactions were affected during that 45-minute window yesterday. Every single one could be considered non-compliant and would be a serious finding in our next SOC 2 audit, not to mention the RBI's own reviews.\n\nThis needs to be treated with the highest priority. I've updated JIRA PAY-9200 with these compliance-specific concerns.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Owner: Aditya Singh):** Please prioritize the Root Cause Analysis for JIRA PAY-9200. I need to know if this was a transient network issue, a problem with the ICICI API itself, or an issue with our Kubernetes pod scaling under load. ETA for RCA: EOD today.\n\n2.  **Engineering (Owner: Aditya Singh):** Can you provide a list of `transaction_ids` that were processed where the risk engine call exceeded the 800ms timeout during the incident? We need to run a retroactive risk analysis on them.\n\n3.  **Compliance (Owner: Priya Nair):** I will initiate a formal query with our technical contacts at ICICI Bank regarding this latency spike. Their API performance is well outside the sub-300ms SLA we have in our agreement. I'll be referencing this incident in my communication.\n\nLet's connect for a quick 15-minute sync later this afternoon to discuss the findings of the RCA before I reach out to the bank.

While we appreciate the update on your core banking system migration, we've identified a critical performance bottleneck that is putting our joint project for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring Mandate at significant risk.\n\nAs you know, this implementation (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3) is time-sensitive and compliance-critical. Our staging environment tests against your new `/v2/transactions/enrichment` endpoint are showing severe latency issues. Per our agreed-upon SLA, we expected p99 latency to be under 250ms. However, we are consistently observing response times between 1.5s and 2.5s, which is an order of magnitude higher than acceptable.\n\nThis latency is causing cascading failures in our transaction processing pipeline. Our Grafana dashboards show a direct correlation between calls to your API and a spike in our overall transaction processing time. Consequently, our error rate has jumped from a baseline of 0.2% to over 4.5% due to upstream services timing out. I've attached a log export from Kibana as file#37f9704238aa47a3, which details the frequent `504 Gateway Timeout` errors originating from our calls to your service.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this delay makes it impossible for our fraud detection engine to perform real-time risk scoring, which is a non-negotiable requirement of the new RBI mandate. We've verified on our end that our requests are correctly authenticated via the OAuth 2.0 flow with valid JWTs, and network latency from our Kubernetes cluster to your ingress is nominal. This strongly suggests the bottleneck is within your new core banking system's processing layer.\n\nWe have logged this internally as JIRA PAY-8688. Could you please prioritize an investigation into the performance of the services backing this endpoint? The issue seems to be exacerbated under load, suggesting potential database contention or insufficient resource allocation for your service. As discussed in our planning call and documented in my previous summary (email#7f0d9bb9d30f41e4), this real-time enrichment is the cornerstone of the entire solution.\n\nGiven the looming deadline, we need to resolve this urgently. Can you please provide us with an ETA for a root cause analysis and a proposed remediation plan by EOD tomorrow?

Building on your findings in email e278cc6ef99444ea, I'm growing a bit concerned about the current state of the multi-currency settlement process with ICICI Bank for the RBI mandate implementation (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nThe key issue is that the current synchronous API flow for settlement initiation is not scaling as we anticipated. Our Grafana dashboards show the P99 latency for the `/v2/settlements/initiate` endpoint is averaging 1.8s under a simulated load of just 5K TPS, with spikes up to 2.5s. This is well above our acceptable threshold of 800ms and poses a significant risk to achieving a smooth T+1 settlement cycle at scale. Furthermore, the Kibana logs confirm intermittent `503 Service Unavailable` responses from ICICI's gateway during these load tests, which points to a potential bottleneck on their end.\n\nOn the reconciliation front, the 1.2% mismatch rate you highlighted, based on the report format in file#37f9704238aa47a3, is too high for production. Manually reconciling these discrepancies for multi-currency transactions (USD, EUR, SGD) will create significant operational overhead. The core issue seems to be the lack of a clear mapping between our internal transaction ID and the bank's settlement batch ID in the files provided.\n\nTo address this and stay on track for our compliance deadline, I have a few proposals for the ICICI team:\n\n1.  **Transition to an Asynchronous Flow:** Can you confirm if your platform supports an asynchronous settlement initiation model? A pattern where we post the batch and receive an immediate `202 Accepted` response, followed by a webhook callback upon successful processing, would be far more resilient and scalable. This would decouple our systems and mitigate the impact of the latency spikes we're observing.\n\n2.  **Enrich Reconciliation Data:** Would it be possible to enhance the daily settlement report (delivered via SFTP) to include two additional fields: `juspay_transaction_id` (which we pass in the initial payment request) and `applied_forex_rate`? This would automate nearly 99.9% of the reconciliation process and is critical for auditability under the new RBI mandate.\n\nOur engineering team has documented these requirements in JIRA ticket PAY-9228.\n\nAditya, please continue to monitor the UAT environment and model the potential impact of an async flow.\n\nVikram and Priya, could you please review these suggestions with your technical team and let us know about the feasibility and a potential timeline?

Building on the initial alert from your email (aeed7583a5164b3e), I've completed a deeper investigation into the performance bottleneck we're seeing post ICICI's core banking system migration last night. The situation is a bit concerning, as it directly impacts our progress on the RBI mandate implementation (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\nSince ICICI switched to their new CBS, we've observed a critical performance degradation in our payment authorization flow. Our primary Grafana dashboard (`icici-upi-latency`) shows P99 latency for the `/payments/authorize` endpoint spiking from a stable baseline of ~180ms to sustained periods of 1.5s - 2.5s. This is well outside our SLA of 400ms.\n\nThis latency has led to a cascading effect:\n*   **Error Rate Spike:** Our overall transaction error rate with ICICI has jumped from 0.2% to 3.5%, primarily due to `504 Gateway Timeouts` as our systems time out waiting for a response.\n*   **Throughput Throttling:** We're unable to sustain our target of 10,000 TPS. Our processing queues are backing up, and our auto-scaler is struggling to compensate for a bottleneck that appears to be external.\n\n**Investigation Details (JIRA PAY-3536):**\n\n1.  **Internal Systems Check:** I've verified our infrastructure is not the root cause. We scaled our Kubernetes transaction processor deployments from 60 to 90 pods, but this had zero impact on the end-to-end latency. Our internal network latency, Redis cache performance, and database loads are all nominal.\n\n2.  **Log Analysis:** Kibana logs (index: `icici-proxy-logs-*`) confirm the delay originates from ICICI's end. The `time_to_first_byte` from their API gateway (`api.icicibank.com`) is where we're seeing the massive variance. Our internal processing time before handing off the request remains consistent at ~45ms.\n\n3.  **Compliance Risk:** At this performance level, we cannot guarantee the stability required for the RBI's Enhanced Transaction Monitoring framework. The unpredictable latency makes real-time risk assessment unreliable.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\nThis issue seems firmly rooted in the performance of ICICI's newly migrated core banking system. We need to escalate this to their technical team immediately.\n\n1.  **Request for Investigation:** We need the ICICI Bank engineering team to investigate the performance of their backend systems serving the payment authorization API. We need to know if the new CBS is under-provisioned or experiencing initialization issues.\n\n2.  **Data for Debugging:** Can we request their APM traces or detailed processing logs for a set of transaction IDs? I have attached a list of slow/failed `transaction_ids` to PAY-3536 for their reference.\n\n3.  **Capacity Confirmation:** We need to re-verify against the capacity plan outlined in Doc#37f9704238aa47a3. It's critical to confirm their new system was benchmarked to handle our peak load projections.\n\nGiven the hard deadline for the RBI mandate, resolving this is our highest priority. I'd suggest we schedule an urgent joint-debugging call with their technical leads for tomorrow morning.

This impacts our SLA of 99.95% uptime.\n2.  **Compliance Failure:** These delays make it impossible for our fraud detection engine to perform the sub-second risk scoring required by the RBI.

I'm writing to follow up on a critical aspect of the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate implementation, specifically regarding the multi-currency settlement process (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nOur engineering team has integrated with your staging environment's `/v2/settlements/initiate` and `/v2/settlements/reconcile` endpoints. While the standard INR settlement flow is working within the expected T+1 timeframe, we are encountering significant delays with non-INR currencies (primarily USD, EUR, and SGD). This is becoming a bit of a concern as we approach our internal deadlines for compliance readiness.\n\nTechnically, here's what we're observing:\n\n1.  **Latency Spikes:** Our Grafana dashboards show that the P99 latency for the `/v2/settlements/reconcile` callback for multi-currency batches is spiking to over 2.5 seconds. In contrast, INR reconciliation callbacks are consistently under 800ms. This high latency directly impacts our ability to update transaction statuses in real-time.\n\n2.  **Settlement Cycle Delay:** The end-to-end process for these non-INR transactions is pushing the settlement cycle closer to T+2. Our analysis of Kibana logs suggests the bottleneck occurs after your system accepts the batch file but before the forex conversion rate is finalized and communicated back to us. This delay prevents us from meeting the stricter T+1 reporting and reconciliation timelines required by the RBI mandate.\n\nThis issue has been logged under JIRA PAY-9576. As you know, automating this flow is crucial for us to manage the projected transaction volumes (peaking at ~15k TPS) and maintain our 99.95% uptime SLA without manual intervention.\n\nBuilding on the analysis from email 7f0d9bb9d30f41e4, we were under the impression from the initial spec (File#37f9704238aa47a3) that there would be a more deterministic way to handle forex conversions. The current asynchronous process introduces a variability that is proving difficult to manage from a compliance standpoint.\n\nCould your technical team please help us with the following?\n\n*   **Action Item (ICICI):** Investigate the root cause of the high latency on the `/v2/settlements/reconcile` endpoint for multi-currency batches.\n*   **Action Item (ICICI):** Clarify if there is a different parameter or a separate, synchronous endpoint we can call to get the final forex conversion details immediately after submission. Is there a way to lock in the rate programmatically?\n\nAnjali (CC'd), our tech lead, will consolidate the relevant trace IDs and log snippets from our Kubernetes pods and attach them to the JIRA ticket for your team's review.\n\nTo resolve this quickly, I propose a 30-minute technical sync call with our respective engineering teams this week. Please let me know what day and time would work best for you.\n\nThanks for your continued partnership on this important project.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRohit"],"timestamp":1757914380000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["vikram.singh@icicibank.com"],"cc":["anjali.mehta@juspay.in","sameer.gupta@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on your summary from email 6ad1247a5eea4f6a, I've completed the first round of integration testing for the ICICI multi-currency settlement optimization, which is a critical part of the RBI mandate implementation (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nI have some concerns regarding the performance and data integrity of their new `/settlement/multiCurrency/v2` endpoint. Here’s a summary of my findings:\n\n1.  **API Latency Issues:** In our staging environment, we're seeing P99 latencies consistently averaging 1.8s, with spikes up to 2.5s under simulated load (~15K transactions). This is significantly higher than our target of <800ms for batch settlement jobs to ensure we meet the T+1 reconciliation timeline. The 'ICICI-Settlement-Staging' Grafana dashboard clearly shows these performance bottlenecks.\n\n2.  **Incomplete Payload Data:** This is the more pressing issue. The API response is frequently missing critical fields required for automated reconciliation. Specifically, the `forexConversionRate` and `originalTransactionCurrency` fields are returning as null for a significant percentage of transactions. This contradicts the schema defined in their API specification document (file#37f9704238aa47a3). I've analyzed the Kibana logs, and this data omission is causing a ~1.2% validation failure rate in our settlement service, which is a blocker for go-live.\n\n3.  **Impact on Compliance:** Without these fields, our reconciliation engine cannot process multi-currency settlements automatically, forcing a manual intervention that is not scalable and puts us at risk of non-compliance with the RBI's enhanced monitoring requirements. The OAuth 2.0 and JWT token management are working as expected, so the issue seems localized to ICICI's backend processing logic.\n\nI've documented these findings in JIRA PAY-5008. We need a stable and complete API from ICICI to proceed.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Arjun (Me):** I am preparing a formal report with Grafana snapshots and Kibana log samples to send to our technical contacts at ICICI, referencing our previous communication (email#7f0d9bb9d30f41e4). I will request an urgent investigation and a clear ETA for a fix.\n*   **Aditya (You):** Could you and the product team assess the feasibility of a temporary workaround? Perhaps a fallback mechanism to manually enrich the data, though I know this is far from ideal.\n\nLet’s connect for a quick 15-minute call tomorrow morning to align on our communication strategy with the bank.

Building on your point from email f383e9b011cb460a, the ICICI Bank API rate limiting is now a critical blocker for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nOur compliance and engineering teams have been trying to execute load testing in the UAT environment, but we are consistently hitting a wall. Our Grafana dashboards show that we are being throttled by their `/v2/payments/validate` endpoint, receiving `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors as soon as our transaction volume exceeds approximately 50-60 TPS. The error rate spikes from our baseline of 0.15% to over 20% during these tests, which is completely untenable.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, this is becoming a serious concern. The RBI guidelines require us to demonstrate robust monitoring and fraud detection capabilities under realistic peak load conditions, which for us is in the range of 450-500 TPS. Without the ability to simulate this load, we cannot validate our risk models or generate the necessary audit logs and performance benchmarks for the final submission. This directly jeopardizes our ability to meet the regulatory deadline.\n\nThe issue is being tracked under JIRA PAY-1463. I’ve reviewed the original integration agreement (ref file#37f9704238aa47a3), and the stated UAT environment SLAs do not mention such restrictive rate limits. We need to push back on this, as it deviates from our agreed-upon testing scope.\n\nCould you please escalate this again with our technical contacts at ICICI? We need a definitive timeline for when these limits on their UAT environment will be raised to at least 1,000 TPS to give us sufficient headroom. A verbal confirmation isn't enough at this stage; we need it in writing to de-risk our project plan.\n\nLet’s connect tomorrow to strategize on our next communication with them.

Building on your findings in email a0f8acec382c4dbe, I’ve done a deeper dive into the KYC automation failures we're seeing with ICICI Bank for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nTo be frank, the situation is becoming critical. Our automated KYC process for customers flagged by our internal risk engine as 'high-risk' is consistently failing. We are seeing a failure rate of approximately 12% for this specific cohort, which translates to a significant number of transactions that are falling into a manual review queue. This is not a sustainable model, especially with the mandate deadline fast approaching.\n\nHere’s a summary of our technical investigation:\n\n1.  **API Endpoint & Authentication**: We are making calls to ICICI's `/v2/customer/enhancedKYC` endpoint. The authentication, which uses an OAuth 2.0 flow to generate a JWT bearer token, appears to be working correctly. We are not seeing any 401/403 errors.\n\n2.  **Error Pattern**: The issue is subtle. Instead of a clear HTTP error, the API is returning a `200 OK` status. However, the response body contains a status field `result: PENDING_MANUAL_REVIEW` along with an internal code `errorCode: EKYC-901`. Our Kibana logs (index: `payment-gateway-prod-*`) confirm our request payloads are well-formed and match the specifications in file#37f9704238aa47a3.\n\n3.  **Performance Impact**: Our Grafana dashboard for this integration shows a significant latency spike for these failed requests. The p99 latency is hitting ~2.2s, compared to our baseline of 450ms for successful KYC checks. While this hasn't yet breached our overall UPI gateway uptime SLA of 99.95%, it is causing downstream delays and is a major compliance concern.\n\n4.  **Hypothesis**: Our leading theory, expanding on the discussion from email `7f0d9bb9d30f41e4`, is that ICICI's backend rules engine is incorrectly interpreting or rejecting some of the risk-enrichment data we are passing. Specifically, fields like `customerRiskCategory`, `sourceOfFunds`, and `transactionVelocityScore` seem to be the trigger. The API documentation lacks clear validation rules or accepted enum values for these fields when `customerSegment` is 'HIGH_RISK'.\n\nThis entire issue is being tracked under JIRA PAY-3991.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **For the ICICI Team**: Could you please urgently investigate the server-side logs for requests from our system that resulted in the `EKYC-901` code? We can provide a list of `traceId`s (all begin with `JP-KYC-FAIL-*`). We need a clear definition of what this code signifies and what your expected values are for the risk-related fields mentioned above. We need this to move forward.\n\n*   **For Aditya (Juspay)**: Please continue collating the failed `traceId`s. Also, start scoping a potential fallback solution to route these specific high-risk KYC requests to an alternate provider as a contingency. Let's track this effort as a sub-task within PAY-3991.\n\nI am scheduling an urgent 30-minute technical sync for tomorrow morning with both teams to debug this live.

This is causing a cascade of API timeouts and has completely stalled our UAT progress.\n\nHere are the technical specifics:\n\n- **Endpoint:** ICICI's `POST /v2/oauth/token` endpoint.\n- **Symptom:** Our internal `ICICI-Auth-Service` is experiencing an error rate of approximately 70-80% on token refresh calls, returning a mix of `504 Gateway Timeout` and intermittent `401 Unauthorized` errors.\n- **Performance Impact:** Our Grafana monitoring shows that the p99 latency for dependent APIs (e.g., payment initiation) has degraded from a baseline of ~250ms to over 3 seconds before timing out. This is a clear breach of the SLA defined in our agreement.\n- **Logs & Tracking:** Our engineering team has compiled relevant Kibana logs with trace IDs and correlation IDs, which are now attached to JIRA ticket PAY-5160. The pattern suggests that the issue is isolated to the token refresh flow; initial token generation works as expected.\n\nThis is becoming a serious bottleneck. All testing activities for this mandate are blocked, which puts our go-live date in jeopardy. As you know, meeting the RBI deadline is non-negotiable.\n\nOur initial hypothesis points to a potential misconfiguration or an overly aggressive rate-limiter on the ICICI UAT cluster that is incorrectly flagging our legitimate token refresh requests.

Since deploying the new module to our staging environment yesterday at 14:30 IST, our false positive rate has spiked from a baseline of 0.2% to 4.5%. This is directly impacting our transaction processing pipeline and is not sustainable.\n\nHere are the specifics:\n\n*   **Impacted Endpoint:** The increased latency is primarily on our UPI gateway's `/payments/v2/process` endpoint. P99 latency has degraded from an average of 215ms to over 450ms.\n*   **Error Analysis:** Kibana logs show a massive surge in transactions being rejected with the error code `FRD-801` (Suspicious Transaction Pattern), which is coming directly from the new ICICI monitoring service. We're seeing this disproportionately affect low-value, high-frequency UPI transactions (sub-₹500 range).\n*   **Volume:** This translates to approximately 1,200 legitimate transactions per hour being incorrectly flagged for manual review, overwhelming our risk team and violating our internal SLA for transaction success rates.\n\nOur initial investigation, tracked under JIRA PAY-5573, suggests the model’s feature set may not be correctly calibrated for our production traffic patterns. It appears to be overly aggressive and doesn't seem to account for the transaction velocity typical of our top merchants. I've attached a snapshot from our Grafana dashboard (see linked file#37f9704238aa47a3) which clearly illustrates the spike post-deployment.\n\nWhile we are fully committed to meeting the RBI compliance deadline, we cannot move this to production in its current state.

Your analysis of the p99 latency spikes on ICICI's end aligns perfectly with what I'm seeing from a compliance and risk monitoring perspective for Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3.\n\nThe core of my concern is the direct impact on our ability to meet the RBI mandate. The enhanced monitoring requires near real-time data enrichment for our fraud detection models to be effective. The performance we're observing post-migration on their core banking system is putting this entire initiative at risk.\n\nHere's what our monitoring shows from the latest integration tests against their UAT environment:\n\n*   **API Endpoint:** `/v2/transactions/enrich`\n*   **Performance Degradation:** Our Grafana dashboards show that while baseline latency hovers around an acceptable ~300ms, it spikes to over 2.5s during simulated peak loads of just 40K TPS. This is a far cry from the sub-500ms we agreed upon.\n*   **Error Rates:** We're seeing a sustained error rate of 4-5% during these peaks, primarily `503 Service Unavailable` and `504 Gateway Timeout` errors. Kibana logs confirm these are timeouts originating from their end, not from our Kubernetes pod scaling or network configuration.\n*   **Compliance Risk:** An error rate above 0.5% and latency over 1s for this enrichment step is a non-starter for compliance. It creates a window for fraudulent transactions to slip through before our risk engine can score them, directly contravening the mandate's spirit and letter.\n\nFrankly, I'm getting a bit concerned. ICICI's assurances from our call last week (ref: email#7f0d9bb9d30f41e4) that their new core banking system was load-tested and ready have not been met. This isn't just a technical glitch; it's a major compliance roadblock, and the deadline isn't moving.\n\nI have updated JIRA PAY-5087 with these latest findings. My proposed action plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Formal Escalation:** I will draft a formal communication to our contacts at ICICI, citing the specific SLA discrepancies and the direct compliance risk. I'll need a consolidated performance report from your team to attach as evidence. Could you please package the relevant Grafana dashboard exports and Kibana query results into a summary doc (similar to the one in `file#37f9704238aa47a3`) by EOD tomorrow?\n\n2.  **Contingency Planning:** While we push ICICI, we need a Plan B. Can we investigate a temporary solution on our side? Perhaps a circuit breaker that bypasses enrichment for low-risk transactions if ICICI's API latency exceeds 800ms? It's not ideal, but it might be better than failing transactions entirely and impacting the user experience.\n\nLet's connect tomorrow morning to align on the escalation document.

P99 latency was stable at ~210ms, and our processing error rate was well below 0.1%. The OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT management are also functioning as expected, ruling out an authentication issue.\n\nMy hypothesis is a data synchronization failure between ICICI's real-time transaction system and the batch process that generates their settlement files.

Normal-risk customer KYC calls are unaffected and continue to process with a P99 latency of ~320ms.\n\nOur Kibana logs (index: `juspay-kyc-prod-*`) show that calls to the ICICI `/v2/customer/verify-risk-profile` endpoint are returning a `503 Service Unavailable` error, but only when the request payload contains a high-risk profile identifier. The average response time for these failed requests is spiking to over 2.5s before timing out, which points towards a processing bottleneck on your side.\n\nThis is creating a significant operational backlog and jeopardizing our ability to meet the RBI mandate's onboarding timelines for this work (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3). The manual verification fallback is not a scalable solution, and we're tracking this as a high-priority incident under JIRA PAY-8499.\n\nOn our end, we've validated the following:\n1.  Our OAuth 2.0 flow is healthy, and we are successfully generating and refreshing JWT tokens.\n2.  The request payload structure is identical to the specification in `file#37f9704238aa47a3` and has not changed.\n3.  There are no anomalies in our Kubernetes pod deployments or egress traffic patterns.\n\nOur hypothesis is that a WAF rule or a new rate-limiter configuration on your infrastructure might be incorrectly throttling or blocking these specific, more complex verification requests. The SLAs we established in our initial discussions (referenced in email 7f0d9bb9d30f41e4) guaranteed sufficient capacity, so this is quite unexpected.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **ICICI Team:** Can you please have your API platform team urgently investigate the server-side logs for the `/v2/customer/verify-risk-profile` service? We need to know if you're seeing application-level errors or resource contention when processing requests with high-risk flags.\n2.  **Juspay Team (Internal):** I've asked Sameer to prepare a log dump of representative failed request IDs and correlation IDs to share with your team.\n\nGiven the urgency, could we schedule a 30-minute joint-debugging call with your technical team today? We need to get to the bottom of this before end of day to avoid further compliance risk.\n\nPlease let me know what time works best.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRohit Sharma\nBusiness Development Manager\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757916240000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["anjali.verma@icicibank.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on your analysis from email 002a033b32b54daf, I've completed a deeper dive into the API timeouts we're seeing with the ICICI Bank integration for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nMy investigation confirms that the timeouts are a direct result of failures in the OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow. Our Grafana dashboard for `icici-integration-health` shows P99 latency for the `/transactions/report` endpoint spiking to over 2.5s, which is causing a cascading failure and a transaction error rate of approximately 3.8% over the last six hours. This is significantly above our 0.2% tolerance.\n\nLooking at the Kibana logs from our `payment-integrations` Kubernetes pods, the pattern is consistent: our service attempts to use a JWT, receives an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` (as expected for an expired token), but the subsequent automated call to ICICI's `https://api.icicibank.com/oauth/token` endpoint is timing out after our configured 1500ms threshold. This is happening intermittently, roughly every 60-90 minutes, which makes me suspect a rate-limiter or a bottleneck on the bank's authentication service rather than a persistent misconfiguration on our end. All of these findings have been documented in JIRA PAY-7649.\n\n**Immediate Mitigation:**\nAs a temporary fix, I've deployed a hotfix to the staging environment that introduces a more aggressive retry strategy with exponential backoff specifically for the token refresh endpoint. I also manually flushed our Redis token cache and triggered a rolling restart of the service pods. This has stabilized the error rate for now, bringing it down to ~0.4%, but it's not a viable long-term solution as it introduces jitter and additional latency.\n\n**Compliance Risk:**\nThis instability poses a direct risk to our compliance with the RBI mandate. As outlined in the project specifications (referenced in Doc#8bd09e5e47854338), we are required to maintain a 99.9% success rate for transaction reporting. These data gaps, even if temporary, could become a significant audit finding.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **[ICICI Bank Team]** - We urgently need your team to investigate the performance of the `/oauth/token` endpoint. Please check for any rate-limiting policies that might be triggered by our NAT gateway's IP or any performance degradation on your authentication servers. The timestamps and relevant request IDs are attached to PAY-7649.\n\n2.  **[Arjun Mehta]** - I will continue to monitor the dashboards and have configured a high-priority alert in our alert management system to trigger if the P99 latency on the token endpoint exceeds 1.2s or if the `401` error count surpasses 20 per minute.\n\nWe really need to get to the bottom of this by EOD to ensure we don't face further disruptions.

Building on that, I need to urgently escalate a critical performance issue we're facing with the transaction enrichment API.\n\nOur staging environment tests for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3) are being consistently throttled by your API gateway. We are observing a hard cap at approximately 400 TPS. Our Grafana dashboards clearly show a spike in `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` responses from the `/v2/transactions/enrich` endpoint whenever our simulated load exceeds this threshold. This is causing our integration error rate to jump from a baseline of 0.2% to over 4.5%, which is unacceptable for a production-grade system and well outside our SLA of 99.95% uptime.\n\nAs per the technical specifications outlined in the signed-off spec sheet, our production traffic is projected to require a sustained throughput of at least 1,200 TPS during peak hours to remain compliant with the real-time monitoring aspect of the RBI mandate. The current rate limit is a major blocker and puts the entire project timeline at risk. We are tracking this internally as a critical issue under JIRA PAY-6346. I've also re-attached the log correlation analysis from Kibana (file#37f9704238aa47a3) for your reference, which was initially shared in email#7f0d9bb9d30f41e4.\n\nCould you please work with your infrastructure team to have the rate limits for our production OAuth 2.0 client ID reviewed and increased?

Building on your observations in email 483818b885f1b44e4, our team has completed an initial investigation into the latency spikes on the real-time risk scoring engine.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards confirm the issue. We observed the P99 latency for calls to ICICI's `/v2/risk/score` endpoint spike from a normal baseline of ~150ms to over 1.8s yesterday between 19:00-20:30 IST. Some requests even timed out after our configured 2.5s threshold. This is particularly concerning as it occurred during a high-volume period, where we were processing roughly 75K TPS.\n\nFrom a business impact perspective, this latency increase has caused our user-facing timeout errors to climb from 0.1% to 0.52% for transactions routed through this flow. While not critical yet, it's a worrying trend, especially given the strict processing timelines under the RBI mandate. We've created JIRA PAY-4232 to track the engineering effort for this (Work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3).\n\nOn our end, we've validated our infrastructure. Our Kubernetes pod metrics show no CPU or memory pressure, and our CI/CD pipeline confirms no recent deployments to the services interacting with this API. We also reviewed our OAuth 2.0 client and JWT token generation logic; everything is functioning within spec. A deep dive into Kibana logs suggests the time-to-first-byte from your endpoint is where the delay is originating.\n\nCould your technical team please investigate the performance of the `/v2/risk/score` service on your side during that specific window? Any insight into potential database load or application-level bottlenecks would be extremely helpful. As per the technical specifications laid out in the integration document (file#37f9704238aa47a3), the SLA for this endpoint is sub-300ms at P99, so we need to get this resolved quickly.\n\nTo fast-track this, would you be open to a quick 30-minute sync between our engineering leads?

Building on the analysis from your email (72567d0e1ae4467f), I've done a deep dive into the API timeouts we're seeing on the ICICI integration.\n\nThe root cause appears to be an intermittent failure within ICICI's OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow. Our `icici-pg-adapter` service is sporadically receiving `invalid_grant` errors from their `/oauth/token` endpoint when attempting to use the `refresh_token`. This is happening well before the documented 60-minute expiry of the access token.\n\nOur Grafana dashboard (ICICI-PG Health) shows a direct correlation between these failures and transaction spikes. When TPS exceeds ~15K, the p99 latency for the token refresh call jumps from its usual ~200ms to over 2.5s, ultimately resulting in a `401 Unauthorized` response on subsequent payment API calls. This is pushing the error rate for the ICICI gateway up by a worrying 2.1% during these windows and impacting our overall transaction success rate.\n\nI've pulled the logs from Kibana for the affected Kubernetes pods, and the pattern is clear. We're seeing a flood of `{\"error\":\"invalid_grant\",\"error_description\":\"Refresh token is invalid or expired\"}`. I’ve attached the relevant log snippets to JIRA PAY-4117 for our records. This instability is a significant risk for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate (Work ID: 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3), as failed authentications lead to gaps in our monitoring logs.\n\n**Immediate Mitigation:**\nAs a temporary fix, I have deployed a hotfix to our staging environment. This change modifies our `icici-pg-adapter` to proactively refresh the token every 45 minutes instead of waiting for the 60-minute TTL. It also incorporates a more robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff specifically for the token endpoint. We are monitoring it closely, and if performance is stable, I plan a phased production rollout during the off-peak hours tonight.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **ICICI Escalation:** I have raised a high-priority ticket with the ICICI technical team, referencing the issue details and our previous discussions (email 7f0d9bb9d30f41e4). I've requested they investigate their OAuth server logs corresponding to our `client_id` during the incident timestamps.\n2.  **Joint Debugging Session:** The current situation is putting our 99.95% uptime SLA at risk. We need to schedule a technical call with ICICI's API gateway engineers to debug this collaboratively. Could you help facilitate this connection?\n3.  **Internal Tracking:** All further progress, RCA, and communications will be logged under JIRA PAY-4117 to maintain a clear audit trail, as required by our compliance process outlined in Doc#37f9704238aa47a3.\n\nLet me know if you have any objections to the planned production rollout.

Building on your findings in email 0ef6c6d98fa74e80, I've conducted a deeper compliance and impact review of the high false positive rate from the ICICI fraud detection model.\n\nThe situation is becoming critical. Our Grafana dashboard shows the false positive rate for transactions routed through ICICI’s new API endpoint has surged to 4.5% over the past 72 hours, a significant deviation from our acceptable baseline of <1%. This is directly impacting our UPI transaction success rate, which has dropped by nearly 3% for transaction values above ₹10,000, causing a poor customer experience and potential revenue loss.\n\nDigging into the Kibana logs, I can confirm your observation. The issue is predominantly linked to transactions flagged with the `F78` (High-Risk Profile Mismatch) error code. The model seems overly aggressive, particularly for legitimate, recurring transactions from merchants with `merchantCategoryCode` in the travel and hospitality sectors. This contradicts the risk parameters we outlined in the initial specification document (ref: file#37f9704238aa47a3). From a compliance perspective, while we must adhere to the RBI mandate, this level of disruption is creating a significant operational burden and is not sustainable. The volume of manual reviews required is overwhelming our ops team.\n\nThis issue was first flagged during UAT over two weeks ago (ref: email#7f0d9bb9d30f41e4), and I'm a bit concerned about the slow turnaround on a resolution from ICICI's end. I have updated the central tracking ticket, JIRA PAY-7831, with these metrics and a summary of the compliance risk.\n\nWe need to escalate this.

This was due to a misconfiguration in the Kubernetes config map for our `cross-border-router` deployment, which was pushed live last night.

Following up on the Slack thread and the incident ticket PAY-7428, the primary agenda is to diagnose and resolve the ongoing latency spike in the real-time risk scoring engine connected to the ICICI gateway. This is a critical component for the RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring project, and the current p99 latencies are breaching our internal SLOs and impacting user experience.\n\nAnjali's team has done some initial analysis. The Grafana dashboard 'Risk-Engine-Performance' shows a clear jump in p99 latency for the `riskScoringService` from a baseline of ~450ms to over 1.8s, starting around 04:00 AM IST. This is leading to a 0.5% increase in timeouts (`HTTP_504`) in the upstream payment-orchestrator. Our first look at BigQuery traces suggests this might be linked to a specific set of rules in the ICICI fraud engine being triggered by a recent surge in high-value international transactions. We don't see a corresponding CPU or memory saturation on our side, which points to a potential bottleneck downstream.\n\nTo move forward, we need to collaborate on a clear path to resolution. Here are the proposed action items:\n1.  **[AI for ICICI]** Suresh/Neha: Can your team please investigate the API logs from your end for the timeframe highlighted in PAY-7428? We need to understand the execution time within your fraud rules engine for the transaction trace IDs we've shared in the linked Google Sheet. ETA: EOD today.\n2.  **[AI for Juspay]** Anjali: Please prepare and share a more comprehensive data dump from our Euler ledger, correlating transaction IDs with specific risk flags that were generated during the latency period. Let's have this ready by 4 PM IST. This will be the file update for Step 5.\n3.  **[AI for Juspay]** Priya & Vikram: Let's assess the feasibility of temporarily diverting transactions below a certain risk threshold to an async validation flow as a mitigation strategy.

Following up on the Slack thread and the preliminary analysis, we're observing a consistent ~0.15% discrepancy in daily UPI settlements which is blocking our final UAT for the RBI Enhanced Monitoring project. The goal here is to align on the root cause and define a concrete, time-bound action plan.\n\nOur initial investigation points towards a specific edge case. Priya’s team has analyzed the data pulled via our BigQuery job 'upi_recon_analysis_prod' and it seems transactions failing with NPCI error code `U30 - Invalid Transaction` are being handled differently. Our Euler ledger correctly marks them as a terminal failure, but the corresponding entries appear to be missing or delayed in ICICI's settlement file. This suggests a state machine difference between our systems. A snapshot from Kibana showing the error spike is attached to the Jira ticket.\n\nHere’s the proposed path forward for discussion:\n1.  **ICICI (Vikram):** Can you please investigate the end-to-end lifecycle for transactions that receive a `U30` response at the ICICI gateway? We need to understand if they are retried, reversed, or enter a manual review queue. A state-transition diagram would be extremely helpful. Proposed ETA: EOD, tomorrow.\n2.  **Juspay Eng (Priya):** Let's scope the effort to build a temporary handler. I think we should create a feature flag, maybe `recon-u30-hold-logic`, to isolate these transactions from the automated reconciliation process until we get a definitive answer from ICICI. This will stop the bleeding. Can you raise a PR with a stub for this by Friday?\n3.  **Juspay Compliance (Rajesh):** Please document this as a known issue and our mitigation strategy in the Confluence doc for the RBI mandate, specifically under the risk assessment section.

Our internal monitoring has flagged significant performance degradation tied to API calls made for transaction enrichment. Aditya from our engineering team has confirmed via Kibana logs and Grafana dashboards that we are hitting `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors during peak load, causing our p99 latency to jump to over 2.5s and a transaction failure rate of nearly 5% on this flow. This directly jeopardizes our compliance deadline.\n\nFollowing a review of the data presented by Aditya, the ICICI team confirmed that our API key was provisioned with a default, lower-tier rate limit of 500 TPS. This was an oversight during the initial setup and is insufficient for the pre-production load tests we're running, let alone our production traffic. The discussion focused on both immediate mitigation and a long-term, scalable solution. We evaluated the risk of continuing with the current limit versus the engineering effort required for a client-side queuing mechanism.\n\nThe agreed path forward is a two-pronged approach. For immediate relief, ICICI has committed to increasing our rate limit to 1500 TPS. This is a temporary measure to unblock our testing and prevent further slippage on the PAY-9531 timeline. Long-term, we will work with ICICI to provision a dedicated vHost or a higher capacity plan that aligns with the projections outlined in our Confluence spec doc. This will ensure we don't face this issue again when we go live.\n\nAction Items:\n- **OWNER: Sunita Rao (ICICI)** - Raise an emergency change request to increase our API key's rate limit to 1500 TPS.

The daily reconciliation reports from our Euler ledger are showing a persistent variance against ICICI's settlement files from their SFTP server. Yesterday's discrepancy was minor, around ~₹1.2L, but it's the pattern that's concerning, especially as it's a blocker for the RBI Enhanced Monitoring project.\n\nPriya's initial deep-dive on the Kibana logs (see attached snapshot in PAY-4045) suggests the issue might originate from how we handle late-settling transactions with NPCI response code `U91` (Transaction Timeout). Our reconciliation engine seems to be classifying them differently than ICICI's final settlement report. Vikram, it would be great if you could bring any insights from your side on how your system processes these specific `U91` cases post the 11 PM cutoff.\n\nLet's use this time to align on the root cause and define a clear path to resolution. Proposed agenda: 1) Jointly review log excerpts for `U91` transactions from both systems. 2) Decide on the fix - whether a patch is needed in our reconciliation parser or if there's a spec clarification required from ICICI. 3) Agree on a temporary manual adjustment process to ensure our books are balanced until the automated fix is deployed.

The existing process, which drops T+2 settlement files (e.g., `ICICI_SETL_YYYYMMDD_FX.csv`), lacks real-time Foreign Exchange (FX) rate timestamps. This deficiency forces our primary reconciliation service, which utilizes a PostgreSQL database, to apply a generic end-of-day rate pulled from our internal FX cache (backed by Redis), frequently causing reconciliation discrepancies exceeding the newly mandated 0.02% variance threshold. These variances trigger manual intervention and generate a high volume of `ERR_RECON_FX_MISMATCH` alerts in our monitoring dashboards.","The proposed solution involves a direct integration with ICICI Bank's new RESTful `settlementDetails_v3` API endpoint. This API must provide, at minimum, the following fields in its JSON response: `juspayTransactionId`, `settlementAmount`, `settlementCurrency`, `sourceAmount`, `sourceCurrency`, and a crucial `fxRateAppliedTimestamp` in ISO 8601 format. Our Spring Boot-based `settlement-event-processor` will be reconfigured to poll this endpoint for settled transactions. In the event of an API timeout (threshold set to 650ms) or a non-200 HTTP response, the system will implement an exponential backoff strategy and log a critical error to our centralized ELK stack. Transactions that fail API-based reconciliation after three retries will be flagged with a new internal status code, `RECON_API_FALLBACK_MANUAL`, for priority handling.","Immediate action is required from the core payments engineering team. A proof-of-concept must be developed in the UAT environment to validate the `settlementDetails_v3` API's performance and data integrity against a sample set of historical multi-currency transactions. The primary success metric is a 90% reduction in `ERR_RECON_FX_MISMATCH` alerts and a complete elimination of manual adjustments for FX-related settlement variances by the end of the next quarter. As the business owner, I will coordinate with our counterparts at ICICI Bank to secure the UAT API credentials and a complete OpenAPI specification document.

The current Kafka consumer configuration is too aggressive, leading to dropped sessions when processing batches from ICICI's Forex API (`icici-fcy-settlement-v2`). I am proposing we increase `max.poll.interval.ms` to 450000 (from 300000) and `session.timeout.ms` to 30000 (from 10000) for the `settlement-mc-consumer-group`. This adjustment will provide sufficient buffer for the JVM garbage collection pauses observed under load, preventing unnecessary rebalancing and subsequent processing delays that are currently impacting हमारे p99 latency targets.","To enhance monitoring granularity, a new Prometheus metric, `juspay_mc_settlement_forex_api_latency_seconds`, will be deployed to specifically track call durations to the ICICI endpoint. An alert will be configured in Alertmanager to fire if the p99 latency for this metric exceeds 450ms for a sustained 5-minute period. We must also introduce a targeted retry mechanism for a recurring transient error, `ICICI-ERR-503-FXRATE-UNAVAILABLE`. The proposed logic is an exponential backoff retry strategy (1s, 2s, 4s) for this specific code, failing to a dead-letter queue (DLQ) named `icici-fx-rate-dlq` after the third attempt. This prevents indefinite retries from blocking the consumer partition while allowing for automated recovery from temporary rate-service unavailability at the vendor's end.","Immediate action is to apply these Kafka consumer configuration changes to a dedicated feature branch and deploy them to the `pre-prod` Kubernetes namespace. A new load test profile will be created in Gatling to simulate peak forex volatility, targeting 1.5x our current peak TPS (approx. 1083 TPS). This test must validate that the p99 latency remains below 450ms and that no `ICICI-ERR-503` messages are lost, instead being correctly routed to the DLQ after exhausting retries.

Building on the data from file f2b99f5c105d4d3c, I need to flag an urgent issue that has emerged from our ongoing PCI DSS audit concerning the RBI Cross-Border Reporting implementation with ICICI Bank.\n\nThe auditors have identified a critical finding related to our authentication mechanism. Specifically, the JWT tokens generated for authenticating with ICICI's `/v1/rbi/crossborder/report` endpoint currently have a 24-hour expiry. This is a direct and non-negotiable violation of PCI DSS Requirement 8.2.4, which mandates stricter session controls and re-authentication. The auditor is firm on requiring a maximum token lifespan of 15 minutes.\n\nI’ve logged this formally in JIRA PAY-6659. Failure to remediate this will result in a major compliance finding, jeopardizing our certification and putting the entire Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603 at risk. I'm quite concerned about the tight deadline the auditors have imposed for our remediation plan.\n\nI understand that modifying our OAuth 2.0 flow to support shorter-lived tokens is not trivial. Our Grafana dashboards show the P99 latency for this API call is already hovering around 450ms. Introducing a more frequent token refresh cycle could add significant overhead, especially during peak volumes where we see up to 15,000 TPS. We must ensure this change doesn't degrade our settlement reconciliation performance or push our API error rate above the 0.5% threshold defined in our SLA.\n\nTo move forward, could you please take ownership of the following action items:\n\n1.  **Feasibility Analysis:** Investigate and confirm the technical path to reduce the JWT token lifespan to 15 minutes for this specific ICICI endpoint.\n2.  **Performance Modeling:** Analyze the potential impact on our auth service and Kubernetes pod resources. We need to know what the added latency will be and if we need to scale up infrastructure.\n3.  **Remediation Plan:** Provide a high-level technical plan and a reliable ETA for deploying this fix to the staging environment for validation.\n\nThe auditors expect a formal response with a concrete plan by Friday.

Building on your analysis in email dc711a0b157b478e, I’ve spent the morning digging into the root cause, and my findings confirm our suspicions.\n\nThe issue is a significant spike in false positives originating from our fraud detection model for cross-border transactions processed via ICICI Bank. Our false positive rate, which normally hovers around 0.8%, has jumped to 4.5% over the last 48 hours. This is obviously unsustainable and is putting a major strain on the ops team, not to mention creating friction for legitimate customers.\n\nHere’s a technical breakdown:\n\n• **Monitoring & Logs:** Our primary 'Cross-Border Fraud Analytics' Grafana dashboard shows a clear correlation between the rollout of the latest model ruleset last Tuesday and the increase in flagged transactions. Kibana queries on the transaction logs (`index: payment_logs_* AND payment_gateway:ICICI AND fraud_flag:true AND manual_review_outcome:approved`) confirm that rule `FRD-CB-007` (Transaction Velocity/Geo-Mismatch) is firing excessively.\n\n• **Performance Impact:** While the fraud check service latency is still within its 150ms P99 SLA, the sheer volume of flagged transactions is creating a backlog. This is putting our T+1 settlement target with ICICI at risk, as manual reviews must be completed before the cutoff. This directly impacts our compliance for the RBI mandate as part of Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603.\n\n• **Hypothesis:** My initial thought is that the model's feature weighting for new merchant categories in the EU is overly sensitive, possibly due to insufficient training data in the pre-production environment. The patterns don't align with the typical fraud vectors detailed in file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c.\n\nI’ve captured all these details in JIRA PAY-8190.\n\nTo get this under control, here are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Aditya:** Can your team please initiate a rollback of the `FRD-CB-007` rule to the previous version via the CI/CD pipeline for the fraud service? Post-rollback, we need an urgent analysis of the model's feature sensitivity and a plan to retrain it with a more diverse dataset from our staging environment. Let's aim to have a hotfix ready for testing by EOD tomorrow.\n\n2.  **Myself:** I will schedule a call with our technical contacts at ICICI Bank for tomorrow afternoon. I want to explore if we can get additional data points through their APIs (e.g., device fingerprinting or historical transaction context) to enrich our requests and improve model accuracy. This could be a longer-term fix.\n\nLet's connect for a quick 15-minute sync this afternoon to align on the rollback plan. The operational overhead is becoming critical, and we need to mitigate the impact on our reporting SLAs immediately.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAnjali Patel"],"timestamp":1757912100000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","aditya.singh@juspay.in","neha.gupta@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"]}},

Following up on that, our engineering team has conducted a more thorough investigation into the performance degradation we're seeing, and I'm a bit concerned about the findings.\n\nSince your core banking system migration last week, we've observed a critical performance bottleneck that is impacting the RBI Cross-Border Reporting flow for work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603. Our Grafana dashboards show that the P99 latency for API calls to your `/v2/transactions/report` endpoint has degraded significantly, moving from a stable ~400ms pre-migration to consistent spikes between 1.9s and 2.5s.\n\nThis increased latency is causing a cascade of issues. We're seeing a sharp rise in our error rate, from an acceptable 0.15% to nearly 4.0%, predominantly consisting of `504 Gateway Timeout` errors. We've traced this in our Kibana logs, and the timeouts are originating from your API gateway, not from within our infrastructure. Our Kubernetes pods for the settlement service are operating well within their CPU and memory limits, and horizontal scaling has shown no improvement, which strongly points to a capacity or processing bottleneck on your new backend.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, this is becoming a serious challenge. These timeouts are creating reconciliation failures in our T+1 settlement system, requiring manual intervention which isn't sustainable. More importantly, this instability puts our ability to meet the RBI's reporting mandate in jeopardy. As detailed in the project plan (Doc#f2b99f5c105d4d3c), we cannot proceed to the final UAT phase with this level of performance.\n\nWe have logged this issue formally under JIRA PAY-7944. To get to a resolution quickly, could you please facilitate the following?\n\n1.  **Provide the Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** from your side regarding the latency in the new core banking system.\n2.  **Organize a joint debugging session** between our SRE lead, Priya Nair, and your infrastructure/API team. We need to trace the request lifecycle end-to-end.\n3.  **Share performance metrics** (latency, throughput, error rates) from your load balancers and application servers for the affected endpoints during peak load tests.\n\nWe need to get to the bottom of this urgently to keep the project on track.

My findings confirm we are being significantly throttled by ICICI Bank's reporting API, which is a critical blocker for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting Mandate implementation (Work ID: c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nHere’s a summary of the technical situation:\n\nDuring our latest load test in the staging environment, any requests to ICICI's `/v2/transactions/report` endpoint beyond ~200 TPS are met with HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` errors. Our Grafana dashboard ('ICICI-CrossBorder-Health') shows our transaction processing rate flatlines at this limit, while our target throughput to meet compliance SLAs is 850 TPS. This resulted in an error rate spike to 14% during the test window, composed almost entirely of these `429` responses.\n\nI've double-checked our implementation: our OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow and JWT token management are functioning within spec. The p99 latency for successful requests is stable at ~600ms, so the underlying API performance is not the issue—it's strictly a server-side rate limit. I've documented the request/response patterns in Kibana and attached the analysis to JIRA PAY-5824 for detailed review.\n\nThis bottleneck makes it impossible to guarantee timely reporting and puts us at serious risk of failing to meet the RBI's T+1 settlement reporting deadline. We've implemented exponential backoff and jitter on our retry mechanism, but this is a temporary fix that only reduces error noise while further degrading overall throughput.\n\nCould we please formally request that the ICICI team provide the following information urgently?\n1.  Confirmation of the current TPS and daily quota limits configured for our production client ID.\n2.  The official process to request an increase. We require a sustained rate of at least 1,000 TPS to ensure an adequate operational buffer.\n\nIt might also be worth revisiting the initial discussion from `email#dc711a0b157b478e` to see if a bulk reporting or file-based SFTP alternative exists, as was briefly mentioned in the preliminary spec (ref: `file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c`).\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed with the escalation.

Building on your initial analysis in email 407576a2298c4954, I've done a deeper dive from a compliance and system-wide perspective.\n\nThis latency spike in the real-time risk scoring engine is quite concerning. Our Grafana dashboards confirm your findings, showing P99 latency for the `/v2/risk/score` endpoint jumping from our acceptable baseline of ~180ms to sustained periods of over 2.2s between 14:10 and 14:45 IST. This is well outside our internal SLA of 400ms and critically impacts our ability to meet the RBI's real-time reporting mandate for cross-border transactions under Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, any processing delay that pushes the transaction assessment beyond the RBI's prescribed window could result in a breach. During the spike, we saw a corresponding 0.8% increase in `T5` (Transaction Timeout) errors from the ICICI Bank gateway, which suggests we are already failing some transactions due to this latency. This not only affects customer experience but also creates a significant audit trail risk.\n\nI've been digging through the Kibana logs for the affected Kubernetes pods and, like you, I don't see any obvious authentication failures in the OAuth 2.0 flow or issues with JWT token generation. My initial suspicion was a bottleneck there, but the logs seem clean. However, I did find a correlation with increased DB query times on our transaction history table, which aligns with the hypothesis we discussed in relation to `file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c`. This seems like the most probable root cause at the moment.\n\nI've updated JIRA PAY-1348 with these observations and attached relevant log snippets. \n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **DBA Team:** Can you please investigate the query performance for the risk scoring engine's primary read replica?

Building on your analysis in email 744e97d4b6184cb5, my team has done a deeper dive into the KYC automation failures we're seeing for high-risk customer segments.\n\nFrankly, the situation is a bit more concerning than we initially thought. Our Risk & Ops Grafana dashboard shows a sharp spike in KYC failures over the last 72 hours, specifically for transactions flagged by our internal fraud detection engine. The success rate for this cohort has plummeted from our baseline of 98.5% to just under 30%, which is creating a significant operational backlog and putting our compliance posture at risk for the RBI mandate.\n\nOur engineers have traced the issue to the ICICI `/v2/customer/kyc/verify` endpoint. Looking at our Kibana logs, we're consistently receiving an HTTP `422 Unprocessable Entity` response for these specific API calls. The response payload contains the error code `E408` with the description \"Enhanced Due Diligence data missing or invalid.\" This affects all requests where our `additional_risk_factors` object is populated, which is mandatory for this segment.\n\nWhat's puzzling is that we haven't deployed any changes to our KYC service or the payload structure in the last two weeks. The implementation still conforms to the specification defined in `file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c`, which was signed off during the final UAT phase. The average latency for these failed requests is also climbing, hovering around 2.5s before timing out, compared to the usual P99 of ~450ms for successful verifications.\n\nThis is a critical blocker for the overall project (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603). The manual verification fallback is not scalable and compromises the automated audit trail we need for RBI reporting.\n\nCould your team please take the following actions with some urgency?\n\n1.  **Investigate Server-Side Logs:** Can you please examine your backend logs for requests from our production IPs that resulted in the `E408` error?

Yesterday’s batch alone had a discrepancy impacting 3,120 transactions. Our internal investigation, tracked under JIRA PAY-8759, points to a specific scenario with purpose code modifications. When we trace the problematic transaction IDs through our Kibana logs (sample set provided in file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c), we see they all involve a post-authorization update to the transaction's purpose code. Our UPI gateway captures the initial code at the time of payment, but it seems the final settlement record from NPCI, which we receive from your system, contains the updated code. This is causing a hash mismatch in our automated reconciliation service, flagging these as exceptions.\n\nThis is becoming a blocker for us, as our current reporting submission to your `/v1/crossborder/settlement/report` endpoint is built on the initial, immutable transaction data, as we had aligned on in our earlier discussion (ref: email#dc711a0b157b478e). The API itself is performing well, with p99 latency around 480ms, but this data discrepancy is preventing us from achieving full automation.\n\nTo resolve this, could your team please clarify the expected behavior? \n1.

Regarding the critical PCI audit finding you highlighted in email e4c9e5d4f31a4ba9, I've completed an initial investigation and have a clear path forward.\n\nThis issue directly impacts the RBI Cross-Border Reporting Mandate Implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603) and our integration with ICICI Bank. I've created a high-priority ticket to track this remediation effort under JIRA PAY-2281.\n\n**Investigation Summary:**\nThe audit finding is correct. Our cross-border reporting microservice is logging unmasked PAN fragments within exception stack traces. This occurs specifically when it receives intermittent `502 Bad Gateway` errors from ICICI's `/v2/reports/submit` endpoint. I've analyzed our Kibana logs (Index: `payment-gateway-prod-*`) and confirmed the behavior. While the overall error rate for this endpoint is low, averaging 0.15% with a P99 latency of 1800ms, any failure currently triggers this logging behavior, which is a clear violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 (Render PAN unreadable anywhere it is stored).\n\nThe root cause is our current error handling logic, which serializes the entire request object for logging upon a failed API call. Our Grafana dashboards for the reporting service's Kubernetes pods show stable resource utilization, confirming this is a code-level issue, not a performance bottleneck.\n\n**Proposed Remediation Plan:**\nI have a two-pronged approach to address this with urgency:\n\n1.  **Immediate Hotfix (Tactical):** I am preparing a hotfix that introduces a pre-serialization filter into our shared logging library. This filter will use regex to identify and redact PAN-like data patterns from any object before it is written to logs. My goal is to deploy this to our staging environment by 5 PM IST today for verification.\n\n2.  **Permanent Solution (Strategic - JIRA PAY-2281):** The long-term fix involves refactoring the error handling module to construct a custom, sanitized error object for logging. This object will explicitly exclude the raw request payload and only contain necessary, non-sensitive metadata for debugging. This will prevent any future recurrence.\n\nI reviewed ICICI's API specification document (file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c) and our prior technical sync detailed in email dc711a0b157b478e. Their API contract does not require us to log the full request, confirming this is an internal implementation gap on our end.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n*   **Arjun Mehta (Me):** Deploy the logging hotfix to staging by EOD today. Coordinate with QA for an expedited review, targeting a production deployment by tomorrow, 12 PM IST.\n*   **Sneha Patel (cc'd):** Please begin the design for the permanent code refactoring as outlined in JIRA PAY-2281.\n*   **Aditya Singh (You):** Request your review and formal approval for this immediate action plan. Your sign-off is the final gate for the production hotfix deployment tomorrow.\n\nThis is certainly a high-pressure situation given the audit timeline, but the hotfix will mitigate the immediate compliance risk and give us the breathing room to implement the robust, permanent solution.

Building on your analysis in email d2e661a0c6da4c9e, I've done a deeper dive from a risk and operations perspective, and I'm growing concerned about the impact on our RBI Cross-Border Reporting implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nThe latency spike in our real-time risk scoring engine is more severe than we initially thought. Our primary Grafana dashboard shows P99 latency for the scoring service hitting 2.1s between 14:30 and 15:00 IST today, a significant deviation from our baseline of ~150ms. This directly breaches the 500ms SLA we committed to in our technical specification (ref: file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c) and puts our compliance reporting at risk.\n\nDrilling down into the Kibana logs for that period, I'm seeing a correlated increase in `504 Gateway Timeout` errors originating from the `risk-scoring-service` pods. It doesn't appear to be a network-level issue with the ICICI API endpoint, but rather a bottleneck within our own processing stack. The transaction volume was high (~80K TPS) but not unprecedented. My hypothesis is that we are either facing resource starvation on the Kubernetes nodes running the scoring service or encountering contention in the backing Postgres database during peak write loads for audit logging.\n\nAs you know, the RBI mandate requires us to append a risk score to each cross-border transaction report in near real-time. Delays of this magnitude could cause us to miss the reporting window, leading to failed transactions or, worse, compliance breaches.

Building on the data from email 1f34731538ad4600, our team has performed a deeper investigation, and I have to admit, the situation is more critical than we initially thought.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards are showing a persistent spike in transaction declines originating from your fraud detection API endpoint. Over the last 48 hours in the UAT environment, the false positive rate has surged to an alarming 4.5%. For context, our agreed-upon threshold for this integration is below 0.5% to ensure a smooth user experience. This is directly blocking our progress on JIRA PAY-8586, which tracks the end-to-end reporting flow.\n\nOur engineering lead, Priya, has analyzed the Kibana logs and confirmed that legitimate transactions with valid RBI purpose codes (e.g., P0101 for software consulting, P0802 for travel) are being incorrectly assigned risk scores between 0.85 and 0.95. This is causing our payment orchestration layer to automatically reject them, preventing us from completing the settlement and reporting cycle tests. As you can imagine, a 4.5% false positive rate in production would be catastrophic for our GTV and customer trust, undermining the very goal of this mandate.\n\nGiven our tight deadline for the RBI mandate implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603), we're in a bit of a tight spot here. This issue has become the primary blocker for our UAT sign-off.\n\nCould your team please provide an urgent RCA on this? Specifically, we need to understand:\n1. Were there any recent changes or updates deployed to the fraud detection model in your sandbox environment?\n2.

Building on your initial analysis in email e1aa33ccc8704cbb, I've spent the last couple of hours digging into the latency spikes in our real-time risk scoring engine for the ICICI cross-border integration.\n\nMy findings confirm your suspicions. Looking at our Grafana 'Cross-Border Tx Latency' dashboard, I can see the P99 latency for the `risk-scoring-engine` service intermittently jumping from our baseline of ~250ms to as high as 2.1s, starting around 14:30 IST today. After pulling trace IDs from Kibana for transactions with elevated processing times, the bottleneck is clearly the OAuth 2.0 token refresh calls to ICICI's `/token` endpoint. Our custom metric `icici_auth_token_refresh_duration_ms` directly correlates with these latency spikes, pointing to a performance degradation on their side.\n\nWhile we aren't seeing a significant increase in HTTP 5xx errors from their end, our service's circuit breaker is tripping due to timeouts, which triggers retries and further degrades performance. This is a bit concerning as it pushes our overall transaction latency well above the 1.5s internal SLA we have for this flow (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603) and could jeopardize our ability to meet the T+0 reporting requirement for the RBI mandate. This vendor API instability was a risk we highlighted in the initial architecture review, detailed in `file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c`.\n\nAs a temporary mitigation, I've deployed a hotfix to our Kubernetes cluster, increasing the HTTP client's connection timeout for the ICICI token service from 1s to 3s. This should prevent our service from timing out prematurely and give their API more buffer. I have also adjusted the corresponding Prometheus alert to trigger if P99 latency holds above 1.8s for more than 5 minutes.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **[For Aditya]** Could the core services team look into implementing a more resilient caching strategy for these JWTs? A 30-minute TTL seems too short given this instability. A proactive refresh or a more robust fallback mechanism might be necessary.\n2.  **[For Priya]** We need to formally escalate this to our technical contacts at ICICI Bank. The performance of their `/token` endpoint is not acceptable for a real-time payment flow. Please raise a high-priority ticket with them, referencing our findings. The full investigation is documented in JIRA PAY-4462.\n\nI will continue to monitor the dashboards closely.

Your analysis of the settlement API response times was very helpful.\n\nBuilding on that, I’ve spent the morning digging into the compliance side of this UPI settlement mismatch for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603, and I'm a bit concerned. The deadline for the RBI mandate is approaching, and these discrepancies could put our reporting accuracy at risk.\n\nI cross-referenced our transaction logs from the Kibana `payments-prod` index for the last 48 hours against the T+1 settlement files we received from ICICI's SFTP server (specifically `ICICI_UPI_SETTLE_20241022.csv` and `_20241023.csv`). The mismatch is consistent at around a 0.75% failure rate in reconciliation, primarily impacting transactions that occur between 23:30 and 00:00 IST.\n\nFrom what I can see in the Grafana dashboard, our UPI gateway is processing these transactions successfully (p99 latency is stable at ~250ms), and we are receiving a success confirmation from the NPCI network. However, these specific transactions are not appearing in the corresponding T+1 settlement file from ICICI. Instead, they seem to be either dropped or pushed to the T+2 file without the required `purpose_code` and `remitter_country` fields, which is a direct violation of the reporting format specified in the mandate.\n\nThis looks like it might be a cutoff timing issue on ICICI's end, or their settlement batch job is failing to correctly parse transactions with specific metadata flags we're passing via the `/payments/v2/upi/create` endpoint. I've documented the full technical findings and attached a list of sample `juspay_tx_id`s that failed reconciliation to JIRA PAY-3568. This builds on the initial data you shared in `file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c`.\n\nCould you please have the engineering team prioritize this? Specifically, can we:\n1.  Trace the full lifecycle of a few of the failed transaction IDs I've flagged in JIRA to confirm the payload we are sending to ICICI's API is correct.\n2.  Check if there are any error codes or timeouts being logged on our side when communicating with their settlement reporting webhook. We need to rule out any issues with our OAuth token refresh flow.\n\nI’m escalating this internally as a P1 compliance risk. I think our next step should be a joint debugging call with ICICI's technical team by EOD tomorrow. I can coordinate that, but I'll need your team's support to present the logs and data.

Building on your analysis in email 824b68b33ad743a8, I've investigated further and can confirm our assumptions. We are indeed being rate-limited by ICICI's cross-border reporting endpoint.\n\nThis is becoming a critical bottleneck for the RBI mandate implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603), and I'm a bit concerned about our ability to meet the compliance deadline if this persists.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of what I'm seeing:\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\n*   **Endpoint:** The issue is specific to ICICI's `/v2/crossborder/report_transaction` endpoint.\n*   **Error Code & Rate:** We are consistently receiving `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` responses once our transaction volume exceeds approximately 50 TPS. Our Grafana dashboard 'ICICI-Gateway-Health' shows a direct correlation between this error rate (now peaking at 4.5%) and our transaction throughput during peak hours (14:00-16:00 IST).\n*   **Performance Impact:** The throttling is causing significant queuing on our side. The p99 latency for our reporting service has degraded from a baseline of ~300ms to over 2.1s as our Kubernetes-based retry mechanism kicks in. This isn't sustainable.\n*   **Logs:** Kibana logs from our `reporting-aggregator` service confirm that our system is healthy and scaling as expected. The bottleneck is external. I’ve attached a log sample showing the 429 errors in `file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c` for detailed review.\n\n**Compliance & Business Impact:**\n\nThe RBI mandate requires near real-time reporting. This throttling is creating a backlog that pushes our reporting delay beyond the acceptable T+5 minute window. This poses a direct compliance risk. Furthermore, the operations team is flagging reconciliation discrepancies due to these delayed and failed reports, creating manual overhead.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **ICICI Rate Limit Increase (Urgent):** We need to formally request ICICI to increase our API rate limit. Based on our current projections, we require a sustained capacity of at least 250 TPS with the ability to burst to 400 TPS. This was part of our initial technical discussion with them, as documented in email dc711a0b157b478e.\n\n2.  **JIRA Ticket:** I have updated JIRA PAY-4293 with these findings and have escalated its priority to Highest. All further technical updates will be tracked there.\n\n3.  **Communication:** I will reach out to our primary technical contact at ICICI Bank, Mr. Sharma, with a formal request referencing our agreement and the critical nature of this issue. My goal is to get a confirmation and an ETA for the fix by EOD tomorrow.\n\nLet's connect tomorrow at 10:00 AM for a quick sync on their response.

I've reviewed the proposed SFTP-based batch reporting flow detailed in file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c, and I need to raise a critical point regarding its operational viability for our multi-currency settlement optimization.\n\nWhile the batch approach covers the basic reporting requirements, it introduces a significant latency—potentially T+1 or T+2—into our reconciliation cycle. Our internal settlement engine, HyperSettle, is built on an event-driven architecture designed for near real-time processing. Our current domestic reconciliation latency, monitored via Grafana, is consistently under 180ms at P99, even during peak loads of 40,000 TPS. Shifting to a batch file dependency for cross-border transactions would degrade this performance drastically and require significant manual overhead, which is a step backward for us.\n\nFor the RBI Cross-Border Mandate (Work ID: c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603), our primary goal is not just compliance but also maintaining a robust, auditable, and efficient system. A delayed reconciliation process increases fraud risk and complicates dispute resolution, undermining the spirit of the mandate. As we discussed in our earlier conversation (ref: email#dc711a0b157b478e), a real-time notification mechanism is essential.\n\nWe strongly propose implementing a secure API webhook from ICICI's end. When a settlement status is updated, your system would trigger a POST request to a dedicated Juspay endpoint (e.g., `https://api.juspay.in/v3/callbacks/icici/settlement`). Authentication can be managed using the same OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow and JWT tokens we use for our payment initiation APIs. This would allow us to ingest settlement data directly into our Kafka pipeline, reconcile within minutes, and maintain a seamless process that scales with our transaction volume. This also ensures that our Kibana logs for audit purposes are populated in near real-time.\n\nI’ve updated the technical requirements in JIRA PAY-3932 to reflect this as a critical path item. Could your engineering team please re-evaluate the feasibility of providing real-time settlement notifications? The approaching deadline adds a bit of urgency here, and I'm concerned that a batch-based solution will cause significant integration challenges on our end.\n\nLet's schedule a 30-minute technical sync this week with our respective engineering leads to finalize the API contract.

This was definitely a serious flag, and we treated it with the highest urgency.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis (RCA) & Impact:**\n\nThe finding was correct. Our new cross-border reporting service, specifically the module handling transaction failures with ICICI Bank, was inadvertently logging unmasked PAN data in debug-level logs. This occurred only under a specific condition: when our call to ICICI's `/v2/crossborder/report` endpoint resulted in a timeout or a `503 Service Unavailable` error. The custom exception handler in that code path was bypassing our standard log-masking interceptor.\n\nI’ve analyzed the Kibana logs on our primary Elasticsearch cluster. The issue was confined to our staging environment (`k8s-cluster-staging-02`). We found approximately 212 log entries over the past 5 days containing sensitive data. Thankfully, production was not affected, as the feature flag for this new reporting flow is still disabled there. No sensitive data was ever transmitted to ICICI or any other external system; the exposure was limited to our internal staging logs.\n\n**Immediate Remediation Actions (Completed):**\n\n1.  **Hotfix Deployed:** As of 03:15 AM IST, we deployed a hotfix to the staging environment that monkey-patches the logging function to enforce masking globally within that service, effectively stopping the data leak.\n2.  **Log Purge:** We have purged the affected log indices from our staging Elasticsearch cluster. The data is now irrecoverable, and we've confirmed this with the SRE team. A ticket was raised for this (JIRA PAY-7982) and is now resolved.\n\n**Permanent Fix & Next Steps:**\n\nThe permanent solution involves refactoring the error handling module to correctly chain into our core logging framework, ensuring compliance with the data handling policies outlined in file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c. \n\n*   **Code Fix:** The dev team has already submitted a merge request. I am personally reviewing it now to ensure it covers all edge cases. \n*   **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement:** I'm adding a new step to our CI pipeline that uses a regex-based linter to scan for potential logging of PCI-sensitive data patterns before any deployment can proceed. This should prevent a recurrence.\n*   **Monitoring:** I've configured a new alert in Grafana to trigger if any log message matching a PAN data structure is ever detected in any environment, with a high-priority page to the on-call engineer.\n\nWe are targeting deployment of the permanent fix to the staging environment by 6 PM IST today. After QA sign-off, we will be ready for a production release, though this is less critical given the feature is not yet live. This incident will not impact the overall project timeline for the RBI mandate implementation.\n\nI’ll schedule a brief post-mortem for tomorrow to walk through the technical details and the new preventative measures.

Building on your analysis in email 34ad0181805a46a1, I've completed a deeper investigation into the PCI compliance finding related to our ICICI cross-border reporting implementation.\n\nThis is unfortunately a critical issue. The audit has identified a violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 concerning the protection of PAN data. My investigation, tracked under JIRA PAY-2228, confirms that our `CrossBorderReportingService` is logging unencrypted PAN and other PII to our Kibana cluster before transmitting the data to ICICI's `/v2/forex/reporting` endpoint.\n\nHere are the specifics:\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The service logs the entire inbound transaction payload at the INFO level for debugging purposes. This payload contains the `customer.identity` object, which includes the unmasked PAN. This happens in the `processTransaction` method before any encryption or masking is applied.\n*   **Evidence:** I have verified this by inspecting logs from the `k8s-staging-payment-services` cluster. Log entries from pods like `pod-cross-border-reporting-svc-789cbf...` clearly show the full, unredacted PII. Our Grafana dashboards show normal API performance (P99 latency at ~450ms, error rate <0.2%), as this is a data-handling flaw, not a functional error.\n*   **Impact:** This is a high-severity audit finding. Failure to remediate this immediately could jeopardize our upcoming PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AoC) and violates the data security protocols detailed in our internal policy, file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c.\n\nWe need to action a two-part remediation plan with some urgency:\n\n1.  **Immediate Containment (by EOD today):** As a temporary measure, we must update the logging configuration for the `CrossBorderReportingService` in the production environment to disable INFO-level logging. This will stop the immediate data exposure but is not a permanent solution.\n2.  **Permanent Fix (Targeting Staging by EOD Wednesday):** The engineering team needs to implement a data-masking utility within the service. The `customer.identity` field within the payload object must be passed through a masking function before any log write operation. This function should redact sensitive fields, leaving only non-sensitive identifiers (e.g., last four digits of PAN: `XXXX-XXXX-1234`). It is critical that this masking only applies to the logging and *not* the data being transmitted to ICICI Bank via their API, to avoid reconciliation failures on their end.\n\nOnce the fix is deployed to the staging environment, I will need to perform a validation check on the Kibana logs to confirm that PII is properly masked. We will also need to execute a full regression test to ensure end-to-end data integrity for the reporting flow.\n\nGiven the audit timeline, this is a top priority. Can you please assign ownership of JIRA PAY-2228 and confirm if the engineering team can meet these timelines?

Building on your analysis in email 3f0797d393c6460c, I’ve done a deeper dive into the KYC automation issue we're facing for the RBI Cross-Border reporting project.\n\nThe situation is a bit more concerning than I initially thought. Our automated KYC process is failing for a significant portion of customers classified as 'high-risk' by our internal fraud detection system. Looking at the metrics from the last 12 hours, we're seeing a failure rate of approximately 12.5% for this specific segment. This is a critical blocker for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603 and jeopardizes our ability to meet the regulatory deadline.\n\nI've been reviewing the Kibana logs (query linked in JIRA PAY-9192) and traced the root cause to ICICI Bank’s `/v2/customer/enhanced-due-diligence` API endpoint. For standard transactions, the API performs well within the 400ms range. However, for transactions where our request payload includes the `risk_tier: 'HIGH'` attribute in the JWT, the P99 latency is spiking to over 2800ms. Our current service-level timeout is configured at 2.0s, leading to a cascade of `504 Gateway Timeout` errors. The API spec we received (file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c) clearly states a sub-800ms SLA, which is not being met for these enhanced checks.\n\nOperationally, this means every failed transaction has to be routed for manual verification, which is completely unsustainable and opens us up to compliance risks and audit findings. We cannot proceed with the production rollout with this manual process in place.\n\nTo move forward, here are the immediate next steps:\n\n1.  **Rohan (ICICI Bank):** Could your team please urgently investigate the performance degradation on the `/v2/customer/enhanced-due-diligence` endpoint when processing requests with the high-risk flag? We need to understand if this is a resource allocation issue on your end or if the payload is being processed inefficiently.

While not a fix, it could mitigate the immediate transaction drops. Please also prioritize creating a dedicated Grafana dashboard to monitor latency and `5xx` error rates for this high-risk user segment exclusively.\n\nI've updated JIRA PAY-9192 with these findings and have also referenced the earlier analysis from email dc711a0b157b478e.

We are receiving a `SUCCESS` status from the NPCI network, and the API response times are well within our SLA (averaging 210ms). There are no corresponding error codes on our end.\n\n2.  **Settlement File Discrepancy**: The problem appears to originate in the T+1 settlement file generation process on your end. The batch files we receive via SFTP are consistently missing a specific subset of successful transaction IDs. We've cross-referenced this with the initial list from email dc711a0b157b478e and the pattern is the same.\n\n3.  **Potential Root Cause**: We suspect the issue might be linked to how your backend system processes and aggregates transactions with the new RBI-mandated `purpose_code` field. Our API calls to your `/v2/payments/initiate` endpoint are correctly formatted with these codes, as per the spec outlined in Doc#74dccffb0b134f5f. It seems these specific transactions are not being correctly ingested by your settlement batch job.\n\nWe have logged all technical details, including sample `juspay_txn_id`s, API payloads, and log snippets from our end, in JIRA PAY-8726 for your team to review.\n\nTo move forward, could you please have your technical team take the following actions?\n\n*   **Investigate the settlement batch processing logic** for transactions containing cross-border purpose codes.\n*   **Verify the data pipeline** between your primary transaction database and the system that generates the settlement reports. Are there any silent failures or filtering rules that might be excluding these transactions?\n\nI’ve attached an updated list of missing transaction IDs from the last 24 hours in file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c for your immediate analysis. Resolving this is our highest priority, and I’m feeling the pressure to get this sorted before our next report to the regulators.\n\nLet’s set up a quick 30-minute sync call with our respective engineering leads tomorrow to debug this live. Please let me know what time works best for you.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRohit"],"timestamp":1757915400000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["ankit.verma@icicibank.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on your observations in email 74dccffb0b134f5f, I’ve spent the morning investigating the KYC automation failures for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting project (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nHere's a summary of what I've found:\n\nThe issue is specific to customer segments our internal risk engine flags as 'high-risk'. For standard profiles, the KYC flow via ICICI's API is performing within expected parameters, with a 99.2% success rate and p95 latency of 250ms. However, for this high-risk cohort, the automated KYC process is failing at a rate of approximately 18.5%, which is well outside our error budget and a serious blocker.\n\nDrilling down into the logs on Kibana for our `kyc-orchestrator` service in the staging environment, I can see that our calls to ICICI Bank's `/v2/customer/enhanced-due-diligence` endpoint are consistently returning an `HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity` status. The response body contains the error code `IC_VALIDATION_ERR_05` with the message \"Additional documentation required for high-risk profile.\"\n\nThis is a bit frustrating, as this specific requirement wasn't detailed in the API specification document (file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c) we received from them. It seems that for these specific user profiles, their system is rejecting standard e-KYC data and implicitly demanding a different set of documents or data fields which we are not currently sending. The p99 latency for these failed API calls is also spiking to ~2.2s, likely due to their system running extra validation logic before ultimately rejecting the request.\n\nThis is a critical issue that jeopardizes our UAT and the overall project timeline. The manual fallback is not a scalable solution and introduces compliance risks.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **[Priya]** Could you please escalate this immediately with our technical counterparts at ICICI Bank? We need an urgent clarification on the exact payload structure and documentation requirements for their enhanced due diligence flow. We need to know what data fields trigger this `IC_VALIDATION_ERR_05` and what the expected inputs are.\n2.  **[Arjun - Done]** I have created and documented all these findings, including correlation IDs and sample failed request payloads, in JIRA ticket PAY-6199 for tracking.\n3.  **[Compliance Team]** As per the discussion in email dc711a0b157b478e, I'm looping in Sameer to ensure that any new data points we might need to collect and send are compliant with our own data privacy and SOC 2 policies.\n\nOnce we have the updated specifications from ICICI, I anticipate the development effort on our side to be minimal—likely a configuration change in the `kyc-orchestrator` service. We should be able to deploy a fix to the staging environment within 48 hours of receiving the required information.\n\nLet me know if you need any more technical data from my end for the discussion with ICICI.\n\nBest regards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757915580000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["priya.sharma@juspay.in"],"cc":["ravi.kumar@juspay.in","sameer.verma@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"]}},

Building on your analysis in email 343aa785cddd45e6, I’ve been digging into the performance degradation since the new fraud detection model was deployed for the RBI cross-border reporting mandate (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nThe situation is a bit more concerning than we initially thought. The false positive rate has jumped from a manageable 0.8% to an alarming 4.5% over the last 12 hours. Our Grafana dashboards are lighting up, showing a massive spike in transactions being declined with the internal code `FRAUD_SUSPECTED` (710). This is causing a direct impact on our GTV and, more importantly, a terrible customer experience.\n\nI've correlated this with Kibana logs from the `fraud-detection-service` running in our Kubernetes cluster. The logs confirm the new model is overly aggressive, particularly with transactions originating from SE Asia and affecting merchants with historically high-velocity, low-value transaction patterns. This is putting a significant strain on our manual review queue, and we're at risk of breaching our internal operational SLAs.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, while we must be robust in fraud detection for the RBI mandate, this level of disruption is a major business risk. It undermines the very goal of facilitating smooth cross-border payments. The analysis summary in file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c confirms that the rule weights for certain merchant category codes are far too sensitive.\n\nOne thing I noticed is a potential discrepancy in the data we're receiving from ICICI Bank. Are we certain their reporting API is sending all the specified data points, particularly device fingerprinting and behavioral metrics? A missing field could easily cause the model to default to a higher risk score.\n\nHere are the immediate action items I've outlined in JIRA PAY-2468:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Rohan):** Please coordinate a temporary rollback of the fraud model to the previous stable version (v1.2) in our staging environment immediately. We need to re-establish a baseline before we push any further changes to production.\n2.  **Data Science Team:** Begin an emergency recalibration of the new model (v1.3). Focus on tuning the thresholds for rule sets R-105 (Geolocation Mismatch) and R-112 (Velocity Check), as these appear to be the primary drivers of the false positives.\n3.  **Myself/BizDev:** I will schedule a high-priority call with our technical counterparts at ICICI Bank by EOD tomorrow to audit the data stream from their reporting API endpoint. We must validate every field against our integration spec.\n\nThis is becoming a critical blocker for the project, and we need to move quickly.

Following up on your message from this morning (ref: email ba2805150b2b4682), our team has completed a deeper investigation into the transaction submission failures.\n\nOur production monitoring has confirmed that we are consistently hitting a rate limit on the `/v2/transactions/report` endpoint. We are seeing a high volume of HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` errors originating from the ICICI API gateway, which is severely impacting our reporting throughput for the RBI Cross-Border mandate (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nHere are the specific metrics from our Grafana dashboards over the last 6 hours:\n*   **Observed Rate Limit:** Capped at approximately 200 TPS.\n*   **Required Throughput:** Our system needs to support a sustained 800 TPS, with peak loads reaching 1,200 TPS during business hours to meet reporting SLAs.\n*   **Error Rate Spike:** The rate limiting is causing the error rate for this specific API call to spike to 4.5%, creating a significant backlog in our reporting queue. This is well above our internal 0.5% error budget.\n*   **P99 Latency:** For the requests that do succeed, latency is acceptable at ~450ms, confirming the issue is throttling, not performance degradation.\n\nWe have already ruled out issues on our end. Our Kubernetes cluster is scaling our reporting service pods correctly, and Kibana logs show that our OAuth 2.0 authentication flow and JWT token generation are functioning without errors. The bottleneck is definitively at the API gateway. We are tracking this critical issue internally under JIRA PAY-3484.\n\nAs you know, the RBI mandate is our highest priority, and this bottleneck poses a direct risk to our compliance deadline. The throughput requirements were outlined in our initial technical specification document (referenced in our previous conversation, email dc711a0b157b478e, and file f2b99f5c105d4d3c).\n\nTo resolve this immediately, we have two urgent requests:\n1.  Can your team please investigate and confirm the currently configured rate limits for our client ID on the production environment?\n2.  We need the limit for the `/v2/transactions/report` endpoint increased to at least 1,500 TPS to provide a safe operational buffer and allow us to clear the processing backlog.\n\nGiven the urgency, could you please provide an ETA for this change? We ideally need this resolved within the next 24 hours to mitigate any further compliance risk.\n\nAppreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

To be frank, the situation is a bit more critical than we initially thought.\n\nBetween 14:30 and 16:00 IST yesterday, we observed a significant spike in transaction failures for payments being routed through ICICI. Our Grafana dashboards show the error rate for your `v2/payments/cross-border` endpoint jumping from our typical baseline of 0.2% to a sustained 4.5%.

This error is occurring for transactions that previously processed without issue. We've verified that our OAuth 2.0 token generation and JWT signing process are functioning correctly, with p99 latency holding steady at ~180ms. The issue appears to be isolated to the transaction processing leg after successful authentication.\n\nOur working hypothesis, which is also tracked in JIRA PAY-2101, is that a recent configuration change on your backend related to the new RBI purpose codes might be the root cause. This aligns with the implementation plan we discussed (ref: email#dc711a0b157b478e) and the technical specifications in file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c. It seems as though the routing rules associated with our merchant ID (JUSPAY_IN_PROD) may not have been updated correctly to handle the new set of codes.\n\nGiven that we're approaching the final RBI mandate deadline, resolving this is our highest priority for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n1.  **ICICI Team:** Can you please have your technical team urgently investigate the routing table configurations for our merchant ID?

Building on your findings in email 22375fecf7dc41eb, I've done a deeper dive from a compliance and reporting perspective regarding the ICICI Bank settlement mismatch.\n\nThis reconciliation gap is becoming a critical issue for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting mandate implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603). My main concern is that if we can't achieve 100% reconciliation, our automated reporting to the regulatory bodies will be inaccurate, which is a significant compliance risk.\n\nI cross-referenced our Kibana logs with the T+1 settlement file from ICICI (file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c) for yesterday's transactions. The data confirms your observation: we are seeing a discrepancy of approximately 0.35% of the total transaction volume, which maps to 872 transactions. These are transactions that our UPI gateway processed successfully (receiving a 200 OK from ICICI's inbound API) but are completely absent from their settlement report. As tracked in JIRA PAY-3460, this is not an isolated incident.\n\nThe Grafana dashboard for the ICICI gateway shows a healthy state – P99 latency is holding steady at ~450ms and the error rate is below 0.2%, with no unusual spikes in 4xx or 5xx error codes from their end. This strongly suggests the issue is not with the transaction authorization flow via NPCI but rather with ICICI's internal settlement batch processing logic.\n\nDigging into the logs for the missing transactions, a pattern emerges. It appears that transactions where the `purposeCode` field contains alphanumeric values (e.g., 'P1302-EDU') are the ones being dropped. Transactions with purely numeric codes are reconciling correctly. This seems to contradict their API specification document (Doc#029304bf139046df), which states support for alphanumeric purpose codes as per the latest RBI circular. This was also a point of discussion in our earlier sync, referenced in email#dc711a0b157b478e.\n\nWith the final implementation deadline just weeks away, we can't afford to go live with this ambiguity. The integrity of our audit logs and regulatory reports is paramount.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Rohan:** Can you please initiate a high-priority ticket with the ICICI tech team? We need them to investigate their settlement processing logic and confirm if there's an undocumented validation rule that rejects alphanumeric `purposeCode` values post-authorization. Please attach the logs for the 872 transaction IDs I've compiled in the sheet linked within JIRA PAY-3460.\n\n2.  **Myself:** I will escalate this with our relationship manager and compliance counterparts at ICICI, framing it as a direct blocker for the RBI mandate.\n\nI'm a little concerned about their turnaround time. Could we, in parallel, scope out a short-term mitigation in our staging environment? Perhaps we can configure our system to flag these specific transactions and route them through a separate, manual reconciliation process for now. It's not ideal, but it would prevent our primary reporting from failing.\n\nLet's connect tomorrow morning to discuss their response.\n\nBest,\n\nPriya"],"timestamp":1757916540000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.mehta@juspay.in","aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on your analysis in email 029304bf139046df, my team has completed a deeper investigation into the UPI settlement mismatch for the T+1 cycle from May 14th.\n\nWe've identified a discrepancy of INR 4,21,570.00 across 87 transactions that were marked as successful in our system but are missing from the final settlement report provided by ICICI (ref file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c). This is obviously a major concern for us, especially with the strict reporting deadlines under the RBI mandate for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603.\n\nHere’s a summary of our findings:\n\n1.  **Log Analysis**: Our Kibana logs for the UPI gateway confirm that for each of the missing `juspay_txn_id`s, we received a `STATUS: SUCCESS` response from the NPCI network. The callbacks were processed correctly, and our system updated the transaction state accordingly. There are no corresponding error codes (like U30 or RB) on our end.\n\n2.  **Performance Metrics**: I've reviewed our Grafana dashboards for the period in question. API latency on the `/payments/v2/charge` endpoint to ICICI remained stable, averaging 180ms with a p99 of 250ms. The overall transaction success rate was 99.7%, with no anomalous error spikes that would indicate a failure on our side. The OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow with your servers also performed as expected.\n\n3.  **Cross-Verification**: We have pulled a sample of these transactions and verified their successful status directly via the NPCI portal. This confirms the issue is not with the transaction processing itself but seems to be located within the post-transaction reconciliation or reporting pipeline on ICICI’s end.\n\nThis pattern feels similar to the issue we flagged in email dc711a0b157b478e a few months back.

When our system attempts to use a valid `refresh_token` to acquire a new `access_token`, we are sporadically receiving an `invalid_grant` error. This directly causes `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` responses on subsequent calls to the `/v2/reporting/cross-border/submit` endpoint, leading to transaction processing timeouts.\n\nThe operational impact is becoming severe. Our Grafana dashboards show the p99 latency for this API spiking from a baseline of ~450ms to over 2.5s during these failure windows. The error rate has jumped from our acceptable threshold of <0.1% to nearly 4.5% in the last 24 hours. This data is also reflected in the analysis from our prior email dc711a0b157b478e.

We're observing a significant spike in latency for their `/v2/reports/generate` endpoint, which is critical for this mandate.\n\nHere are the key findings:\n\n*   **Performance Metrics:** Our Grafana dashboards show the P99 latency has jumped from a baseline of ~450ms to over 2.2s during peak load tests in our staging environment. This is drastically outside our agreed-upon SLA of 800ms. Error rates are intermittently spiking to 3.5%, primarily `503 Service Unavailable`.\n\n*   **Log Analysis:** Kibana logs confirm a pattern of timeouts originating from the ICICI gateway, particularly when our reporting service attempts to fetch transaction details in batches larger than 500. This directly contradicts the assurance in email dc711a0b157b478e that the new system would handle up to 200 TPS for this flow; we're seeing it falter at just 80-90 TPS.\n\n*   **Root Cause Hypothesis:** The issue appears to be twofold. First, the database queries on their migrated system seem un-indexed for the batch transaction lookups we require, as outlined in the spec Doc#82154a802d714de2. Second, their OAuth 2.0 token validation layer is adding an extra ~300ms of overhead per request. Our tracing indicates their JWT token introspection is the specific sub-process causing this delay.\n\nThis is a serious concern as it directly impacts our ability to meet the T+1 reporting deadline mandated by the RBI. At the current rate, generating the daily report could take over 6 hours, which is unacceptable and risks a compliance breach.\n\nI have updated JIRA ticket PAY-7576 with detailed logs and the performance graphs from Grafana. This includes the comparison data from file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c which shows the pre-migration baseline.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **ICICI Team:** Can you please provide a formal RCA for the query performance and the OAuth token introspection latency? We need a concrete mitigation plan by EOD Tuesday.\n2.  **Arjun (Juspay):** I will deploy a temporary workaround on our side by reducing the batch size to 250 and implementing a more aggressive retry mechanism with exponential backoff. This is a stop-gap measure that will increase our Kubernetes pod utilization but should keep us compliant in the immediate short term.\n\nWe need to schedule a joint debugging session with the ICICI engineering team for tomorrow to review their logs in real-time. I'll ask Sneha to coordinate a time slot.\n\nLet's get this resolved quickly. The deadline is non-negotiable, and we're running out of buffer.\n\nRegards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757917320000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","icici-integration-team@juspay.in","sneha.kapoor@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

While I agree that reviewing the full transaction lifecycle is important, our investigation points to a more specific issue in the settlement reconciliation phase.\n\nFollowing up on the UPI payment reconciliation discrepancies for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting project (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603), we've completed a deeper analysis. We're consistently seeing a settlement mismatch of approximately 0.18% between our reconciled transaction data and the T+1 settlement file (ref: file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c) provided by ICICI Bank. This issue is being tracked internally under JIRA PAY-8049.\n\nOur team has been monitoring this on our 'RBI-Recon-ICICI' Grafana dashboard. The discrepancies are almost exclusively tied to transactions that initially receive a timeout response from the NPCI network but are subsequently confirmed as successful via our status check polling on your `/v3/upi/transaction/status` endpoint. I've cross-referenced a sample of these transaction IDs in our Kibana logs, and our system correctly marks them as 'SUCCESS' with an average finalization latency of 1.2s post-timeout. However, these specific transactions consistently fail to appear in your settlement report for that day.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is a significant concern. An incomplete settlement report compromises the integrity of the data we are required to submit under the new mandate. We cannot move forward with our parallel run submission until this data gap is closed, and the deadline is fast approaching.\n\nOur current hypothesis, building on the framework we established in Doc#44d02d3d441f4ad9, is that your settlement generation batch job may be finalizing its dataset before our final status updates are ingested, thereby incorrectly flagging these late-settled transactions as failed or pending. As you know, the RBI guidelines require reporting based on the final, immutable state of the transaction within the T+1 window, regardless of intermediate states.\n\nCould your team please investigate the execution timing and logic of your settlement report generation process? Specifically, we need you to verify the final state of the transaction IDs I shared in my previous email (ref: dc711a0b157b478e) within your core banking system and confirm why they were excluded from the settlement file.\n\nWe need to get to the bottom of this by tomorrow, EOD. I've asked Aditya Singh from our payments engineering team to be on standby. Would you be open to a joint debugging session tomorrow morning to go over the logs from both sides if your initial investigation doesn't reveal the cause?\n\nAppreciate your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":1757917620000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.verma@icicibank.com"],"cc":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","compliance.team@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Following up on that, our security and engineering teams have completed a deeper analysis of the critical PCI compliance finding flagged by our QSA.\n\nThe issue, now tracked internally as JIRA PAY-4722, points to potential unmasked PAN data logging within the ICICI environment for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting mandate (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603). Our investigation suggests this occurs specifically in error recovery scenarios related to the `icici/v1/cross-border/report` batch submission endpoint. While our outbound payloads from our Kubernetes processing pods are fully compliant and tokenized, we suspect that upon receiving an intermittent HTTP 503 or a timeout, your system may be logging the full raw request payload upon a successful subsequent retry. This is a direct violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4.\n\nOur Kibana logs show that for the ~50,000 daily transactions in this batch, we see this pattern occur at a rate of ~0.15%. While the error rate itself is low, any plaintext logging of PAN is a zero-tolerance finding for our audit. The full auditor's note is available in Doc#983540569880498e, and I've also attached a sanitized log sample as file#f2b99f5c105d4d3c for your reference. This ties back to the concern Aditya raised in email dc711a0b157b478e about JWT token refresh behavior, as a failed token refresh could be a potential trigger for the initial 503 from your gateway.\n\nThis is our highest priority risk item, as it directly jeopardizes our upcoming PCI DSS certification. We need your team to take the following actions with urgency:\n\n1.  **[ICICI Bank]** Please investigate the server-side logging configuration for the `cross-border/report` endpoint, particularly for requests that fail initially and then succeed on retry. We need confirmation on whether full, unmasked request bodies are being logged in any scenario.\n2.  **[ICICI Bank]** Provide a root cause analysis (RCA) and a remediation plan with a firm timeline for deployment to production.\n\nWe need to provide an update to our auditors within 48 hours. Could you please provide an initial assessment by EOD tomorrow? Internally, Aditya's team is already scoping a temporary request-side data redaction layer, but this is a stopgap measure and not a substitute for a fix on your end.\n\nLet me know if a call tomorrow morning would be more efficient to sync up on this. \n\nBest regards,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757917740000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","vikram.mehta@icicibank.com"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["vikram.mehta@icicibank.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

We've been seeing a discrepancy rate of ~0.02% since the last deployment (ID: deploy-prod-pg-78c5d1a), which is directly impacting the accuracy of our daily cross-border reporting data for the RBI.\n\nMy initial investigation using the 'Payments-Recon' Grafana dashboard shows no packet loss or API errors from our payment-gateway service. However, running a query on the `euler_ledger_transactions` dataset in BigQuery and joining it with ICICI's daily settlement file shows missing `bank_ref_num` values for a small but consistent set of VPA transactions. The pattern seems to point to transactions processed between 2-4 AM IST, which I believe aligns with ICICI's internal batch processing window. My theory is that there's an edge case in how their system handles late-night settlements before the daily report file is generated.\n\nProposed Agenda & Actions:\n1.  **Validation:** Vikram, can you please check from your side if there's a different batch process or a known issue with `bank_ref_num` population for UPI transactions that are settled during this 2-4 AM window? \n2.  **Interim Fix:** Rahul, let's discuss the feasibility of a temporary reconciliation script. I'm thinking it could flag transactions with a missing `bank_ref_num`, wait an hour, and then re-query ICICI's transaction status API (get_txn_details_v2). This would be a short-term patch to unblock our reporting.\n3.  **Long-Term Solution:** We need to decide on the best long-term fix. Should we push for the `bank_ref_num` to be included in the primary settlement file, or request a supplementary correction file? Ananya, we'll need your guidance on which approach is more compliant with the RBI mandate.\n\n**Action Items:**\n*   **AI-1:** Vikram (ICICI) to investigate internal batch processing logic for `bank_ref_num`. ETA: 24 hours.\n*   **AI-2:** Rahul (Juspay) to scope the interim retry script and document it in a new Confluence page under PAY-9755. ETA: EOD Tuesday.\n*   **AI-3:** Priya (Juspay) to update the project's Risk Register based on this discussion.

Our Grafana dashboard (CrossBorder-KYC-Monitor) shows the failure rate for the `FOREIGN_NATIONAL_HIGH_NET_WORTH` segment jumped from ~2% to over 35% since the `ff-reporting-v2-payload` feature flag was enabled. Our Hyper SDK is consistently logging a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response with error code `EKYC_903_INVALID_RISK_CATEGORY` from ICICI's UAT endpoint. This is blocking our pre-prod testing for the RBI mandate.\n\nMy initial thought is that there might be a mismatch in the enum value we're sending in the `customerRiskProfile` field. The Confluence spec doc (CB-Reporting-API-v2.1) suggests it should be a string, but maybe the recent update to the Fraud Detection Engine's output format is causing an issue. I checked the staging deployment `pay-svc-stg-a93b01c`, and the generated payloads look correct on our side, but something is clearly getting lost in translation to the ICICI gateway. We need to confirm the exact request/response payloads and align with ICICI.\n\nProposed agenda & goals:\n1.  **Live Debug (15 min):** Rahul, can you walk us through a failed transaction in Kibana and show the request payload generated by our KYC service?\n2.  **ICICI Spec Review (20 min):** Rajesh, can you confirm the expected format and valid enums for the `customerRiskProfile` and related fields on ICICI's side? It would be great if you could share a sample successful request for this user segment from your logs.\n3.  **Action Plan (25 min):** Decide on a fix. Is it a simple config change in our service, or does it require a code change and a new deployment? We need a clear path forward to unblock testing by EOD Friday.\n\nAnjali, please keep us honest on the compliance side – if we implement a temporary fix, what are the documentation requirements?

The current error rate is causing a significant backlog in our Kafka topic (`cb-reporting-queue`) and puts our T+1 reporting SLA at risk. The goal of this session was to align on a concrete mitigation strategy and assign clear action items.\n\nQuick summary of what we've observed: our `cross-border-reporter` service is hitting the rate limit wall primarily during the nightly batch processing window. The Grafana dashboard shows a clear correlation between our job execution and a spike in `429`s, with p99 latency on their `reportTransaction` endpoint jumping from ~450ms to over 1.2s. Priya's initial analysis, which we discussed, confirmed our current naive retry logic is likely exacerbating the issue by creating a thundering herd problem. We need to get this under control before it triggers a full-blown compliance incident.\n\nBased on the discussion, here is the proposed path forward and confirmed action items:\n1.  **Technical Fix:** Priya's team will implement an exponential backoff with jitter strategy in the reporter service's API client. This was agreed as the most robust immediate fix. A follow-on ticket will be created to add a circuit breaker pattern (using our internal 'resilience4j' library) to protect the system from getting overwhelmed long-term. **Owner:** Priya Sharma. **ETA (backoff):** End of next sprint (3 days). **ETA (circuit breaker):** TBD.\n2.  **Vendor Action:** Vikram confirmed he will escalate our request internally at ICICI.

The auditor flagged that our `cross-border-reporting-scheduler` service account has overly broad IAM permissions, specifically `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` on a project level, which violates the principle of least privilege (PCI DSS Req 7.2.2). This technically gives it access beyond the required BigQuery dataset for the RBI report, including indirect access pathways to production Euler ledger replicas. We cannot proceed with the go-live until this is closed.\n\nMy initial analysis on the staging environment confirms the finding. The current role grants `bigquery.dataEditor` on the entire project dataset. The service only needs read-only access to a specific BQ view (`vw_rbi_crossborder_txns_final`). The risk here is clear – a compromise of this service account could lead to data modification or exfiltration of sensitive transactional data. Slack discussions have been helpful, but we need to lock in a technical solution now.\n\nHere’s the proposed agenda for our sync:\n1.  **Quick Review (5 min):** Recap of the auditor's exact finding and its impact.\n2.  **Proposed Fix (25 min):** I've drafted a new custom IAM role (`roles/crossBorderReportingViewer`) with only `bigquery.tables.getData` and `bigquery.jobs.create` permissions, scoped strictly to the `vw_rbi_crossborder_txns_final` view. We'll walk through the Terraform definition for this change. I think this is the cleanest path forward.\n3.  **Impact & Testing (15 min):** Can we validate if this limited permission set breaks any dependent jobs or downstream processes for ICICI? Priya, your input here is critical. We'll need to run a full test cycle in pre-prod with the new role.\n4.  **Action Items & Timeline (15 min):** Define clear owners and ETAs for implementation, testing, and providing evidence back to the auditors. My goal is to have the PR for the IAM change raised by EOD tomorrow.\n\nkeywords: PCI DSS, IAM, least privilege, BigQuery, compliance, security audit, PAY-7919, RBI reporting","status":"confirmed","createdAt":1757925259083,"updatedAt":1757925259083,"app":"google-calendar","entity":"event","creator":{"displayName":"Arjun Mehta","email":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in"},"startTime":1757940600000,"endTime":1757944200000,"joiningLink":"https://meet.google.com/qwe-rtyu-iop","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.sharma@juspay.in","rohan.verma@juspay.in","sunita.patel@juspay.in"]}},

P99 latency has surged from a baseline of ~120ms to over 1100ms, coinciding with a 15% spike in `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` errors. Our Grafana dashboards indicate that the `reporting-gateway` service is exhausting its PostgreSQL connection pool, suggesting write contention as it attempts to log transaction states before forwarding them to ICICI's endpoints. This behavior was not present during UAT and points to a production environment configuration mismatch on the vendor side.","Analysis of network traces shows that the time-to-first-byte (TTFB) from ICICI's new API gateway has degraded significantly. It appears their backend is now performing synchronous database commits for each reporting entry, whereas the previous system likely used an asynchronous queuing mechanism. This change is causing back-pressure on our Kafka topic `icici-rbi-fema-stream`, with consumer lag now exceeding 2 million messages. This is a direct violation of the sub-500ms latency stipulated in our partner SLA (Section 4.2b). The immediate risk is data loss and falling out of compliance with the T+1 reporting window mandated by RBI.","Immediate action: I am implementing a temporary client-side throttling mechanism within the `reporting-gateway` using a token bucket algorithm (configured to 50 TPS) to prevent cascading failures to upstream services. Concurrently, I've opened a high-priority ticket with ICICI's integration team (Ref: ICICI-T9834-A) to investigate the synchronous commit behavior on their Finacle instance. Recommendation: Propose a shift to a batch submission model via their SFTP channel as a fallback, while we work with them to re-establish acceptable real-time performance.

Log aggregation via Splunk confirms our `x-border-reporter` service receives a `401 Unauthorized` response, but the subsequent call to the token refresh endpoint is timing out. This results in a failure to post transaction data, directly jeopardizing our compliance with the RBI's real-time reporting mandate. The failure rate spikes to 12% during peak international transaction windows (04:00-07:00 UTC), corresponding with a P99 latency increase from a 220ms baseline to over 3500ms for the reporting job.","The core issue is a flawed assumption in our reactive token refresh logic. The current implementation, triggered by a `401`, does not account for ICICI's auth server policy, which appears to invalidate the `refresh_token` after a single failed refresh attempt. Intermittent network congestion between our VPC and ICICI's infrastructure is causing these initial refresh calls to fail, leading to a permanent lockout state until a new token is manually generated. This constitutes an unacceptable single point of failure for a critical compliance workflow. Grafana dashboards for the `x-border-reporter` service show a direct correlation between `HTTP-504` spikes and subsequent alerts for failed RBI submissions.","Immediate action requires implementing a proactive, stateful token management strategy. We recommend modifying the `x-border-reporter` service to run a scheduled background task that refreshes the access token 15 minutes before its 'expires_in' value dictates. The refreshed token and its new expiry will be stored in our shared Redis cluster (redis-c1-shared.juspay.internal). This preemptive approach decouples the authentication lifecycle from the time-sensitive reporting API call.

Frankly, the situation is becoming critical from a regulatory standpoint.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards are showing P99 latency for the `/v2/reporting/submitTransaction` endpoint spiking to over 2500ms, which directly correlates with the token refresh cycle. This is causing widespread `HTTP 408` timeouts. The error rate for these specific API calls has jumped from our baseline of 0.2% to nearly 4.5% over the last 12 hours, which is well outside our SLA of 99.95% uptime.\n\nLooking at the Kibana logs, the root cause appears to be our service failing to preemptively use the refresh token before the primary JWT access token expires. We're seeing a flood of `401 Unauthorized` errors from ICICI's gateway, which our retry mechanism is unable to recover from, eventually leading to the timeout. This isn't just a performance degradation; it's a hard failure in our reporting pipeline for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603.\n\nEvery failed submission batch puts us at risk of missing the RBI's T+1 reporting deadline.

Building on the initial alert from your email (1b5f22de924c41f7), my team has conducted a preliminary investigation into the latency spike observed in our real-time risk scoring engine for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting Mandate implementation with ICICI Bank (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nThe situation is more concerning than initially thought. Our primary Grafana dashboard (`payments-latency`) confirms that the P99 latency for our internal `/v1/transactions/score` endpoint has degraded from a stable baseline of ~150ms to sustained peaks of 2.1s - 2.5s over the last 12 hours. This is causing a direct increase in our transaction timeout rate to 1.8%, which is well above our 0.2% tolerance and jeopardizes our ability to meet the stringent reporting timelines mandated by the RBI.\n\nI've analyzed the Kibana logs for the corresponding trace IDs, and our internal service-to-service calls within the Kubernetes cluster appear healthy, with response times remaining within the expected 20-30ms range. The bottleneck seems to be localized to the synchronous outbound API call our scoring engine makes to ICICI's new pre-transaction validation endpoint, `/v1/crossborder/report`. Log analysis (see attached export file#8f4619b333d84b20) shows that the response times from this specific ICICI endpoint are averaging around 1.9s.\n\nFrankly, a ~2-second latency for a mandatory, synchronous validation step is operationally untenable and was not anticipated based on the performance metrics shared by ICICI during UAT. This issue is now our highest priority for the Risk & Ops team. I have updated the JIRA ticket PAY-2579 with these findings.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Anjali (self-assigned):** I am escalating this formally with our Technical Account Manager at ICICI Bank, citing the performance deviation from our agreed-upon SLA. I will be requesting an urgent RCA and a remediation plan from their end.\n2.  **Aditya (SRE):** Can you please double-check our egress controller and firewall configurations for the traffic to ICICI's IP range?

Building on your points from email af21de763e194c6f, our team has performed a deeper investigation into the cross-border payment routing errors, and the findings are a bit concerning.\n\nSince approximately 11:30 AM IST, we've observed a sharp increase in transaction failures for international payments being routed through the ICICI gateway in our staging environment. Our primary Grafana dashboard shows the error rate for your `/v2/payments/initiate` endpoint spiking from a baseline of 0.2% to a sustained 4.8% for all non-INR transactions. This is well outside our acceptable threshold and is preventing any further UAT progress.\n\nOur engineering lead, Priya, has examined the Kibana logs and confirmed that the majority of these failures are returning an `HTTP 502 Bad Gateway`. A significant subset of these failed responses contains the error code `GW-CONF-ERR-03 (Invalid Routing Config)`, which strongly suggests a configuration issue on your side. The request payloads themselves are correctly structured as per the API specification outlined in `file#8f4619b333d84b20`. The p99 latency has also degraded from our usual ~450ms to over 2200ms, triggering timeouts in our upstream services.\n\nAs this is directly tied to the RBI Cross-Border Reporting Mandate implementation (Work ID: c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603), this instability puts our go-live timeline at significant risk. We have logged this as a critical issue in JIRA PAY-8314 for formal tracking.\n\nTo move forward, we have the following action items:\n\n1.  **ICICI Bank Team (Owner: Sunil):** Please immediately investigate the routing rules and configuration for our merchant ID (`JUSPAY-CBE-9876`) in your staging environment.

Our Grafana dashboards show that p99 latency for the reporting submission service is spiking from our usual baseline of ~250ms to over 2.5 seconds during these incidents. This directly correlates with an increase in 5xx errors from our side, but the origin is not within our cluster.\n\nDigging into the Kibana logs for our Kubernetes pods, I’m seeing that our client fails to get a new token from ICICI's endpoint (`https://api.icicibank.com/oauth/token`) due to connection timeouts. Our service then attempts to use the existing, now-expired JWT to call the actual reporting endpoint (`/v2/reporting/submit`), which correctly returns a `401 Unauthorized`. This failure cascade is pushing our effective error rate for this specific job to nearly 4.2%, which is alarmingly high and well outside our target SLA of <0.5%.\n\nThis feels very similar to the initial instability we saw a few weeks ago, as discussed in email thread 1b5f22de924c41f7. My working theory is that ICICI's auth service is unable to handle the burst of token refresh requests generated by our hourly batch processing, possibly due to rate limiting or resource contention on their end. This is a critical blocker; we are at significant risk of missing the RBI's T+1 reporting deadline.\n\nI have consolidated detailed logs and a performance graph into the primary JIRA ticket for this work, PAY-8124. I've also attached a filtered log file (ref: file#8f4619b333d84b20) to the ticket for their direct analysis.\n\n**Action Items:**\n1.  **[Owner: Aditya Singh]** Can you please escalate this immediately with our technical counterparts at ICICI?

We need an official RCA and confirmation that their authentication infrastructure is compliant with the performance requirements we agreed upon.\n2.  **[Owner: Arjun Mehta]** As a temporary mitigation, I am developing a patch to introduce a more aggressive proactive token refresh logic in our client. This will attempt to refresh the token 5 minutes before its expiry, outside the main transaction flow, to reduce contention. I plan to deploy this to our staging environment by EOD today for testing.\n\nWe need a formal commitment from ICICI on a fix.

We went from a healthy average of 180ms to sustained peaks of 2.1s - 2.5s yesterday between 15:00 and 15:45 IST. This is well outside our 400ms SLA for this service and directly impacts our ability to meet the RBI's T+0 reporting window.\n\nMy analysis, as detailed in the attached report (ref: file#8f4619b333d84b20), points to a database bottleneck rather than a network or auth issue. The OAuth 2.0 flow for generating JWT tokens for the ICICI gateway API is stable, adding only ~20ms. The issue appears to be originating from our PostgreSQL instance backing the fraud detection service. For certain high-value, multi-currency transactions, the feature-generation queries are exhibiting pathological performance, causing the Kubernetes pods for the risk engine to queue requests.\n\nSpecifically, logs show that queries joining transaction history with user profile data are taking upwards of 1.8s to execute. This only happens for users with extensive transaction histories, which aligns with the cross-border transaction profiles we were processing during the spike. This has a direct compliance impact; a delay of this magnitude could cause us to miss the reporting window to ICICI's `/rbi/v1/reportTransaction` endpoint, leading to reconciliation failures and potential regulatory penalties.\n\nI have updated JIRA PAY-7158 with these specific query details and log snippets.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Data Engineering (cc: Rahul):** Can you please analyze the slow query logs in JIRA PAY-7158? I suspect we may need to introduce a new composite index on the transactions table or explore refactoring the feature logic to be less query-intensive.\n2.  **SRE (cc: Sneha):** Could we lower the alerting threshold on the risk engine’s P99 latency in our alert management system?

This is an order of magnitude higher than our 0.3% baseline for other gateways and is causing significant operational strain. This directly impacts our GTV and puts the stability of the entire RBI Cross-Border Reporting mandate implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603) at risk.\n\nAfter reviewing the Kibana logs for the SentryShield service, I've noticed a pattern. A disproportionate number of transactions are being flagged with `FRAUD_RISK_HIGH` (triggered by Rule ID: `CS_INTL_Vel_003`) almost immediately after the OAuth 2.0 token exchange with ICICI's gateway. The issue appears to be with the feature vector enrichment process. The raw payloads from ICICI’s `/processTransaction` endpoint seem to be missing, or have malformed, `merchantCategoryCode` and `acquirerId` fields for certain transaction types. Our model is likely interpreting these null values as high-risk indicators, hence the velocity check is firing incorrectly. The analysis I've compiled in `file#8f4619b333d84b20` confirms this pattern across a sample of 500+ flagged transaction IDs.\n\nThis is creating a major backlog for my team who are now manually reviewing these flags to prevent legitimate customer transactions from being permanently blocked. This isn't sustainable, and it echoes the concerns about data inconsistencies first raised in `email#1b5f22de924c41f7` a couple of weeks ago.\n\nI have updated JIRA PAY-8866 with these specific findings and logs.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Rohan):** Can you please prioritize investigating the data mapping layer between the ICICI gateway API and the feature set being ingested by SentryShield?

Regarding that point, I need to raise a critical performance issue our team has identified.\n\nSince your team began the core banking system migration in the staging environment yesterday, we've seen a significant performance bottleneck impacting our integration for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting mandate (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603). This is becoming a serious concern for our go-live readiness.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards are showing a worrying trend. The P99 latency on the `/payments/v2/crossborder/authorize` endpoint has degraded from a baseline of ~450ms to over 2.2s. This is causing our load testing to fail, with TPS dropping below our target of 150 TPS and a corresponding spike in the error rate to 4.2%, mostly `504 Gateway Timeouts`. This directly threatens our ability to comply with the RBI's T+1 settlement cycle.\n\nOur engineering team is tracking this under JIRA PAY-4376. Initial analysis, which builds on the thread in email 1b5f22de924c41f7, suggests the bottleneck may be within the new system’s OAuth 2.0 flow during JWT validation, or perhaps a database contention issue under concurrent load. We've attached the relevant Kibana logs and trace IDs to the ticket for your team's reference, along with the performance report from file#8f4619b333d84b20.\n\nTo keep this project on track, we need your team's immediate support. Could you please:\n\n1.  Acknowledge this as a P0 issue and initiate an immediate investigation?\n2.  Provide us with a detailed Root Cause Analysis (RCA) by EOD tomorrow (Wednesday).\n3.  Schedule a joint debugging session between your core banking architects and our payments engineering team to troubleshoot this live.\n\nThis is a critical blocker for the project.

Building on your observations in email 7d67866543fa4f87, I've completed an initial investigation into the latency spike impacting our real-time risk scoring engine for the ICICI cross-border reporting project (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nMy findings confirm a significant performance issue. Here's a summary:\n\n**Performance Metrics Analysis:**\n*   **Latency:** Our Grafana dashboards for the `risk-engine-prod` service show P99 latency spiking from a healthy baseline of ~200ms to sustained peaks of over 2.1s. This occurred this morning between 09:30 and 11:00 IST.\n*   **Correlation:** The latency increase does not correlate with transaction volume. TPS was moderate at ~15k during the incident, well below our stress-tested limits. Error rates on our services remained stable at 0.3%, suggesting our internal systems are resilient but the user-facing experience is being impacted.\n\n**Root Cause Investigation:**\nI've traced the issue by analyzing logs in Kibana across the relevant Kubernetes pods. The bottleneck is originating from an external API call to ICICI Bank's UAT environment. Specifically, calls to their `enrichment-v2` endpoint are experiencing extreme latency. While our internal service-to-service communication is consistently under 15ms, the round-trip time for this external call is fluctuating wildly, with some requests taking up to 1.9s to complete. \n\nI’ve double-checked our implementation against the agreed-upon specs in file#8f4619b333d84b20 and the integration plan from email 1b5f22de924c41f7. Our OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow and JWT token management appear to be functioning correctly, with no authentication-related errors (4xx codes) observed. This strongly suggests the performance issue lies within the ICICI UAT infrastructure.\n\nThis is a critical blocker. A 2-second delay in risk scoring is unacceptable as it directly risks transaction timeouts in our UPI gateway and could compromise our ability to meet the strict real-time reporting SLAs under the RBI mandate.\n\n**Action Items:**\n1.  **Arjun (Me):** I have created JIRA ticket PAY-1494 to formally track this issue. I am compiling a detailed report with specific trace IDs, timestamps, and Grafana snapshots to share with the ICICI team.\n2.  **Priya/Sameer:** Could you please escalate this to our primary technical contact at ICICI Bank as a high-priority issue? They need to investigate the performance of their `enrichment-v2` endpoint immediately. The provided data should give them a clear starting point.\n\nWe need to get this resolved before we proceed with further UAT and production readiness sign-offs.

I've cross-referenced them with our compliance monitoring, and the situation with the KYC automation is more critical than we initially thought.\n\nBuilding on this analysis, the automated KYC process for high-risk customer segments under the RBI cross-border mandate is consistently failing. Our Grafana dashboard shows the KYC automation success rate for this cohort has dropped from a stable 98% to below 65% in the last 48 hours. This directly impacts our ability to meet the reporting timelines and is creating a significant backlog that the manual review team cannot sustain.\n\nThe logs confirm our services are correctly generating the OAuth 2.0 JWT token and initiating the request to ICICI's `/v2/kyc/verify` endpoint. However, we're seeing a spike in `502 Bad Gateway` responses from our side, which, after tracing the transaction IDs, corresponds to an undocumented `EKYC_403_RISK_FLAG` error in the response payload from ICICI’s staging environment. This error code is not mentioned in the API specification document (file#8f4619b333d84b20) provided by ICICI.\n\nMy hypothesis is that ICICI's risk engine is applying a stricter, secondary validation layer for profiles we've pre-categorized as 'high-risk', which our current API payload doesn't satisfy. This seems related to our earlier conversation about payload differences (ref: email#1b5f22de924c41f7), but we never received a clear directive on implementation.\n\nI’m getting quite concerned as this bottleneck puts our entire Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603 timeline in jeopardy. We absolutely must have this automated flow operating at a >99.5% success rate before the end of the month to be compliant.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **ICICI Team:** Can you please investigate the `EKYC_403_RISK_FLAG` error code?

We've reviewed our implementation based on your feedback, but our investigation continues to point toward the risk-scoring logic within the new fraud detection model.\n\nWe are seeing a sustained and frankly, concerning, spike in the false positive rate for international card-not-present transactions processed via the ICICI gateway. Our primary Grafana dashboard (CrossBorder-Fraud-Metrics) shows the rate has jumped from our baseline of ~0.5% to 4.2% over the last 48 hours. This isn't a minor fluctuation; it's a significant operational issue.\n\nTo quantify the impact, this has resulted in approximately 3,500 legitimate transactions being incorrectly flagged with error code `FR77` (High-Risk Transaction) in the last 24 hours. The issue is tracked under our internal JIRA ticket PAY-6878. This is causing a significant increase in manual review workload and, more importantly, customer drop-offs.\n\nOur engineering team has analyzed the Kibana logs for a sample set of flagged transaction IDs (summary attached in file#8f4619b333d84b20, building on my initial alert in email#1b5f22de924c41f7). We've confirmed the transaction payloads sent to your `/v2/risk/check` endpoint are correctly formatted per the API specification. Latency is also not a factor, with p99 response times holding steady at ~210ms.\n\nThe data strongly suggests that the model's rule set is overly aggressive for certain transaction patterns, particularly those originating from specific non-3DS European BINs.

Building on your summary in email e6d903366a7a4442, our team has performed a deeper dive into the cross-border payment routing errors.\n\nThe issue appears to be isolated to transactions with specific `purpose_code` values being processed under the RBI Mandate Implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603). Our Grafana dashboard is showing a consistent 4.2% failure rate for payments where the `purpose_code` is 'P0101' (Software Consulting). While API latency remains stable within our 800ms P99 SLA, the downstream reconciliation failures in our settlement system are becoming a critical concern.\n\nOur engineers have examined the Kibana logs (a sample trace ID has been attached to JIRA PAY-3593) and confirmed that your `POST /v1/crossborder/payments` endpoint returns a `200 OK`. However, our settlement reconciliation process, which runs at T+1, flags these transactions because the funds are being credited to the incorrect nostro account. This misrouting directly contradicts the mapping logic defined in the agreed-upon technical spec (file#8f4619b333d84b20) and is not an issue with our OAuth 2.0 flow, which remains stable.\n\nThis is a major compliance risk. The data integrity required for the RBI cross-border reporting is being compromised, which puts the entire project's deadline at risk. We have to treat this with the highest urgency.\n\nCould you please have your technical team immediately investigate the routing logic configured on the ICICI backend for these specific purpose codes?

Building on the initial alert from your email 400eeddc2e4145c8, I've spent the morning investigating the latency spike in our real-time risk scoring engine for the ICICI Bank integration.\n\nThis is related to the RBI Cross-Border Reporting Mandate Implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603), and I've tied all my findings to JIRA ticket PAY-9866.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\nI can confirm the issue. Our Grafana dashboards for the payment gateway showed our P99 latency for transactions routed via the new ICICI flow spiking from a baseline of ~180ms to as high as 2.1s yesterday between 14:30 and 15:15 IST. This is well outside our internal SLA of 500ms. The transaction volume was moderate, around 8.5K TPS, so this doesn't appear to be a load-induced problem on our end.\n\nDiving into the Kibana logs for the `icici-reporting-service`, I've isolated the delay to the synchronous API call we make to ICICI's reporting endpoint (`/v2/crossborder/reportTransaction`). Our internal risk scoring and data preparation complete within 45ms, but we're seeing a consistent wait time of 1.5-2.0s for the HTTP 200 OK response from ICICI's server. Our Kubernetes pod metrics show no CPU or memory pressure, just high I/O wait times, which points directly to this external dependency.\n\n**Root Cause Hypothesis:**\n\nMy primary hypothesis is that the bottleneck is within ICICI's infrastructure. Given that our OAuth 2.0 flow for generating the JWT bearer token is completing successfully in under 80ms, the issue is likely downstream from their API gateway. It could be related to their internal processing, database lookups, or the validation logic for the reporting data we send, as specified in the technical document (file#8f4619b333d84b20). We've previously discussed potential performance challenges with them in the context of the analysis from email 1b5f22de924c41f7.\n\nWhile this intermittent latency hasn't caused transaction timeouts yet, it's a significant risk. If this occurs during peak hours, it could lead to a cascading failure and impact our overall uptime SLA of 99.95%.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **[ICICI Bank] - URGENT:** We need ICICI's engineering team to investigate the server-side performance of their `/v2/crossborder/reportTransaction` endpoint for the time window mentioned above. They need to analyze their logs for the transaction IDs I am about to share with you separately via a secure channel. Please ask them to check for any slow database queries or service dependencies on their end.\n\n2.  **[Arjun Mehta - Done]:** I have updated JIRA PAY-9866 with detailed log snippets and links to the specific Grafana dashboard showing the latency deviation.\n\n3.  **[Arjun Mehta - In Progress]:** I am setting up more granular alerting to trigger if P99 latency for this specific service exceeds 750ms for more than 2 minutes. This will help us catch future occurrences faster.\n\nAditya, could you please escalate this with our technical counterparts at ICICI? This is a bit concerning given the mandate's approaching deadline, and we need their full attention to ensure a stable production environment.\n\nLet me know if they require any more data from our side.\n\nBest,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757914260000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on the initial analysis from your email (821580004f634e91), I've investigated the root cause, and it's a bit more concerning than we thought.\n\nThe issue is isolated to the ICICI Bank KYC automation flow, specifically for customer segments our internal risk engine flags as 'high-risk'. Our automated KYC attempts for these users are failing at an alarming rate. The Grafana dashboard for the KYC service shows our success rate for this cohort has plummeted to just 82.2% in the last 72 hours, which translates to a failure rate of 17.8%.\n\nI dug into the Kibana logs and found we are consistently receiving a `IC_KYC_403_RISK_PROFILE_MISMATCH` error from ICICI's `/v2/customer/ekyc/verify` endpoint. This isn't a standard auth failure; it's a business logic rejection. Latency is not an issue, holding steady at an average of 950ms, so this is purely a functional problem. My hypothesis is that a recent, and likely uncommunicated, change on ICICI's end has deprecated or altered the expected values for the `purpose_code` and `source_of_funds` fields we pass in the encrypted JWT payload for these specific risk profiles. The current implementation is based on their spec in file#8f4619b333d84b20.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is critical. This impacts Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603 directly. Each failure necessitates manual intervention, which is not only operationally taxing but also introduces a significant risk of us breaching the RBI's mandated T+1 reporting timeline. The lack of a clean, automated audit trail for these high-risk transactions is a major red flag.\n\nI've consolidated the failing trace IDs, our payload structure, and the corresponding error logs into JIRA PAY-7719 for tracking. \n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Engineering (cc: Rohan):** Can your team please urgently re-validate our payload generation logic against ICICI's most recent API documentation?

Building on the analysis from your email (2d337b70f1a3428e), I've investigated the throughput degradation for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nThe root cause is confirmed to be API rate limiting on ICICI Bank's side. Our reporting service is being throttled when calling their `/v2/transactions/crossborder/report` endpoint.\n\nHere are the specifics:\n\n*   **Problem:** During our peak settlement reconciliation window (approx. 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM IST), we are receiving a high volume of `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors. This is creating a significant backlog in our reporting message queue.\n*   **Performance Impact:** Our Grafana dashboard shows our service attempts to push reports at a necessary rate of ~450 TPS to meet compliance deadlines. However, we're being capped at what appears to be a consistent 100 TPS. This has pushed our API error rate for this specific service up to 18% during peak load, well above our 0.5% threshold. P99 latency, which is normally stable at ~400ms, is timing out after 2.5s for these throttled requests.\n*   **Verification:** I've confirmed this is not an issue with our internal systems. Our Kubernetes deployment has scaled correctly, our OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow is healthy, and JWT tokens are being refreshed without issue. Kibana logs with the query `kql: \"response.status: 429 and service.name: icici-reporting-connector\"` isolate the failures exclusively to this integration.\n\nThis bottleneck is a critical blocker. The current throughput is insufficient to clear our daily transaction volume, putting us at serious risk of failing to meet the RBI's T+1 reporting mandate. This issue is being formally tracked under JIRA ticket PAY-4206.\n\nAs you'll recall from our initial technical discussions (summarized in Doc#b9bdb929590f4651 and prior email 1b5f22de924c41f7), the system was scoped to handle up to 750 TPS to account for future growth. The current limit is untenable.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **[To ICICI Team]:** We urgently request that you investigate the rate-limiting profile for our API credentials and increase the throughput cap to a minimum of 600 TPS. \n2.  **[To ICICI Team]:** Can you please confirm if this is a shared or dedicated limit? We need clarity on the architecture to prevent future contention.\n\nWe need to get on a call with the ICICI technical team to resolve this immediately.

Building on your findings in email b9bdb929590f4651, the situation with the ICICI API timeouts is becoming a critical blocker for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting project (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, I'm getting quite concerned. These failures directly jeopardize our ability to meet the reporting SLAs mandated by the RBI. The intermittent nature of the OAuth token refresh failures is causing data submission gaps, which is a major red flag for our audit trail.\n\nHere’s a summary of the impact based on my review of the dashboards and logs:\n\n- **Technical Root Cause:** The primary issue appears to be intermittent timeouts when our payment gateway calls ICICI's `POST /oauth/token` endpoint to refresh the JWT access token. Our system is correctly initiating the refresh well within the token's expiry window.\n- **Performance Metrics:** Our Grafana monitoring shows the error rate for this specific API call spiking to 4.5% yesterday between 15:00 and 17:30 IST. This has a direct knock-on effect, pushing the p99 latency for our `submitCrossBorderTxn` API to over 2100ms, far exceeding our internal 450ms SLA.\n- **Log Analysis:** Kibana logs from our reporting service pods in the Kubernetes cluster confirm that our HTTP client is consistently receiving a `504 Gateway Timeout` after the 2-second connection timeout. This suggests the issue lies within ICICI's infrastructure, as we are not receiving any application-level error codes (e.g., 4xx or 5xx) from their end before the timeout occurs. The incident is being tracked under JIRA PAY-9890.\n\nWe have already ruled out any client-side misconfigurations. The OAuth 2.0 client logic is a standard implementation used across multiple banking integrations and has been stable. Network diagnostics also show no packet loss between our production environment and ICICI's ingress points.\n\nAs you noted, the engineering team has deployed a temporary retry mechanism, but this is not a viable long-term solution. It adds latency and puts unnecessary load on our infrastructure, which could impact other services.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Escalation with ICICI:** We need to formally escalate this with the ICICI technical team today. Please stress the compliance-critical nature of this project. They need to investigate their server-side logs for our requests to the `/oauth/token` endpoint and explain the timeouts.\n2.  **Request for ICICI's Metrics:** Can we request performance data from their side? Specifically, their own server-side processing latency for token refresh requests and any rate-limiting policies they have in place that we might be unknowingly triggering.\n\nI have referenced the detailed analysis in `file#8f4619b333d84b20` and our previous discussions in `email#1b5f22de924c41f7` to provide them with the full context. We need a definitive RCA and a permanent fix from their side within the next 48 hours.\n\nLet's schedule a call with them tomorrow to discuss their findings.

Building on your findings in email 6a7f1318c0d44857, the settlement mismatch with ICICI for cross-border UPI transactions is unfortunately persisting.\n\nOur Ops team has been manually reconciling the T+1 settlement files (ref: file#8f4619b333d84b20) against our internal transaction logs, and the discrepancy is holding steady at around 0.2% of the daily volume, impacting our float. The core issue, as you highlighted, seems to be with transactions that initially return a ‘pending’ status from the NPCI network.\n\nDiving deeper, I looked at our Grafana dashboards and Kibana logs for a specific set of these failed reconciliations. For instance, transaction ID `JPAY730650UPIXBDR` (INR 8,250) at 14:10 IST yesterday shows a successful `TXN_SUCCESS` status in our logs after an initial `TXN_PENDING`. However, it's completely missing from the EOD settlement file from ICICI. The latency for the final status update via their callback mechanism is averaging around 850ms, which is within the SLA, but the data just isn't making it into their final settlement batch.\n\nThis is becoming a serious compliance risk for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603. The RBI mandate requires that all reporting fields, including `purposeCode` and `remitterCountry`, are reconciled and reported within the T+1 window. This manual process is error-prone and frankly won't scale.\n\nI’ve updated JIRA PAY-8584 with these specifics and a few more transaction examples.\n\nAs a short-term mitigation, can we get a script running that pulls all transaction IDs marked as ‘pending’ reconciliation in our Hyperion settlement system and queries ICICI's `/v2/payments/status` endpoint for a final confirmation before we close our books at T+1? It’s a patch, I know, but we need to stop the bleeding.\n\nLonger-term, we need to push the ICICI team for an RCA. This smells like a race condition or a bug in how their system ingests asynchronous status updates into their batch settlement process. I'm a bit concerned about their system's reliability as we ramp up volume. This issue was also flagged in the past (ref: email#1b5f22de924c41f7), so it seems to be a recurring problem.\n\nI'm setting up a priority call with Mahesh and the technical team at ICICI for tomorrow morning.

Building on your last email (10bab2053dc6470c), I need to escalate an urgent issue regarding a PCI compliance audit finding that directly impacts our ongoing RBI Cross-Border Reporting Mandate implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nOur recent PCI DSS audit flagged a critical vulnerability related to the authentication flow for the cross-border reporting API. Specifically, the JWT access tokens generated by the ICICI auth server for our client ID have a 24-hour expiry. Our auditor has cited this as a direct violation of security best practices, referencing PCI DSS v4.0 Requirement 8.3.10, and has mandated a maximum token lifetime of 1 hour. You can find the exact excerpt from the auditor's report in file#8f4619b333d84b20, which I had shared earlier.\n\nThis has unfortunately become a blocker for the project. Our internal security team, led by Suresh, had previously raised this concern (ref: email#1b5f22de924c41f7), and the audit finding now makes remediation non-negotiable. Our engineering team has analyzed the token's 'exp' claim from our Kibana logs and confirmed the 24-hour validity. While our reporting service, which pushes data to your `/v2/reporting/submit` endpoint, is stable and handles the current 5K TPS load with p99 latency at ~450ms, this long-lived token poses a significant security risk that we must address immediately.\n\nWe have already created a ticket, JIRA PAY-1749, to track the necessary changes on our side. Priya's team is prepared to update our service's token management and caching layer to handle a more frequent OAuth 2.0 refresh cycle. However, we are completely dependent on your team to make the configuration change on the ICICI auth server first.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **ICICI Bank Team (Vikram):** Can you please confirm by EOD tomorrow if you can reduce the access token expiry duration to 1 hour (3600 seconds) for our specific client ID? This is our highest priority for this integration right now.\n2.  **Juspay Eng Team (Priya):** Please be on standby to deploy the changes outlined in JIRA PAY-1749 to our staging environment as soon as ICICI confirms the server-side update. We will need to run a full regression test to ensure the new token refresh logic doesn't impact transaction reporting, especially during peak loads.\n\nWe have a firm deadline of next Tuesday to present a concrete remediation plan to the auditors. I'm feeling the pressure on this one, as it puts our go-live timeline at risk.

Building on your analysis in email f2ceae5c3b42484b, I've spent the morning digging into the UPI reconciliation failures for the RBI Cross-Border reporting implementation with ICICI Bank.\n\nHere’s a summary of my findings for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603:\n\n**Investigation Summary:**\nI've traced a batch of transactions from yesterday (between 14:00 and 16:30 IST) that were successful on our end but are missing from the T+1 settlement file provided by ICICI (ref: file#8f4619b333d84b20). The total discrepancy accounts for approximately 0.8% of the cross-border volume processed via their gateway during that window.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show that the primary UPI transaction API is healthy, with p99 latency holding steady at ~210ms and an API-level error rate below 0.1%. Kibana logs confirm our system received a `200 OK` from ICICI’s `/v2/payments/upi/initiate` endpoint for all the missing transactions. This is a bit frustrating, as it suggests the failure is happening silently on their end, post-acknowledgment.\n\n**Root Cause Hypothesis:**\nMy leading theory is that there's an issue with how ICICI's backend systems are processing the new metadata fields required for the RBI mandate. I suspect that while their public-facing API accepts our payload (which includes `purpose_code` and `remitter_info` as per spec), their downstream settlement-generation service is either dropping these transactions or failing to parse them correctly. This would explain why we get a success response, but the funds never appear in the final settlement report. I've ruled out any issues with our OAuth 2.0 flow or JWT token generation; scopes and claims are all correct.\n\nThis is a critical issue. The inability to perform a clean T+1 reconciliation directly jeopardizes our ability to comply with the RBI's daily reporting requirements. We're tracking this with high priority under JIRA PAY-5594.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **ICICI Bank Team:** Can we formally request that their engineering team investigate the end-to-end lifecycle for the transaction IDs listed in JIRA PAY-5594?

The data you pulled confirms what we're seeing on the compliance monitoring side: the new fraud detection model deployed for the RBI cross-border mandate is generating an unsustainable number of false positives.\n\nI’ve spent the morning in Kibana reviewing logs from the `fraud-detection-service` pods, and our Grafana dashboards are lighting up. The false positive rate for international transactions has spiked from our baseline of ~0.4% to a very concerning 4.2% over the last 48 hours. This is creating a significant bottleneck for the ICICI Bank integration (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nThe primary culprit appears to be an over-aggressiveness in flagging transactions with the internal code `FRAUD_RISK_SCORE_HIGH` (7104). The manual review queue is consequently overflowing, and our ops team is validating that the vast majority of these are legitimate transactions. This isn't just a poor customer experience; the review backlog is putting our T+1 settlement reconciliation process with ICICI at risk. We're also seeing a minor degradation in our `/v2/tx/pre-auth` endpoint latency, which has crept up from an average of 250ms to ~330ms at p99, likely due to the increased model complexity during auth flows.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, while we absolutely must satisfy the RBI's stringent fraud monitoring requirements, this level of service disruption is its own form of compliance risk. We need to show we can remediate this quickly and have it documented for our audit trail, as outlined in the process guide `file#8f4619b333d84b20`. This situation seems directly tied to the new rule set we discussed in email 1b5f22de924c41f7.\n\nI have created JIRA PAY-2861 to formally track this and have linked your analysis. Could we please get the data science team to prioritize an investigation into the model's feature weights? I suspect the `first_time_cross_border_user` and `tx_origin_geo_mismatch` features may be weighted too heavily.\n\nAs an immediate containment strategy, can we explore running the new model in shadow mode for another 72 hours? This would allow us to gather more data for tuning without actively blocking legitimate customer transactions. The alternative would be a targeted rollback of the most aggressive rules.\n\nLet’s schedule a 30-minute call tomorrow morning with the fraud engineering and data science leads to align on a path forward.

Regarding the point you raised in your last email (40f0f642de844ac5) about their proposed `/v2/forex/settlement/report` endpoint, my team and I have completed a preliminary technical review and simulation based on the specs in file#8f4619b333d84b20.\n\nTo be frank, while moving away from the current T+2 SFTP batch process is a huge step forward for this RBI mandate, I have some significant concerns about the API in its current form. As you know, for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603, our primary goal is not just speed but auditable, error-free reporting. A failure here could have serious compliance repercussions.\n\nHere’s a summary of our findings from the staging environment tests:\n\n1.  **Performance:** We simulated a load mirroring our peak cross-border transaction volume (approx. 15K TPS) against a mock of the proposed endpoint. The average latency was around 480ms, which is acceptable. However, we saw p99 latency spikes hitting 2.2s, which is worrying. Our Grafana dashboard (Payments-ICICI-Staging-Latency) shows these spikes coincide with intermittent `503 Service Unavailable` responses from the endpoint. This suggests potential stability issues on the bank's side under sustained load.\n\n2.  **Critical Risk - Idempotency:** My main concern, and a potential blocker, is the lack of a mandatory idempotency key in the API request payload. As a risk lead, I can't sign off on an integration where network failures or timeouts could lead to duplicate settlement reports being submitted to the regulator. This is a fundamental requirement for any financial operation API, and its absence is a major gap. I've detailed this specific risk in our internal assessment, referencing the earlier discussions in email#1b5f22de924c41f7.\n\n3.  **Data Reconciliation:** The current API response schema lacks fields for the original transaction reference and the final settled forex rate. This makes automated reconciliation against our internal settlement system incredibly difficult and pushes us back towards manual checks, defeating the purpose of the API.\n\nThis entire effort is being tracked under JIRA PAY-2064, and I've just updated the ticket with these blocking issues. We are running against a tight deadline for the RBI mandate, and these issues need to be addressed urgently.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Rohan:** Can you please escalate this to your primary technical contact at ICICI immediately? We need a revised API specification that includes a mandatory `request_id` for idempotency and the additional reconciliation fields. We also need an explanation for the `503` errors observed.\n*   **Priya (on CC):** Please pause any further development on the client-side implementation for PAY-2064 until we get a firm, revised contract from ICICI Bank.\n*   **Anjali (Me):** I will prepare a formal risk assessment document based on these findings to share with our compliance team.\n\nLet’s try to schedule a joint call with the ICICI tech team for tomorrow or the day after to resolve this.

The spike in false positives from our cross-border fraud model is definitely concerning, and I've been digging into it this morning.\n\nOur primary Grafana dashboard confirms the issue: the false positive rate for international transactions processed via the ICICI gateway has jumped to 4.5% in the last 24 hours, against our acceptable threshold of 0.75%. This is translating into a significant number of legitimate customer payments being declined with the `ERR_SUSPECTED_FRAUD` code, and it's putting our T+1 settlement cycle at risk for these corridors.\n\nThe investigation documented in JIRA PAY-5414, building on the initial thread, strongly suggests the root cause lies in how our Sentinel fraud engine is interpreting the new RBI-mandated purpose codes. As you'll recall from our earlier discussion (ref: email 1b5f22de924c41f7), we anticipated some friction here. It seems the model's feature weighting for the `transaction_narrative` field, when combined with certain new purpose codes specified in ICICI's spec doc (file#8f4619b333d84b20), is what's causing these incorrect classifications.\n\nLooking at the Kibana logs, transactions with purpose codes P1302 and P1306, especially for amounts between $500-$1000, are being flagged disproportionately. This is a serious problem for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603, as it directly impacts the compliance reporting accuracy we need to deliver.\n\nTo move forward, I have a couple of action items:\n\n1.  **Priya/Sandeep:** Can we please prioritize retraining the model on the staging environment? We need to use the historical transaction data from the last 90 days, synthetically enriched with the new purpose codes, to recalibrate the weights.

Building on the initial observations in email 6810f697565243e6, I've completed a root cause analysis for the API timeouts impacting the RBI Cross-Border Reporting implementation with ICICI Bank.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe core issue is an intermittent failure in the OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow with ICICI's `/token` endpoint. This is causing a cascading failure in our downstream reporting service, which is responsible for submitting transaction data as per the mandate.\n\n**Technical Details & Impact:**\n\n*   **System:** Our `reporting-service` running in the `pre-prod` Kubernetes cluster.\n*   **Symptom:** Between 14:30 and 16:00 IST today, we observed a 4.5% error rate on calls to ICICI's `/v1/crossborder/reportTransaction` API. Our Grafana dashboard shows P99 latency for these failed requests exceeding our 2.5s circuit-breaker threshold.\n*   **Root Cause:** Kibana logs (linked in JIRA PAY-1374) confirm our service receives an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` response. Digging deeper, the preceding call to the `/token` endpoint for a new JWT is either timing out or, in some cases, returning an invalid token structure that our parser correctly rejects. This happens despite our service attempting the refresh a full 5 minutes before the 60-minute token expiry, as specified in file#8f4619b333d84b20.\n*   **Analysis:** We've ruled out clock skew and credential issues on our side. The failures seem to correlate with periods where our simulated transaction load for this API surpasses 50 TPS. This deviates from the initial theory of a network blip (ref: email#1b5f22de924c41f7) and strongly suggests a rate-limiting or capacity constraint on the bank's authentication server.\n\nThis has become a critical blocker for our UAT phase for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603. We cannot proceed to production with this level of instability, as it directly compromises our ability to meet the RBI's stringent reporting requirements.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **ICICI Team (cc'd Rahul):** Can your team please investigate the server-side logs for our `client_id` (`JUSPAY_PROD_CB_REPORTING`) on your OAuth authorization server for the 14:30-16:00 IST window? We need to understand the cause of the timeouts and malformed token responses under moderate load.\n2.  **Aditya:** Can we please formally escalate this with our technical account manager at ICICI? The current support channel isn't providing the turnaround we need for a compliance-critical project.\n\nAs a temporary mitigation, I am deploying a more aggressive retry policy with exponential backoff on the token refresh call. This will be pushed to staging by EOD, but it's a band-aid, not a long-term solution. We need a stable authentication flow from the bank's end.\n\nLet's connect tomorrow morning to discuss their feedback.\n\nBest,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757916960000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","aditya.singh@juspay.in","rahul.verma@icicibank.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"]}},

Building on the initial alert from your email a851b7621c75429e, I've conducted a deeper investigation into the PCI compliance audit finding, and the situation is quite serious.\n\nThe core issue stems from the ICICI Bank UAT environment for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting Mandate (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603). After reviewing the Kibana logs from our staging cluster's interactions with their `/v2/reporting/submitTransaction` endpoint, I can confirm the auditor's finding. For failed transactions that return an ICICI-specific error code (e.g., `GW_503_TIMEOUT`), the API response body is including the full, unmasked Primary Account Number (PAN).\n\nThis is a critical violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4, which mandates that PAN must be rendered unreadable wherever it is stored, including in logs. The preliminary audit report (ref: file#8f4619b333d84b20) has classified this as a Level 1 finding, which puts our certification at immediate risk.\n\nI have created and detailed this in JIRA PAY-9285 with log extracts and references to the specific RBI circulars. We cannot move forward with the production deployment until this is fully remediated by ICICI Bank. The auditors require a formal Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and a remediation plan from us by the end of this week, which is a very tight turnaround.\n\nSeparately, but relatedly, the performance of this UAT endpoint is still not meeting our production-readiness criteria. Our Grafana monitoring shows P99 latency is peaking at 1.8s during batch processing tests, far exceeding the 750ms SLA outlined in our agreement. This is contributing to a 3.2% error rate in our settlement reconciliation service, which is unsustainable.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **[ICICI Bank Team]**: We need an urgent confirmation of this PAN logging vulnerability on your side and a firm timeline for a patch deployment to your UAT environment. This is our highest priority.\n2.  **[Aditya/Dev Team]**: Can you please investigate the feasibility of implementing a temporary sanitization layer in our API gateway as a mitigating control? This would involve intercepting responses from ICICI and masking the PAN before it reaches our internal logging systems. We need this as a backup plan for the auditors.\n3.  **[Priya - Myself]**: I will begin drafting the formal response to the auditors but will need the remediation timeline from ICICI to complete it.\n\nI'm escalating this to management and will be scheduling an emergency call with our counterparts at ICICI Bank for tomorrow morning.

Building on your initial analysis in email 57af6ab4bc844546, I've dug into the logs and this performance bottleneck is more severe than we initially thought, especially given our proximity to the RBI mandate deadline.\n\nMy investigation confirms the latency originates from ICICI's new core banking system (CBS) endpoint. Our internal services, including the UPI gateway and settlement reconciliation system, are operating well within their 90ms p99 SLO. However, our load tests in the staging environment show the round-trip time for ICICI's `/v2/cbs/inquireTransaction` endpoint is averaging 1.9s and spiking to over 2.5s under a simulated load of only 800 TPS. This is a significant deviation from the sub-400ms latency we agreed upon, as documented in our earlier technical discussion (ref: email 1b5f22de924c41f7).\n\nLooking at the Kibana logs for our Kubernetes pods, the entire delay occurs after we post the request to their gateway. The JWT generation and our OAuth 2.0 flow are clean, completing in ~120ms. The problem begins once their system attempts to query the newly migrated transaction database. Our Grafana dashboard clearly shows the timeout error rate climbing from 0.1% to 3.5% as we ramp up the transaction volume, which is unacceptable for production. We've captured this under JIRA PAY-4168.\n\nThis bottleneck directly threatens our ability to meet the RBI's real-time reporting requirements. At this rate, our T+1 settlement reconciliation batch jobs will fail or run into severe delays, causing compliance breaches. The downstream impact on fraud detection models that rely on timely transaction status is also a major concern.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Aditya:** Please compile a comprehensive report including the Grafana dashboard exports and the specific Kibana log queries showing the end-to-end transaction lifecycle. I've started a draft in file#8f4619b333d84b20; please add your findings there.\n2.  **Anjali (self):** I am forwarding this thread to Rohan Mehra and the technical team at ICICI, demanding an urgent RCA. I will stress that this is a critical blocker for the work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603.\n\nI'm scheduling a mandatory war room call with ICICI for tomorrow at 11:00 AM IST to get to the bottom of this.

Building on your last email (ref: 5d0437596dce48ac), I need to escalate a critical issue we're observing with the fraud detection model's performance within the RBI Cross-Border Reporting Mandate implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nWhile your team suggested transient network issues, our internal monitoring indicates a systemic problem. Over the last 48 hours, our Grafana dashboards show that the false positive rate from your fraud detection API has jumped from a stable baseline of 0.75% to a sustained average of 4.6%. This is directly impacting our overall transaction success rate for international payments, which is now trending downwards and is becoming a significant concern for our merchants.\n\nOur logs in Kibana correlate this spike directly with an increase in `FRAUD_SCORE_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED` (Error Code: 7533) responses from the pre-authorization check endpoint. The API latency itself remains within the 250ms SLA, but the high rejection rate is the primary issue. I've attached a log extract as file#8f4619b333d84b20 which shows a pattern of legitimate, low-risk transactions being incorrectly flagged. My engineering counterpart, Priya, has also cross-verified that there have been no changes to our payload structure or the JWT token generation in our OAuth 2.0 flow.\n\nGiven the urgency of maintaining service levels and ensuring accurate reporting for the upcoming RBI mandate, this is a top priority for us. This issue is being tracked internally under JIRA ticket PAY-4747.

This is for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting implementation with ICICI, tracked under Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603.\n\nHere’s a summary of my findings:\n\n**1. Performance Impact:**\nBetween 16:30 and 17:15 IST, our Grafana monitoring dashboard (`payments-risk-engine-prod`) showed a significant degradation. The p99 latency for our internal `/v2/risk/score` endpoint jumped from a baseline of ~180ms to sustained peaks of over 2.1 seconds. During this period, our transaction volume remained stable at approximately 12k TPS, but the API's error rate increased from its usual 0.2% to 3.5%, primarily due to downstream timeouts.\n\n**2. Root Cause Analysis:**\nI've analyzed the Kibana logs for the affected Kubernetes pods, and the issue points externally. The logs show a clear pattern of increased response times from the ICICI Bank API endpoint we call for transaction enrichment (`/fsp-enrichment-v3`). Our internal service metrics (CPU/memory utilization, GC pauses) remained healthy, and I can confirm our OAuth 2.0 client's JWT token refresh flow was operating correctly with no 4xx errors, ruling out an authentication issue on our side.\n\nThe bottleneck appears to be on ICICI's end. It seems their service was unable to cope with the transaction load, leading to a queuing delay that cascaded back to our system. This is a bit worrying, as it directly impacts our ability to meet the real-time processing SLAs required by the RBI mandate.\n\n**3. Actions Taken & Next Steps:**\n\n*   I have created JIRA PAY-7882 to formally track this incident and have attached the relevant log excerpts and Grafana dashboard snapshots.\n*   As a temporary mitigation, I have pushed a minor configuration change to slightly increase the connection timeout threshold for the ICICI HTTP client. This is a stopgap to reduce immediate failures but does not solve the underlying latency problem.\n*   **Action Item:** Could you please take the lead on escalating this with our technical contacts at ICICI Bank? We need them to investigate the performance of their `fsp-enrichment-v3` API during the specified time window and provide us with an RCA. It's critical we get an assurance that their infrastructure can meet the performance requirements detailed in our agreement (ref: file#8f4619b333d84b20).\n\nI will continue to keep a close eye on the metrics. If this reoccurs, we may need to prioritize implementing a circuit breaker in our service to protect our system from these external delays.

The data confirms my primary concern: the API rate limiting from ICICI Bank is now a critical blocker for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting Mandate project (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is becoming quite stressful. The deadline is firm, and these technical hurdles are putting our ability to meet the T+1 reporting requirement at significant risk.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show that ICICI is enforcing a hard cap of approximately 50 TPS on their `/v2/reporting/submitTransaction` endpoint. During our load tests yesterday, this caused our P99 latency to spike from a baseline of ~250ms to over 2.1s, which is unsustainable. Kibana logs are filled with `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` responses, contributing to a transaction submission error rate of nearly 5.0% during peak intervals. This is all being tracked in JIRA PAY-8734.\n\nWhile the engineering team has implemented an exponential backoff strategy, this is merely a stopgap. It creates a growing backlog in our internal queue, and we cannot risk submission delays that would violate the mandate. The service levels defined in our agreement (ref: file#8f4619b333d84b20) clearly specified a much higher throughput capacity.\n\nWe need to escalate this formally and urgently. Here are my proposed next steps:\n\n1.  **Aditya (Eng Lead):** Can you please compile a detailed incident report from the logs?

I will explicitly demand a clear timeline for increasing our production rate limit to the agreed-upon 500 TPS.\n\nI’m concerned that this isn’t just a simple configuration change on their end. We also need to get clarity on their OAuth 2.0 token refresh policies; we must ensure our JWT management isn't inadvertently contributing to the issue.\n\nLet's sync up later today to review the escalation draft before I send it.

The error rate for transactions we flag internally with a `risk_score > 0.75` has climbed to 4.8% in the last 72 hours, up from a baseline of ~0.3%. This is a critical bottleneck for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603 and puts our compliance with the RBI mandate at risk.\n\nLooking at the Kibana logs, our calls to ICICI's `/v2/customer/enhanced-kyc-check` endpoint are consistently returning an HTTP `422 Unprocessable Entity` for these profiles. The response body contains `{'error_code': 'EKYC_INSUFFICIENT_DATA', 'message': 'Enhanced due diligence parameters missing'}`. The p99 latency on these failed requests is also spiking to around 1.8s, well above our 450ms average for successful calls, which suggests their system is attempting validation before rejecting the request.\n\nMy hypothesis is that our current integration doesn't account for an extended data payload required for customers that both our systems and theirs flag as high-risk. I cross-referenced this with ICICI's API specification (file#8f4619b333d84b20), and it does list optional fields like `source_of_funds` and `nature_of_business` which we are not currently passing.

This directly impacts our RBI reporting accuracy, so we need to find a permanent solution before the next reporting cycle.\n\nMy analysis of the Kibana logs for our `payment-gateway-prod` environment shows a spike in `ERR_ROUTING_NO_VALID_PATH` for EUR/GBP transactions that should be routed via ICICI. The issue seems to be when ICICI's API temporarily rate-limits us (HTTP 429). Our intended fallback logic, which should trigger a retry through an alternate partner gateway, isn't firing. I suspect the transaction state is not being correctly passed from the gateway service to the Euler ledger service to initiate the retry flow. We need to confirm this behavior and decide on the fix.\n\nProposed Agenda & Outcomes:\n1.  **Review Data:** Walk through the Grafana dashboard (`cross-border-latency-errors-v2`) and a BigQuery analysis that shows the correlation between ICICI's 429s and our routing failures.\n2.  **Hypothesis Validation:** Riya, can you walk us through the code path for state transfer between the payment gateway and Euler? Let's pinpoint where the `retry_eligible` flag might be getting lost.\n3.  **Action Plan:** Define clear action items. I think we need a code fix, not another config change.

The root cause is our Flink-based stream processor's handling of the NPCI `BT` (Transaction Timed-out at Switch) response code. The processor, consuming from the `upi_icici_response_stream` Kafka topic, incorrectly promotes transactions with a `BT` status to `TXN_SUCCESS` in our primary `transactions_v2` PostgreSQL table if a final status callback from the NPCI switch is not received within the configured 30-second window. This optimistic marking directly conflicts with ICICI's end-of-day settlement files (`ICICI_UPI_SETTLEMENT_YYYYMMDD.csv`), where these transactions are correctly flagged as `REVERSED` or are absent, leading to reconciliation failures.","The financial impact averages around 2,500 transactions daily, with discrepancies peaking during high-volume periods as observed on our Grafana dashboard (ID: d/def456/payments-errors). Our internal reconciliation service, 'ReconBot', flags these mismatches, but the current alerting threshold is too high, preventing proactive intervention. The core logic flaw lies in assuming a `BT` response will eventually resolve to a success, which is not guaranteed, especially in cases of network partitions between the acquirer and the NPCI core.","The immediate remediation involves deploying a patch to the Flink job. This patch will modify the state management to hold `BT` status transactions in a `PENDING_RECON` state for an extended 120-second timeout. If no definitive callback arrives, the status will default to `TXN_FAILED`. Concurrently, a backfill script is being developed to query the `transactions_v2` table for all `TXN_SUCCESS` records with an initial `BT` response code from the past 14 days, cross-referencing them against the raw settlement files stored in the `s3://juspay-settlements-prod-archive/icici/` bucket to correct their final status.

The root cause traces back to an intermittent failure in our OAuth2 token refresh mechanism. The access token, stored in a Redis cache (key: `icici:oauth:token:cbr`) with a 3600-second TTL, was not being refreshed successfully. Our investigation shows that calls to ICICI's `/oauth/token` endpoint with the 'refresh_token' grant type were sporadically returning an HTTP 503 'Service Unavailable' error instead of a standard OAuth error like 'invalid_grant'. Our service's retry logic did not correctly interpret this 503, causing it to retain the expired access token in the cache.","The consequence of this caching issue was a cascade of HTTP 401 'Unauthorized' errors from the primary reporting API, as our service attempted to authenticate with the stale token. This triggered the Hystrix circuit breaker for the ICICI integration, leading to widespread HTTP 504 'Gateway Timeout' errors for all subsequent reporting requests. Grafana dashboard 'payments-latency' (def456) shows P99 latency for our internal reporting submission API jumping from a baseline of 180ms to over 45,000ms.

Building on the analysis from file 3e0b0a0964164bad, I've investigated further, and it confirms our suspicions about the ICICI API.\n\nThis is becoming a critical bottleneck for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting Mandate implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603). Our Grafana dashboards are showing a sustained, high volume of `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors from their `/v2/transactions/report` endpoint. We appear to be hard-capped at around 80 TPS. This is significantly below the 250 TPS we modeled for peak load, and it's causing our reporting submission queue to grow at an alarming rate.\n\nLooking at the Kibana logs from our reporting service pods, our outbound requests are correctly formed, and the OAuth 2.0 flow for JWT token generation is healthy. The issue is isolated to this specific endpoint. The p99 latency for successful calls has degraded from our baseline of ~400ms to over 2.5s due to the retry storm this is creating.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, this is a major red flag. The RBI mandate stipulates T+1 reporting. At the current throughput, we are trending towards a T+2 cycle, which is a direct violation and exposes us to potential regulatory penalties. I've logged this as a high-priority risk in JIRA PAY-8674.\n\nI have already sent a formal query to our technical counterpart at ICICI Bank, providing them with a sample of correlation IDs from the last hour showing the 429 errors. To strengthen our case for an immediate escalation, could you please get your team to quantify the maximum processing backlog our settlement system can handle before it impacts our core transaction processing SLAs?\n\nFrankly, I'm a bit concerned we didn't catch this during UAT. If we don't receive a new, higher rate limit or a concrete resolution plan from them in the next 24 hours, I strongly suggest we escalate this to our relationship manager.

This is a temporary but crucial fix to stop the data leakage.\n\n2.  **Long-Term Solution (Target: End of Sprint):** We need to re-architect this flow to use our internal Vault service. The reporting service should only ever receive a token reference, not the raw PAN. It would then de-tokenize the data in-memory just before building the request to ICICI's API, ensuring no sensitive data ever touches the disk or logs. This is the correct, compliant architecture we should have had.\n\nFrom the ICICI Bank team, I have a couple of urgent requests:\n\n*   Can you please confirm that your UAT environment is available for us to test our hotfix? We'll need to send a few hundred test transactions to validate that our masking logic doesn't inadvertently corrupt the payload sent to you.\n*   Looking at our Grafana dashboard, the P99 latency for this API call is hovering around 650ms, with a success rate of 99.8%. We need to ensure our changes don't degrade this performance. Could you confirm if there are any rate limits on your UAT endpoint we should be aware of during this load test?\n*   Finally, as per the spec sheet (file#3e0b0a0964164bad), we expect a `TXN_RPT_001` success code. Can you provide a list of specific error codes we might receive if we send a malformed or improperly authenticated request post-patch? This is essential for our alerting thresholds.\n\nOur internal goal is to have the hotfix deployed to production within the next 36 hours, pending successful UAT validation. Let's schedule a brief sync for Friday morning to confirm deployment and discuss the timeline for the permanent tokenization fix.\n\nThank you,\n\nAnjali Patel"],"timestamp":1757912100000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","rahul.verma@icicibank.com","compliance-team@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Regarding the issue you highlighted in email 752ca951f3fd4f47, our engineering team has completed their initial investigation, and I wanted to share our findings on the API timeouts.\n\nOur analysis confirms that the issue is directly linked to the OAuth 2.0 token refresh mechanism for the RBI cross-border reporting API endpoint. Aditya Singh, our lead engineer on this integration, has pinpointed the source of the cascading failures. \n\nHere are the specifics from our side:\n\n*   **Monitoring & Metrics:** Our Grafana dashboards showed a sharp degradation starting around 14:30 IST yesterday. The error rate for calls to your `/v1/reporting/submit_transaction` endpoint spiked from a baseline of <0.1% to over 4.5%. P99 latency increased from an average of 450ms to over 2.5s, ultimately leading to connection timeouts.\n*   **Error Logs:** Diving into the Kibana logs, our services are consistently receiving `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` responses specifically when attempting to use a refreshed JWT. The initial `client_credentials` grant for a new token works flawlessly, but subsequent attempts to use the `refresh_token` grant type are failing intermittently. This is now tracked under JIRA PAY-9728.\n*   **Technical Root Cause:** Our systems are initiating the refresh flow well within the token's validity period, adhering strictly to the specifications in doc `file#3e0b0a0964164bad`. This strongly suggests the issue is not on our client-side implementation but rather with the validation of the refresh token on ICICI's auth server. Our Kubernetes pods handling the requests show no signs of resource exhaustion, further isolating the problem to the API interaction itself.\n\nTo be frank, this level of instability is a significant concern, especially for work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603. The outage yesterday impacted the automated reporting of over 12,000 transactions, forcing a manual reconciliation process that is not scalable and introduces compliance risk. As we discussed in our planning call (ref: email `77d1878146f0437d`), a stable auth flow is fundamental for meeting the RBI mandate.\n\nCould your team please prioritize an investigation into the OAuth server logs for our client ID? We suspect there may be an issue with a rate-limiter or token introspection logic that is incorrectly invalidating legitimate refresh tokens.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **ICICI Bank Team:** Please investigate the auth server logs for `401` errors related to refresh token grants for our client ID and provide an RCA.\n2.  **Aditya Singh (Juspay):** Please begin developing a temporary fallback strategy to perform a full re-authentication if a refresh fails, and document the potential performance impact.\n3.  **All:** I am scheduling an urgent joint-debugging call for tomorrow at 11:00 AM IST to resolve this. Please expect an invite shortly.\n\nAppreciate your team's immediate focus on this. Let's work together to get this stabilized as soon as possible.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRohit Sharma"],"timestamp":1757912280000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["sameer.verma@icicibank.com","pranav.mehta@icicibank.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"]}},

Building on your analysis in email e438d07794b24dea, I've done a deep dive into the KYC automation failures for high-risk customer segments in our staging environment.\n\nHere’s a summary of my findings for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603:\n\n**1. Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe issue is isolated to calls made to ICICI’s `/v2/customer/enhanced-due-diligence` endpoint for customers explicitly marked with a risk profile of 'HIGH'. Our standard KYC API calls for low/medium-risk profiles are succeeding with a P99 latency of ~320ms, which is well within our SLA.\n\nDrilling down into the Kibana logs for our `icici-payment-adaptor` service, I'm consistently seeing a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response from ICICI’s end. The response body contains the error code `EDD_PAYLOAD_INCOMPLETE`. This happens almost instantly (<150ms), which points to a payload validation failure rather than a processing timeout on their side. Our Grafana dashboard for the staging environment shows the error rate for this specific transaction type has spiked to 21% over the last 12 hours.\n\nMy hypothesis is that our payload generation logic, managed within the JWT claim set for the OAuth 2.0 flow, is missing mandatory fields required only for the 'HIGH' risk category. Reviewing the API spec (file#3e0b0a0964164bad), the documentation around the `additionalDeclarations` object is a bit ambiguous. It seems our current implementation is not correctly populating the nested `sourceOfWealth` and `pepDetails` (Politically Exposed Person) fields, which ICICI's system likely requires for enhanced due diligence as per the RBI mandate.\n\n**2. Infrastructure Health:**\nI've confirmed there are no underlying infrastructure issues. Our Kubernetes cluster health is nominal, and the pods for the `icici-payment-adaptor` service show no signs of CPU or memory throttling. Outbound network connectivity to ICICI’s UAT environment is stable.\n\n**3. Impact:**\nThis is a critical blocker. The failure to automate KYC for this segment means we cannot generate the necessary audit logs, which is a key requirement for our upcoming SOC 2 Type II audit. This also puts our Q4 deadline for full compliance with the RBI cross-border reporting mandate at risk. The JIRA ticket PAY-3501 has been updated with these findings.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Ankit (ICICI Bank):** Could your team please provide an explicit JSON schema or a sample payload for a 'HIGH' risk customer profile for the `/v2/customer/enhanced-due-diligence` endpoint? Specifically, we need confirmation on the data types and mandatory status of all fields within the `additionalDeclarations` object. This would be a huge help.\n\n*   **Arjun (Me):** I will prepare a patch to our `icici-kyc-connector` service to include the suspected missing fields based on my interpretation of the spec. I will hold off on deploying to staging until we get confirmation from Ankit's team to avoid further failed requests.\n\n*   **Priya:** Can you please assess the timeline impact for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603 and flag this as a red status in our weekly sync?\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nOnce we receive the payload confirmation from ICICI, I expect to have a fix deployed to the staging environment within 4 hours. We can then re-run the failed batch of ~5,000 transactions to validate the solution. If the issue persists, I suggest we schedule a joint debugging session with ICICI's technical team before the end of this week.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\n\nArjun Mehta"],"timestamp":1757912460000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","anand.krishnan@juspay.in","ankit.s.sharma@icicibank.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"]}},

Building on your analysis in email c53c2530ce64479c regarding the multi-currency settlement process, I've completed a compliance review in the context of our ICICI Bank integration for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603.\n\nThe core of the problem is that our current T+2 batch settlement file from ICICI, detailed in file#3e0b0a0964164bad, is fundamentally incompatible with the RBI's real-time reporting requirement. The mandate specifies that transaction purpose codes and forex conversion data must be captured at the point of transaction, not reconciled 48 hours later. Relying on the old flow introduces a major compliance gap.\n\nThe proposed solution is to integrate ICICI's new real-time forex quoting API, `POST /v3/fx/quote`. However, this introduces significant performance concerns. Our payment gateway's P99 latency is currently stable at ~180ms. A synchronous, blocking call to an external banking partner's API could easily add 300-500ms, pushing our total transaction time towards the 700ms mark. This is a substantial degradation that could increase cart abandonment and trigger upstream timeouts.\n\nFrom a monitoring perspective, our Grafana dashboards aren't configured to track the performance of this specific external dependency. We would need to build out new monitoring for the `/v3/fx/quote` endpoint latency and error rates. I'm concerned about potential new error codes, like an `E481-INVALID_PURPOSE_CODE` from ICICI, that could cause our current transaction success rate of 99.8% to dip below our 99.5% SLA.\n\nThis also creates a reconciliation nightmare. The existing process is already strained. Adding a real-time quoted rate that might differ from the final settlement rate requires a more sophisticated reconciliation engine that can handle stateful, multi-stage transaction validation. JIRA PAY-7648, which tracks the reporting implementation, will need to be expanded to include this reconciliation sub-task.\n\nHere are the action items I've identified:\n\n1.  **Engineering (cc: Suresh):** Could you please initiate a technical spike to evaluate the integration of the `/v3/fx/quote` API? We need a rough estimate of the effort and a recommendation on a synchronous vs. asynchronous implementation that still meets the compliance requirement of showing a user a confirmed rate.\n2.  **Product (Aditya):** We must secure a firm SLA from ICICI for this API. I would recommend pushing for a P99 latency of <200ms and a guaranteed uptime of 99.9%. We cannot compromise our platform's stability.\n3.  **Compliance (Myself):** I will draft a formal risk assessment memo detailing these issues and link it to PAY-7648 by tomorrow, EOD. I'll also update the Confluence page with these findings.\n\nWe are on a tight schedule with the RBI deadline looming. We need to finalize our architectural approach by the end of this week. Let's connect tomorrow to discuss this further.\n\nBest,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":1757912640000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh@juspay.in","suresh.kumar@juspay.in","payments-engineering@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This is a critical issue, and I've spent the last hour investigating with the SRE team.\n\n**Summary of the Issue:**\nOur `cross-border-reporting-service` is logging unmasked Cardholder Data (specifically PANs) for transactions processed via ICICI Bank's new remittance flow. This is a direct violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 (rendering PAN unreadable anywhere it is stored). This issue is directly tied to the implementation for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603.\n\n**Technical Root Cause Analysis:**\nAfter reviewing the Kibana logs for our Kubernetes pods in the `ap-south-1` cluster, we've confirmed that the raw request/response payloads between our service and ICICI's `/v2/remittance/confirm` endpoint are being written to stdout. The issue seems to stem from a new debug-level logging interceptor added last week that executes before our standard PII data-masking filter within the application logic. This means our tokenization and masking logic is being bypassed at the logging stage, even though the data is handled correctly in-memory and for settlement.\n\nWe've correlated this with a performance degradation alert from our Grafana dashboard (see RBI-CrossBorder-Latency), where p99 latency for this service spiked to ~850ms from a baseline of 250ms, likely due to the verbose logging I/O.\n\n**Immediate Mitigation & Impact:**\n1.  **Service Shutdown:** As of 14:30 IST, we have scaled the `cross-border-reporting-service` deployment to zero replicas to prevent any further data leakage. This will temporarily halt the automated reporting for ICICI Bank, but it's a necessary step.\n2.  **Data Exposure:** We have identified approximately 12,500 transaction logs from the past 72 hours containing unmasked PANs. These logs must be purged immediately.\n3.  **Tracking:** I have created JIRA ticket **PAY-9723** to formally track this incident, the remediation, and all associated tasks.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n*   **[OWNER: Infra Team, CC: Aditya] Log Purge (High Priority):** We need to initiate an emergency procedure to purge the affected logs from our Elasticsearch cluster and any downstream archival storage. Aditya, can you please coordinate with the security team to get the necessary approvals and oversee this process? This needs to be completed by EOD today, Oct 24.\n*   **[OWNER: Payments-Dev Team, CC: Sandeep] Code Hotfix (Critical Priority):** The logging interceptor in `cross-border-reporting-service` must be reordered or modified to ensure it operates *after* the data masking filter. Please ensure the fix adheres to the specifications in Doc#bd83d0db45f942d4. We need a PR raised for review within the next 3 hours.\n*   **[OWNER: Anjali Patel] Stakeholder Communication:** I will handle communication with the PCI auditor and our contacts at ICICI Bank regarding the temporary reporting pause and our remediation plan.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nI am scheduling a 30-minute war room call for 16:00 IST today to finalize the hotfix approach and deployment plan. We are targeting a patched deployment to the staging environment by 19:00 IST for validation, with a production rollout no later than 11:00 IST tomorrow, Oct 25, post-security-review.\n\nThis is a serious lapse, and we need to ensure our post-mortem includes a review of our CI/CD pipeline to prevent a similar regression in the future.

This is quite concerning, especially given the tight deadlines for the RBI mandate implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nThe auditor flagging plaintext logging of transaction purpose codes and identifiers in our Kibana cluster is a critical issue. As you highlighted, this directly violates PCI DSS requirement 3.4. While this data is essential for the `report_crossborder` endpoint with ICICI Bank, logging it unmasked, even temporarily, puts our upcoming attestation at significant risk. The team has correctly raised this under JIRA PAY-9651.\n\nLooking at the Grafana dashboards, our p99 latency for calls to ICICI's endpoint is currently stable at ~480ms, which is within our 600ms SLA. However, we're processing over 15,000 international transactions per hour at peak, so any solution we implement must not introduce significant latency.\n\nI agree with the two-pronged approach you suggested. Here’s how I see us moving forward:\n\n**1. Immediate Mitigation (Internal):**\nYour team's proposal to immediately update the Logstash filter configuration on our Kubernetes cluster to mask the `purposeCode` and `transactionId` fields before they are indexed in Elasticsearch is the right first step. This contains the immediate compliance gap. Could you please prioritize this and provide an ETA for deployment to production? This should be treated as a hotfix.\n\n**2. Long-Term Solution (With ICICI Bank):**\nThe current implementation, as per the API specification in file#3e0b0a0964164bad, doesn't seem to account for end-to-end payload encryption for specific sensitive, non-cardholder data fields. I've been reviewing our previous technical discussions (ref: email#77d1878146f0437d) and this nuance was not explicitly covered.\n\nWe need to formally propose an API modification to ICICI Bank. I suggest we ask them to support a JWE (JSON Web Encryption) object for a new field, say `encryptedReportData`, while deprecating the plaintext fields. This would allow us to pass the required reporting data in a fully compliant manner. This will require a change in their decryption logic and our OAuth 2.0 JWT token generation flow but is the only robust way forward.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Aditya:** Please confirm the timeline for the internal logging hotfix and get JIRA PAY-9651 updated with the details. We need this done within the next 48 hours.\n*   **Rohit (Me):** I will draft a formal communication to Praveen Mehta at ICICI Bank outlining the issue, our proposed API enhancement, and the compliance imperative driving this. I will request an urgent meeting with their technical team to discuss feasibility and timelines.\n\nWe need to move quickly on this to ensure the project stays on track without compromising our security posture.

I've spent the morning investigating the performance degradation for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603), and my findings confirm our suspicions. We are being aggressively rate-limited by the ICICI bank API.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the situation:\n\n**1. The Core Issue:**\nThe ICICI `/v2/payments/crossborder/report` endpoint is responding with `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors once our call volume exceeds approximately 100-110 Transactions Per Second (TPS). This is significantly below our projected peak load of 800 TPS required to meet T+1 reporting SLAs during high-volume periods, a detail we had previously aligned on (ref: email 77d1878146f0437d).\n\n**2. Performance Impact Metrics:**\n*   **Error Rate:** Our Grafana dashboard (ICICI-Reporting-Prod) shows the error rate for this specific endpoint spiking from a baseline of <0.2% to over 4.8% during the last peak. I've attached a snapshot from Kibana showing the flood of `429`s, as seen in file#3e0b0a0964164bad.\n*   **Throughput:** We are effectively capped at ~100 TPS, causing a significant backlog in our reporting queue and jeopardizing our ability to comply with the mandate.\n*   **Latency & System Load:** While latency for successful requests (P99) is acceptable at around 400ms, the constant retries on failed requests are skewing our transaction processing dashboards and putting unnecessary strain on our reporting service Kubernetes pods.\n\n**3. Investigation & Mitigations:**\nI've ruled out issues on our side. The OAuth 2.0 flow is stable, and our JWT token management is reusing tokens correctly. I’ve implemented an exponential backoff strategy in our client, which has helped reduce the immediate pressure but doesn't solve the core throughput limitation. The current situation is quite concerning as it puts us at a clear risk of non-compliance with the RBI deadline.\n\n**4.

We need a formal confirmation of their documented rate limits and a firm timeline for increasing the TPS cap to at least 1,000 TPS to provide a safe operational buffer.\n*   **[ACTION - Arjun]** I have updated JIRA PAY-5956 with all technical logs and dashboard links for tracking. In parallel, I will start scoping a temporary solution to buffer these reporting requests using our Kafka cluster, but this adds architectural complexity we were hoping to avoid.\n\nWe cannot proceed to the next phase with this severe limitation in place.

Our Grafana dashboards show that P99 latency for the ICICI `/v2/report/crossborder` endpoint is spiking to over 2.5s, a significant deviation from our sub-500ms SLA. This seems to be directly correlated with ICICI's recent core banking system (CBS) migration.\n\nHere are the key findings:\n\n*   **Error Rate Spike:** Our Kibana logs show a surge in `503 Service Unavailable` and intermittent `408 Request Timeout` responses from ICICI's gateway. The transaction error rate has jumped from a baseline of ~0.2% to 3.5% during peak hours this morning. \n*   **Bottleneck Confirmed:** The latency is not originating from our infrastructure. Our Kubernetes pods for the reporting service are scaling as expected, and internal processing times remain under 80ms. The bottleneck is clearly on the connection to ICICI's backend post-authentication. The OAuth 2.0 JWT token exchange is functioning correctly, but the subsequent API calls are failing or timing out.\n*   **Compliance Risk:** This level of instability is putting our T+1 reporting capability at serious risk. Each failed call represents a transaction that we may not be able to report within the mandated timeframe, which could lead to audit failures and regulatory penalties. The reconciliation jobs are already queuing up.\n\nI've documented these findings, including log snippets and dashboard snapshots, in JIRA ticket PAY-9033. As you know from the initial discussions outlined in email 77d1878146f0437d, the RBI mandate requires near-100% reporting accuracy, and the current performance from ICICI's end makes that impossible.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.

Building on your analysis in email 5a5e71b6a77348f5, my team has completed an initial investigation into the API timeouts impacting the RBI Cross-Border Reporting implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nThe root cause appears to be an intermittent failure in ICICI Bank's OAuth 2.0 token refresh mechanism. Our systems are correctly attempting to refresh the JWT access token via their `/oauth/token` endpoint prior to its 60-minute expiry, but the endpoint is periodically unresponsive.\n\nOur Grafana dashboard for payment-errors shows a clear correlation: p99 latency for our `icici-report-submission` API calls spiked from a baseline of ~450ms to over 2.5s, coinciding with a surge in `504 Gateway Timeout` responses from our side. Digging into the Kibana logs (query attached to JIRA PAY-8999), we can see these timeouts are a direct result of our service waiting for a new token from ICICI, which eventually responds with an `HTTP 503 Service Unavailable` or simply times out. Yesterday's incident between 14:30 and 14:45 IST caused our error rate to climb to 4.2%, impacting approximately 40,395 reporting events. This isn't sustainable and puts our T+1 reporting SLA at risk.\n\nAs a temporary mitigation, the SRE team has deployed a more aggressive retry policy with exponential backoff on our client. This has helped, but it's a band-aid that increases overall processing latency.\n\nI have already opened a sev-1 ticket with the ICICI technical team, providing them with the detailed logs and API request/response payloads from file#3e0b0a0964164bad.

I'm writing to you with some urgency regarding a critical issue that has been flagged during our quarterly PCI DSS audit related to the RBI Cross-Border Reporting project (Work ID: c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nOur security team, while reviewing our Kibana logs, has identified instances where unmasked Primary Account Numbers (PAN) are being captured in our logging infrastructure for failed transactions processed through the ICICI gateway. This is a direct violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 and is being treated as a P0 incident internally. We are tracking this via JIRA PAY-1905.\n\nHere are the technical specifics:\n\n*   **API Endpoint:** The issue originates from the error response of the `icici_crossborder_v2/process_payment` endpoint.\n*   **Trigger Condition:** It appears that when your system returns specific error codes, notably `ICICI_ERR_51` (Invalid Card Details), the JSON response body contains the full, unmasked PAN that was sent in the initial request. Our standard logging mechanism for failed transactions was inadvertently storing this part of the response payload.\n*   **Impact:** While the volume is low—affecting approximately 0.02% of transactions that fail with this specific error code—any storage of unmasked PAN data is a critical compliance failure. This puts the entire program's go-live at significant risk.\n\nAs I mentioned in my note last week (ref: email#77d1878146f0437d), we need to be extremely diligent about data handling. To help your investigation, I've attached a document with sanitized log excerpts (file#3e0b0a0964164bad) that clearly show the response structure we are receiving.\n\nOn our side, our engineering team is already deploying an emergency hotfix to our Kubernetes-based `log-shipper` service to implement an additional regex-based masking layer specifically for this error response pattern. However, this is a temporary containment strategy and does not address the root cause, which is the data being sent from your API.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **ICICI Bank (Immediate):** Please investigate the `icici_crossborder_v2/process_payment` API's error handling logic to confirm why unmasked PANs are being returned in the response body. We need your formal acknowledgement of this issue by EOD today.\n2.  **ICICI Bank (Short-Term):** We require a committed timeline for a permanent fix to be deployed to your production environment. The fix must ensure that no sensitive cardholder data is ever returned in plain text within any API response, successful or otherwise.\n\nFrankly, the auditors have put us on a very tight deadline to demonstrate remediation. We need to show significant progress by the end of this week. Let's connect for a brief call tomorrow morning to align on your team's plan of action.\n\nAppreciate your immediate attention to this critical matter.\n\nRegards,\n\nRohit Sharma"],"timestamp":1757914200000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["anand.patel@icicibank.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on your analysis in email 80d5ad3db1ac4652, I've spent the morning investigating the API timeouts related to the RBI Cross-Border Reporting mandate implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nThe root cause is definitely the OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow with ICICI Bank's API. Our Grafana dashboard `icici-crossborder-health` shows a direct correlation between token refresh attempts and a spike in API errors. We're seeing intermittent `401 Unauthorized` and `504 Gateway Timeout` responses from their token endpoint. This is causing our p99 latency for reporting calls to jump from a stable ~350ms to over 2.5s, leading to dropped transaction reports.\n\nLooking at the Kibana logs, our service is correctly requesting a new JWT using the refresh token well before the one-hour expiry. However, ICICI's auth server is intermittently failing to respond within our configured 2-second connection timeout. This behavior directly contradicts the integration spec sheet they provided (ref: file#3e0b0a0964164bad). The error rate peaked at 4.2% this morning, which is well above our 0.1% tolerance for this critical reporting service.\n\nI've documented these findings, including relevant log snippets and a HAR file, in JIRA PAY-4510. As a temporary mitigation to prevent further data loss, I've deployed a patch to our reporting service that introduces a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for the token refresh call. This has brought the immediate failure rate down to ~0.8%, but it's a Band-Aid fix that adds unacceptable latency and masks the underlying provider issue.\n\nThis is becoming a significant blocker. The generic response we received from their support team earlier (ref: email#77d1878146f0437d) isn't sufficient. Could you please escalate this with our technical contacts at ICICI? We need them to investigate the performance degradation on their OAuth token endpoint and provide a formal RCA. Given the approaching RBI compliance deadline, we can't risk continued instability.\n\nLet's aim to get a concrete update from them by EOD tomorrow.

Building on the analysis from your email (c037bca837ae4e48), I've dug deeper into the compliance and API-level logs, and the situation with the KYC automation is a bit more concerning than we initially thought.\n\nTo summarize for everyone, the core issue is a persistent failure in our automated KYC/EDD (Enhanced Due Diligence) flow for customer segments our internal risk engine flags as 'high-risk'. This is a critical blocker for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting mandate (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603), as we cannot manually process the expected volume of these merchants without violating our agreed-upon SLAs and introducing significant audit risk.\n\nHere's what I've found:\n\n**1. Failure Metrics:** Our Grafana dashboard for the ICICI integration shows a staggering ~18% failure rate for API calls to their enhanced diligence endpoint when the payload contains a Juspay-generated risk score above 0.8. The baseline error rate for standard KYC checks remains stable at <0.2%. The p99 latency for these failed requests is also spiking to ~2.1s before timing out, suggesting a processing issue on their end.\n\n**2. API Error Analysis:** After analyzing the Kibana logs, the consistent response we're getting from ICICI's `/v2/customer/enhanced-diligence` endpoint is a `400 Bad Request` with the error code `E400-INVALID_RISK_PROFILE`. The frustrating part is that this specific error code is not documented in the API specification (file#3e0b0a0964164bad) they provided back in March. This leaves us guessing as to the root cause.\n\n**3. My Hypothesis:** My primary theory is a payload mismatch. It's possible that the data structure we send for high-risk profiles, which includes additional fields for PEP screening and adverse media checks, is not what their system expects. A secondary, but plausible, theory is an OAuth 2.0 scope issue. The JWT bearer token we generate might be scoped only for standard KYC and lacks the permissions for the enhanced diligence endpoint. We ran into a similar problem with token scopes during the initial integration, as noted in email#77d1878146f0437d.\n\nThis is a high-priority issue tracked under JIRA PAY-9624. We are currently non-compliant for this entire segment of cross-border merchants, and we cannot move forward with the UAT phase until this is resolved.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Aditya (Engineering):** Could you please have your team double-check the payload construction in our compliance module? Specifically, compare the JSON object being sent for high-risk profiles against any informal specs or examples we might have from ICICI. Let's start there.\n*   **Priya (Me):** I am escalating this with our Technical Account Manager at ICICI Bank immediately. I will reference JIRA PAY-9624 and demand formal documentation for the `E400-INVALID_RISK_PROFILE` error and confirmation on the required OAuth token scopes.\n*   **All:** I'm booking a 30-minute war-room call for 4:00 PM today to sync our findings and coordinate the debugging effort. We need a clear path to resolution before the end of the week.\n\nLet me know if you have any immediate questions.

Building on the thread from email c81bef2aa76a4f26, the intermittent failures are more severe than we initially thought and are directly impacting the RBI Cross-Border Reporting mandate implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nSuresh and Priya, bringing you into this thread for visibility and urgent assistance from the ICICI Bank side.\n\nWe're observing a critical issue with the OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow against the ICICI UAT environment. Our monitoring shows that calls to your `/oauth/token` endpoint are failing sporadically, causing a cascade failure in our reporting service. This results in timeouts when our system attempts to post data to the `/v2/reporting/submit` endpoint.\n\nHere are the specifics from our end:\n\n*   **Impact:** Our Grafana dashboard shows p99 latency for the reporting API spiking from an average of 250ms to over 2.5s during these incidents. The API error rate is jumping from a baseline of <0.1% to ~4.8% (all 504 Gateway Timeouts), which is well outside our SLA.\n*   **Logs:** Kibana logs from our Kubernetes pods show that our reporting service is failing to acquire a new JWT. We are seeing a mix of `Connection Timeout` errors and, more troublingly, `400 Bad Request` responses with an `{\"error\":\"invalid_grant\"}` payload from your auth server. These are logged under JIRA PAY-4122.\n*   **Investigation:** We have verified that our client ID and secret are correct, referencing the credentials document (file#3e0b0a0964164bad) shared initially. Our token caching layer is configured to request a new token 10 minutes before the documented 60-minute expiry, so we shouldn't be hitting an expiry race condition under normal circumstances. The behavior feels like either unannounced rate-limiting on your auth endpoint or an issue with how refresh grants are being validated, which we previously discussed in email#77d1878146f0437d.\n\nThis is a major blocker. We cannot move forward with UAT or certify compliance for the upcoming RBI deadline until this connection instability is resolved. The current failure rate means we would be unable to guarantee 100% submission of reportable transactions.\n\nCould your team please take the following actions with high priority?\n\n1.  **Investigate Logs:** Please check your auth server logs for requests originating from our staging IPs (192.0.2.10 through 192.0.2.20) for the period between 09:00 - 11:30 IST today. Look for any `invalid_grant` errors or dropped connections corresponding to our client ID.\n2.  **Confirm Configuration:** Can you re-confirm the exact token lifetime (in seconds) and any rate-limiting or velocity checks applied to our client ID on the `/oauth/token` endpoint?\n\nWe have a temporary, aggressive retry mechanism in our staging environment, but this is not a sustainable solution and will likely exacerbate the problem if it's a rate-limiting issue. We need to identify the root cause.\n\nLet’s connect for a quick 15-minute call this afternoon to sync up on findings.

Following up on that, our team is still observing critical failures and I wanted to share some more detailed metrics from our end. I'm a bit concerned about the impact on the RBI Cross-Border Reporting timeline.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards flagged a significant spike in API errors starting around 14:30 IST yesterday. Specifically, the error rate for transactions processed via the ICICI gateway jumped from a stable baseline of 0.2% to 4.5%, with p99 latency exceeding our 2.5s SLA threshold. This is a major regression from the stability we discussed last week in my summary email (ref: 77d1878146f0437d).\n\nOur engineering lead, Aditya Singh, has confirmed the root cause appears to be the OAuth token refresh mechanism. Our services are intermittently receiving `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` errors when attempting to use the refresh token against your `/oauth/token` endpoint. This is causing our Kubernetes pods to stall on new transaction requests, leading to the timeouts. We have logged this internally as JIRA PAY-1391.\n\nWe have reviewed our side and can confirm there have been no changes to our JWT generation logic or our client secret configuration. The issue seems to be isolated to the token refresh grant type within the OAuth 2.0 flow.

Building on your initial analysis in email 79f693a5756b400f, I've completed a deeper dive into the API timeouts we're experiencing with the ICICI Bank integration for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting mandate (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nThe root cause is a failure in their OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow. Our reporting service authenticates and obtains a JWT access token successfully, but upon expiry, the call to their `/oauth/token` endpoint using the provided refresh token is failing. This causes our subsequent API calls to the reporting endpoints to be sent with an expired token, resulting in a cascade of `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` responses.\n\nLooking at our Grafana metrics, the P99 latency for the `/v2/reporting/submit` endpoint spikes from a baseline of ~350ms to over 2.5s before our client times out. This has pushed the error rate for this integration to 4.8% in the last 24 hours, which is well above our 0.5% internal threshold. I have isolated the failing requests in Kibana and attached the full log trace, including request/response headers and payloads, to JIRA PAY-4814. The error from ICICI's end is a generic `invalid_grant` message, which isn't specific enough for us to debug independently.\n\nThis is becoming quite urgent. We cannot proceed with the production deployment scheduled for next week with this level of instability, as it directly impacts our ability to meet the RBI's T+1 reporting deadline. As discussed in our sync this morning, this is a critical compliance risk.\n\nAs a short-term workaround in our staging environment, I have deployed a hotfix that forces a completely new token generation every 45 minutes, well before the 60-minute token expiry. This bypasses the faulty refresh mechanism and has stabilized the reporting submissions for now. However, this is not a viable long-term solution as it increases the call volume to their authentication service and could lead to rate-limiting issues.\n\nThe core problem seems to be a discrepancy between our implementation of the refresh token grant type and ICICI's server-side expectation. Their API documentation (file#3e0b0a0964164bad) is ambiguous on the exact parameters required for the refresh flow, and it contradicts the details we discussed in earlier conversations (ref: email#77d1878146f0437d).\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Arjun (Me):** I will continue to monitor the staging environment to ensure the hotfix holds and will create a Postman collection clearly demonstrating the refresh token failure to share with ICICI.\n2.  **Aditya (You):** Could you please escalate this with our technical counterparts at ICICI Bank? We need an urgent review of the logs in JIRA PAY-4814 and a definitive clarification on their OAuth 2.0 refresh token implementation. A joint debugging session would be ideal.\n\nWe need a clear path to resolution from them by EOD tomorrow to keep the project timeline on track.

Building on the data you shared in email 189c367656ce41c5, I've dug deeper into the compliance implications of this latency spike, and it's quite concerning.\n\nFor the ICICI team's context, we are investigating a critical performance degradation in our real-time risk scoring engine, which is a core component for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting Mandate implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nHere’s a summary of our findings:\n\n**Performance Degradation:**\nOur primary Grafana dashboard (Payments Latency) showed a severe spike in P99 latency for our internal scoring API endpoint, increasing from a baseline of ~180ms to peaks of over 2.3s. This occurred yesterday between 14:20 and 15:05 IST. This directly resulted in a 3.8% transaction timeout error rate (Error Code: JUSPAY-GW-504), impacting roughly 15,000 transactions.\n\n**Internal Investigation:**\nOur SRE team has ruled out internal bottlenecks. Kubernetes pod metrics for the risk service show stable CPU/memory usage, and there were no unusual restarts or deployment events in our CI/CD pipeline during that window. A review of Kibana logs correlated by transaction ID shows that the delay originates after our system makes an outbound call to ICICI's reporting API endpoint (`/crossborder/v1/reportTxn`). Our internal processing, including JWT generation for the OAuth flow, remains under 50ms.\n\n**Compliance & Business Impact:**\nFrom a compliance perspective, this is a major red flag. These timeouts prevent us from meeting the real-time reporting requirement under the new RBI mandate. Each failed transaction creates a record-keeping gap that requires manual reconciliation, which is not sustainable and introduces risk. As per the guidelines discussed in our joint session (referencing email 77d1878146f0437d), any failure rate above 0.5% for the reporting API puts us in a non-compliant state. The full technical breakdown is being tracked in JIRA PAY-8483.\n\n**Action Items for ICICI Bank Team:**\n\n1.  Could you please urgently investigate the server-side processing logs for your `/crossborder/v1/reportTxn` endpoint for requests made from our production IP block on June 10th between 14:20 and 15:05 IST?\n2.

Can you share the P95 and P99 latency metrics as observed from your load balancers for our API calls during that period? This would help us confirm if the latency is within your infrastructure.\n\nThis is a high-priority issue for us given the looming compliance deadlines.

Here’s what I've found:\n\n1.  **API Endpoint & Error:** We are consistently seeing `504 Gateway Timeout` errors from ICICI's UAT environment, specifically on their `/kyc/v2/customer/verify` endpoint. This happens only when we submit payloads for the high-risk cohort.\n\n2.  **Performance Metrics:** Our Grafana dashboard for this integration shows a spike in the error rate from a baseline of <0.2% to 4.8% over the last 72 hours for this specific workflow. P99 latency is hitting our 2.5s timeout threshold, whereas successful calls are averaging around 450ms. This clearly indicates a processing issue on their end.\n\n3.  **Log Investigation:** I've reviewed the Kibana logs (see attached log sample in `file#3e0b0a0964164bad`), and it confirms our OAuth 2.0 flow is completing successfully and we are passing a valid JWT token in the header. The requests are reaching their gateway, but the timeout suggests their internal risk assessment or compliance check module is failing to process these complex profiles in a timely manner. This is not a connectivity or authentication issue on our side.\n\nThis failure directly impacts our ability to comply with the RBI's mandate on automated and timely customer due diligence. Manual verification at this scale is not a viable alternative and will put our project timelines at risk.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n*   **Priya:** Can you please escalate this with our technical counterparts at ICICI immediately? The previous communication trail (`email#77d1878146f0437d`) didn't result in a concrete RCA. We need them to provide server-side logs for our failed request trace IDs and confirm if their risk engine has specific configurations that are causing these timeouts. Please stress the urgency and compliance implications.\n\n*   **Aditya:** As a sanity check, could you please review our request payload structure against their latest API spec one more time? I want to be 100% certain we aren't sending a field or format that, while valid, could be triggering an edge case in their system for these specific user types.\n\nI have updated JIRA PAY-4077 with all the above findings, including links to the relevant Grafana dashboards. I'm hoping to get an official acknowledgment and investigation plan from ICICI by EOD tomorrow.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAnjali Patel"],"timestamp":1757915520000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.sharma@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

My team has reviewed the proposed flow for the multi-currency settlement process as part of our work on the RBI Cross-Border Reporting Mandate (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603), and we have a few critical technical points to align on.\n\nOur primary concern is with the Forex rate acquisition API. The proposed `/forex/v1/rates` endpoint appears to support only single transaction lookups. Our settlement process runs in batches that can exceed 100K transactions, and querying rates individually would create a significant performance bottleneck. Our initial tests against your UAT environment show a P99 latency of approximately 850ms per call, which is unfeasible for our T+1 settlement window. As outlined in the initial spec sheet (file#3e0b0a0964164bad), we require a bulk endpoint that can process an array of currency pairs to keep our processing time within acceptable limits. This is also tracked in JIRA PAY-3473.\n\nSecondly, regarding the settlement reconciliation file. The current schema is missing two mandatory fields required by our downstream reporting system: `remittance_purpose_code` and `source_of_funds_indicator`. Without these, our automated reporting module, which feeds data for regulatory filings, will fail, forcing manual intervention and jeopardizing our ability to meet the T+2 reporting deadline stipulated by the RBI. Our Grafana dashboards are configured to monitor for these fields, and their absence is currently triggering alerts.\n\nFinally, the documentation on error handling and idempotency for settlement callbacks needs clarification. If our system experiences a network partition and misses a callback, we need a clear and reliable retry mechanism from your end. More importantly, we need to ensure callbacks are idempotent to prevent duplicate processing. Can you confirm if you will be using a unique `X-Request-ID` or a similar token in the callback payload that our system can use to de-duplicate requests?\n\nI’m getting a bit anxious about the timeline here. These open items are blockers for our next deployment to the pre-production environment. We need to have this entire flow stabilized by the end of next week to proceed with final UAT.\n\nTo move forward, can your team please:\n1.  Provide an update on the feasibility and timeline for a bulk Forex rate API endpoint.\n2.  Confirm if the requested fields (`remittance_purpose_code`, `source_of_funds_indicator`) can be added to the settlement file.\n3.  Share the updated technical documentation covering the idempotency and retry logic for callbacks.\n\nI believe a quick sync call would be the most efficient way to resolve these points. I've asked my team to schedule a 45-minute technical session for tomorrow to walk through these issues. \n\nAppreciate your team's partnership on this critical project.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRohit Sharma\nBusiness Development Manager"],"timestamp":1757915640000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["priya.verma@icicibank.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on your analysis in email 455a3db32aee48b5, I've performed a deeper investigation into the UPI settlement mismatch for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting mandate implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\nI’ve analyzed the T+1 settlement files provided by ICICI via SFTP for the past 72 hours, specifically cross-referencing file#3e0b0a0964164bad with our internal transaction logs. The issue persists: we're seeing a consistent 0.7-1.2% mismatch between our confirmed UPI transaction count and the settled transactions in your report. This is directly impacting our T+1 reconciliation and pushing a subset of settlements into a manual T+2 cycle, which is not sustainable.\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Log Correlation:** Using Kibana, I've correlated the missing `pg_transaction_id`s from your report with our UPI gateway logs. Our system correctly marks these transactions as `TXN_SUCCESS` with NPCI, and our internal settlement service has them queued for reconciliation. Our p99 latency for these transactions is healthy, averaging ~350ms, well within our 99.9% uptime SLA.\n\n2.  **Root Cause Hypothesis:** The pattern points towards transactions that are either reversed or timed-out late in the settlement window (post 10:00 PM IST). My hypothesis is that the batch process generating ICICI's settlement file is not correctly ingesting the final state of these transactions from the core banking system before the file generation cutoff. This seems to align with the concerns we raised earlier in the thread (ref: email#77d1878146f0437d).\n\n3.  **API & Data Fields:** We are consuming the file as per the agreed-upon format. However, could you please confirm if the `BANK_RRN` and `TXN_STATUS` fields in your reports are guaranteed to be in their terminal state? Any ambiguity here directly compromises the data integrity required for the RBI mandate, as outlined in Doc#dd2a746550dc4774.\n\nThis reconciliation gap is now a critical blocker for our automated reporting pipeline and has been escalated internally. I have created **JIRA PAY-1755** to track this issue to resolution. The manual effort required is becoming a significant operational drag, and we are at risk of missing our internal reporting milestones for this quarter.\n\n**Action Items / Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **ICICI Team:** Can your technical team please investigate the settlement batch generation logic, focusing on how late-cycle transaction status changes are handled?\n2.  **Joint Debugging Session:** I propose we schedule an urgent technical call for tomorrow, EOD. We need key engineers from both sides who have access to the production settlement systems. We can walk through a specific set of problematic `pg_transaction_id`s to trace their lifecycle from NPCI to our respective ledgers.\n\nPlease let me know your team's availability and who the appropriate contacts would be.\n\nBest regards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757915760000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["priya.sharma@icicibank.com","aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","ravi.kumar@icicibank.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on your analysis in email dd2a746550dc4774, I’ve conducted a compliance-focused review of the KYC automation failures, and the situation is quite concerning for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting mandate (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nOur Grafana dashboards confirm your findings: we're seeing a consistent failure rate of approximately 85% for customer profiles flagged as 'high-risk' by our internal risk engine. This is a clear blocker. Standard-risk profiles are processing correctly with a 99.9% success rate and a P95 latency of 320ms, which is within our expected range.\n\nThe Kibana logs show that for these failed transactions, we are receiving an `ERR_451_RISK_FLAG` response from ICICI's `/v2/customer/enhanced-kyc` endpoint. In several instances, our service is timing out after the connection hangs for over 2.5 seconds, far exceeding the 800ms SLA defined in their spec sheet (file#3e0b0a0964164bad). I've updated JIRA PAY-6607 with detailed log snippets and a link to the relevant dashboard for our engineering team.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is a critical issue. The RBI mandate requires fully automated, real-time reporting. Relying on manual intervention for such a large segment of users is not scalable and would create significant gaps in our audit trail, putting us at risk of non-compliance. This directly contradicts the principles we laid out in Doc#3ae6ddfdf7494ca4 and our last discussion (ref: email#77d1878146f0437d).\n\nMy hypothesis is that ICICI's risk assessment for these flagged profiles triggers a secondary, more intensive check that either requires additional data fields not present in our current payload or simply has a much longer processing time that isn't documented. The OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token generation seem to be working correctly, which points to a data or processing issue on their end.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Engineering (cc'd Aditya, Rohan):** Can we please prioritize a debug session in the staging environment to trace the exact payload being sent for a failed high-risk transaction? We need to confirm we aren't missing any optional-but-critical fields.\n2.  **Vendor Management (cc'd Sameer):** Please escalate this with our technical account manager at ICICI immediately. We require an urgent explanation for the `ERR_451_RISK_FLAG` code and a confirmed SLA for these enhanced validation cases. The current documentation is insufficient.\n3.  **Myself:** I will draft a risk assessment report outlining the compliance impact of this delay and begin formulating a contingency plan, although I'm hoping we can find a technical solution first.\n\nWe need to get a clear path forward on this by EOD tomorrow.

Building on your analysis in email 3ae6ddfdf7494ca4, I've been digging into the latency spike on our real-time risk scoring engine, and the situation is quite concerning.\n\nOur primary Grafana dashboard for the RBI Cross-Border service is showing a sustained p99 latency spike for the `/v1/risk/score` endpoint. We’ve gone from a healthy baseline of ~150ms to peaks of over 2.2s in the last 45 minutes. This is causing our upstream payment processing services to time out, leading to a direct impact on ICICI bank transactions with an error rate now hovering at 3.5%. This is well outside the performance benchmarks we established in file#3e0b0a0964164bad.\n\nI've been looking through the Kibana logs, and the bottleneck appears to be happening during the enrichment phase where we fetch the remitter's purpose code. The logs show that our internal call to the new `remitter-details-service` is where the delay is originating. This service was specifically built for this RBI mandate implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\nFrom a risk and compliance perspective, this is critical.

We're now in a difficult position.\n\nOur monitoring systems lit up almost immediately after the switchover. Here's a summary of the degradation we're seeing:\n\n*   **API Latency:** The P99 latency for the `/v2/transactions/report` endpoint has spiked from our baseline of ~350ms to an average of 2.1s, with peaks hitting 2.5s. This is a ~600% increase and well outside the 800ms SLA we agreed upon in our initial spec.\n*   **Error Rates:** We're seeing a significant rise in `503 Service Unavailable` and `504 Gateway Timeout` errors, climbing from a stable 0.1% to over 2.5% during even moderate load. Our Grafana dashboards confirm this is originating from calls to your new infrastructure.\n*   **Authentication Flow:** The OAuth 2.0 token generation via `/v1/auth/token` is also experiencing intermittent latency, which is having a cascading effect on all subsequent API calls. JWT validation on our end is failing due to these timeouts.\n\nI've attached a snapshot from our Kibana logs in file#3e0b0a0964164bad which illustrates the timeout patterns. This performance level prevents us from processing transactions at the required throughput, and we are at serious risk of failing to meet the real-time reporting requirement stipulated by the RBI.\n\nOur engineering team suspects a potential resource contention or misconfiguration within your new Kubernetes cluster, possibly related to database connection pooling or ingress controller throttling under concurrent loads.

I’ve spent the morning digging into this, and it’s a bit more concerning than just a network blip.\n\nHere’s what I've found regarding Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603:\n\n**1. Impact Analysis:**\nWe are seeing intermittent but severe latency spikes on the ICICI `/v2/transactions/report` endpoint, specifically during peak reconciliation hours (2 AM - 4 AM IST). Our Grafana dashboard shows p99 latency jumping from a healthy ~250ms to over 2.5 seconds. This has pushed the error rate for this specific API from 0.2% to 4.5%, which is outside our acceptable threshold and jeopardizes our T+1 settlement reporting SLA.\n\n**2. Root Cause:**\nThe issue is not with the reporting API itself, but with the upstream OAuth 2.0 token refresh mechanism.\n*   Our auth service attempts to refresh the JWT access token using the provided refresh token just before it expires.\n*   However, we're observing that ICICI’s `/oauth/token` endpoint is intermittently returning a `503 Service Unavailable` status code.\n*   Critically, these 503 responses are missing the `Retry-After` header, so our client doesn't know when to safely retry.\n*   This failure causes our token cache to hold a stale token. When the reporting service then calls the `/v2/transactions/report` endpoint, it receives a `401 Unauthorized` and enters a retry loop, which ultimately times out. Kibana logs from our Kubernetes auth-proxy pod clearly show this sequence. I've linked the query in JIRA PAY-3390.\n\n**3. Immediate Mitigation (Staging Deployed):**\nTo prevent this from impacting the production environment again tonight, I’ve deployed a hotfix to our staging cluster.\n*   I've implemented a more resilient retry policy for the `/oauth/token` endpoint with exponential backoff (starting at 100ms and capped at 1s).\n*   I've also added a circuit breaker. If the token refresh fails three consecutive times, our service will automatically request a new, short-lived token as a fallback, bypassing the problematic refresh token temporarily. This is based on the contingency plan we discussed in Doc#61bf427fbe444504.\n\nThis should contain the blast radius and keep our error rate below 1% even if ICICI's auth service continues to be unstable.\n\n**4. Action Items & Next Steps:**\nThis workaround isn't a permanent solution. A stable auth flow is a non-negotiable requirement for this RBI mandate.\n\n*   **[Action for ICICI]** We need Rahul Verma's team at ICICI to urgently investigate the underlying cause of the `503` errors on their `/oauth/token` service. This is the top priority.\n*   **[Action for Arjun]** I will monitor the staging environment's performance over the next 12 hours. Assuming it's stable, I will open a CR for an emergency production deployment by 8 PM IST tonight.\n*   **[Action for Priya]** Could you please follow up with Rahul and the ICICI team on this, referencing this email and JIRA PAY-3390?

Building on your findings in email 61bf427fbe444504, I've dug deeper into the compliance implications of this cross-border routing issue with ICICI Bank, and I'm flagging this as a critical risk.\n\nThe core problem is that a subset of international transactions are being incorrectly routed through our domestic processing endpoint (`icici/v2/payments/domestic/initiate`) instead of the required `icici/v2/payments/crossborder/initiate` endpoint. This directly impacts our work on the RBI Cross-Border Reporting Mandate (Work ID: c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\n**Technical & Compliance Impact:**\n\n1.  **Data Integrity Failure:** Kibana logs confirm that transactions with specific foreign-currency MCCs are being misclassified. For example, looking at the past 12 hours, I can see transactions with `transaction.origin.country != 'IN'` being processed without the necessary `purposeCode` and `remittanceDetails` objects. This is a direct violation of the reporting format specified in the RBI guidelines (ref: file#3e0b0a0964164bad).\n\n2.  **API & Monitoring Discrepancy:** Our Grafana dashboard for 'ICICI Gateway Health' is showing a worrying trend. While our overall TPS is stable, the error rate for the ICICI cross-border leg has spiked to 4.5% from a baseline of 0.2%. The predominant error code is `ICICI-CB-402: INCOMPLETE_REPORTING_DATA`. This confirms that even when some transactions are routed correctly, the subsequent reporting submission is failing due to missing data fields that should have been captured at initiation.\n\n3.  **Root Cause Hypothesis:** I suspect this stems from a configuration update pushed to the payment routing service last evening. The timing correlates perfectly with the start of the error spike. It seems the rule set for ICICI Bank was partially overwritten, causing the router to default to domestic logic for ambiguous MCCs, which was a fallback we removed two sprints ago.\n\n**Action Items & Urgency:**\n\nThis is a time-sensitive compliance issue. The misreporting, even for a short period, requires rectification and could trigger regulatory scrutiny. We need to act immediately.\n\n*   **Engineering (Rohan):** Please initiate an immediate investigation into the CI/CD pipeline for the payment router service. We need to identify the specific commit that caused this and why the safeguards failed. Please escalate as needed. I've updated JIRA PAY-8224 with these specifics.\n\n*   **SRE Team:** Can we get a hotfix prepared to restore the previous correct routing configuration? We can’t afford to wait for the next deployment cycle. The business impact is too high.\n\n*   **Compliance (Self-Assigned):** I will need a complete list of all affected `transaction_ids` from the moment the issue started. I have to prepare a data remediation plan and assess the scope of the incorrect reporting to the RBI. I also need to draft a communication to our contacts at ICICI Bank to preemptively address any reconciliation queries from their end.\n\nLet’s convene for a quick 15-minute sync-up this afternoon to align on the hotfix timeline.

The issue seems to be a systemic mismatch between the foreign exchange rates we receive from ICICI’s `ForexRateQuote` API endpoint and the final rates applied in the EOD settlement files we receive via SFTP. The Kibana logs for our `reconciliation-service` are flooded with `RECON_MISMATCH_FX_RATE` errors, specifically for transactions in USD and EUR. Our Grafana dashboard for cross-border settlements confirms this, showing a spike in the `failed_settlement_volume` to 12.8% of the total batch—far above our 0.5% tolerance threshold.\n\nThis directly impacts our ability to meet the RBI's T+1 reporting mandate. If our reconciliation service can't automatically clear these transactions, it triggers a manual review process that simply won't scale and will cause us to miss the reporting window. This is the primary risk for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603.\n\nAs I recall from our initial technical discussion with the ICICI team (referenced in my notes from email#77d1878146f0437d), the rate provided via the API was supposed to be locked for a 60-second window, which should have been sufficient for transaction authorization. The discrepancies we're seeing suggest this lock isn't being honored, or there's another post-processing step on their end that's altering the final rate. The spec sheet we co-authored (file#3e0b0a0964164bad) is very clear on this requirement.\n\nI've updated the primary JIRA ticket PAY-9717 with these findings. We need to get some clarity from ICICI urgently. \n\nHere are my proposed action items:\n\n1.  **Aditya:** Can you please raise a severity-1 ticket with the ICICI technical team today? We need a definitive answer on their FX rate-locking mechanism and an explanation for the discrepancies. Please request logs from their system for our sample of failed transaction IDs.\n2.  **Dev Team (via Aditya):** While we await ICICI’s response, can we investigate implementing a temporary, configurable tolerance threshold for these FX mismatches? It's not ideal from a financial reconciliation standpoint, but it might be our only path to automated RBI reporting in the short term. We can set it to a very low value, say 5 basis points, and flag any larger deviations for manual review.\n3.  **Anjali (Me):** I will prepare a risk assessment summary for the leadership team, outlining the potential for a compliance breach and our proposed mitigation strategy.\n\nWe need to get this resolved by the end of this week to stay on track. Let's schedule a quick sync for tomorrow morning to discuss their response.

Building on your email (ref: 3f3e6a003bbe4105), it's clear the intermittent timeouts we're seeing are directly tied to the OAuth token refresh flow with ICICI's UAT environment.\n\nThis is becoming a critical blocker for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting Mandate project (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603). The reporting submissions are failing, which puts our pre-launch compliance testing in jeopardy.\n\nHere’s a summary of what our team has observed:\n\n1.  **Issue:** Our reporting service is experiencing a high rate of `504 Gateway Timeout` errors when making API calls to ICICI's reporting endpoints. The issue is specifically with refreshing the OAuth 2.0 access token via the `/oauth/token` endpoint.\n2.  **Performance Impact:** Our Grafana metrics show a significant degradation. P99 latency for these API calls has spiked from a baseline of ~350ms to over 2.5s. The error rate escalated from a nominal 0.1% to 4.8% during the peak testing window yesterday (approx. 15:00-16:00 IST).\n3.  **Our Investigation:** As detailed in JIRA ticket PAY-3241, we have validated our JWT generation and signing logic against the shared specification (ref: file#3e0b0a0964164bad). Our Kibana logs confirm that our requests are correctly formatted but are timing out while awaiting a response from your server. We have implemented a temporary client-side retry mechanism, but this is not a viable long-term solution as it adds unacceptable latency.\n\nAnand, could your team please prioritize an investigation on your end? Specifically, we need you to check the server-side logs for the `/oauth/token` endpoint for requests originating from our staging IP range. Any signs of resource contention, database connection pool exhaustion, or errors in your authentication service would be extremely helpful.\n\nThis issue has halted our progress on integration testing. We urgently need to get this resolved to stay on track for the mandate's deadline.\n\n**Action Items:**\n*   **ICICI Team (Anand):** Please investigate the server-side logs for the OAuth service and provide an update by EOD today.\n*   **Juspay Team (Aditya):** Please prepare a log sample of the failed requests to share with the ICICI team for cross-verification.\n\nI’d like to schedule a 30-minute technical sync-up call for tomorrow morning to review the findings. I will send a separate invite.\n\nRegards,\n\nRohit Sharma\nBusiness Development Manager\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757917080000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["anand.verma@icicibank.com","aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.kapoor@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

I've investigated the spike in transaction failures and can confirm we had a critical routing configuration issue tied to the RBI cross-border mandate implementation (Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603).\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nBetween approximately 14:15 and 14:45 IST today, a new routing rule deployed via our CI/CD pipeline incorrectly directed a subset of cross-border transactions to a deprecated endpoint at ICICI, bypassing the new RBI-compliant `/payments/v3/initiate_crossborder` flow. My review of the Kibana logs (index: `payment-router-prod-*`) shows a surge in `HTTP 404 Not Found` and `HTTP 502 Bad Gateway` responses from the ICICI side for transactions originating from the US and UK (MCC codes 5812, 5814).\n\nOur primary Grafana dashboard for the ICICI gateway showed a corresponding spike in P99 latency from a baseline of ~210ms to over 2.1s, with the transaction failure rate hitting 4.8% for the affected cohort. This was a clear violation of our 99.95% uptime SLA for this integration. The issue is tracked under JIRA PAY-8302.\n\n**Immediate Action Taken:**\nI've rolled back the `payment-router-service` deployment in our production Kubernetes cluster to the last known stable version (`v2.1.4-stable`). The rollback was completed at 14:48 IST. Metrics have since returned to nominal levels: P99 latency is stable at ~225ms and the error rate is back below 0.2%.\n\n**Impact on RBI Reporting:**\nUnfortunately, the transactions that failed during this window will not have the required `purposeCode` and `remitterDetails` captured as per the RBI mandate outlined in `file#3e0b0a0964164bad`. The finance team will need to perform a manual reconciliation for approximately 3,500 failed transactions to ensure our T+1 settlement and reporting files are accurate. I have already provided them with a CSV export of the affected `order_id`s.\n\n**Next Steps & Prevention:**\n1.  **CI/CD Guardrails:** I am adding a pre-deployment validation step to our pipeline that explicitly checks the routing configuration against a schema of approved endpoints. This will prevent a similar misconfiguration from reaching production again. This is being added to the scope of PAY-8302.\n2.  **Clarification for ICICI Team (cc Rahul):** Rahul, could you please confirm the idempotency behavior of the new `/payments/v3/initiate_crossborder` endpoint? If we were to retry these failed transactions with the correct details, would they be processed without risk of double-debiting? Understanding this will guide our recovery strategy. The discussion in email `77d1878146f0437d` about idempotency keys seems relevant here.\n\nApologies for the disruption. The fix is stable, and we are working to mitigate the downstream reporting impact. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nBest,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757917380000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","rahul.verma@icicibank.com","compliance-team@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on your analysis in email 999de38ded794a36, I've dug deeper into the compliance implications, and the situation is now a critical risk for the project.\n\nThe performance bottleneck following ICICI Bank’s core banking system migration is a direct threat to our go-live for the RBI Cross-Border Reporting mandate. Our load tests from last night confirm the degradation is severe. The Grafana dashboard for payment-services shows P99 latency for the `/v2/report/crossborder` endpoint spiking to over 2.5 seconds, up from a baseline of ~180ms, as soon as we cross the 400 TPS mark. This is nowhere near the 1.5K TPS we had benchmarked pre-migration.\n\nKibana logs are showing a flood of `503 Service Unavailable` and intermittent `408 Request Timeout` errors from their gateway. This strongly suggests their new backend infrastructure cannot scale to meet the committed transaction volume. The error rate peaked at 4.7% during the test window, which is completely unacceptable for a critical reporting function. I've updated JIRA PAY-3106 with the latest logs and metrics.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is a red alert. A 4.7% failure rate means we could miss reporting thousands of transactions daily. Per the RBI mandate, these reports must be submitted in a T+1 window. Failing to do so consistently will result in significant regulatory penalties and a mandatory audit. The failed submissions are missing critical fields specified in the reporting schema (file#3e0b0a0964164bad), such as `purpose_code` and `remitter_id`.\n\nWhile our SRE team is investigating a potential dead-letter queue for failed submissions, this is a temporary patch, not a fix. We cannot go live with this level of instability.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **ICICI Bank:** We need a formal Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and a concrete action plan from their technical team by EOD tomorrow. This is non-negotiable.\n2.  **Juspay (SRE):** Please continue scoping the effort for the dead-letter queue and an enhanced retry logic as a contingency, but we must be clear this is a fallback.\n3.  **Me:** I will draft a formal communication to our relationship manager at ICICI, referencing our SLA and highlighting the compliance risk. This is a follow-up to my earlier note (email#77d1878146f0437d).\n\nThis issue is the single biggest blocker for Work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603.

The full investigation details are documented in JIRA PAY-7374.\n\nHere’s what we’re observing:\n\nOur system successfully obtains a JWT access token and reports transactions as expected. However, when the token expires, the subsequent call to your token refresh endpoint is failing. This is causing all subsequent API calls to `/v2/reporting/transactions` to fail with what appears on our end as a connection timeout, as our service awaits a valid response.\n\nLooking at our Grafana metrics, the P99 latency for this specific API call has spiked from a baseline of ~250ms to over 2.5 seconds before timing out. The error rate is now hovering around 4.5%, a significant jump from our usual <0.1%. Our Kibana logs confirm that our requests are being sent correctly, but we're not receiving a valid token in return, leading to authentication failures.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is becoming critical. We are now accumulating a backlog of transactions that are failing to be reported to the regulator via your platform. This puts us at risk of non-compliance with the RBI mandate for work ID c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603. Manually processing this backlog is not a viable long-term fix and introduces its own operational risks.\n\nTo move forward, could your team please:\n\n1.  **Investigate your OAuth service logs** immediately for errors corresponding to our refresh token requests. We suspect the issue might be with the token validation or expiry logic on your end.\n2.  **Provide an ETA for a resolution.** We need to communicate a clear timeline to our internal compliance and leadership teams.\n3.  **Explore a temporary workaround.** Is it possible for you to manually extend the validity of our current access token, or is there an alternative authentication method we could fall back on to clear the reporting backlog?\n\nI've attached a log snippet (file#3e0b0a0964164bad) showing the failed refresh attempt for your team's reference.

This directly impacted the pilot for the RBI cross-border reporting flow (JIRA: PAY-3252) and triggered several high-priority alerts on the SRE dashboard.\n\nMy initial investigation points to the new feature flag `enable-euler-risk-enrichment`. The Grafana dashboard (Risk Services - p99 Latency) showed our latency jumping from a baseline of ~120ms to over 2.1s for a 15-minute window. It looks like the synchronous API call to the Euler ledger service to fetch historical transaction data for risk assessment couldn't handle the load during peak processing (~20k TPS). We had to roll back the deployment `deploy-risk-v1.3.2` to restore stability. This seems like a classic database contention issue under load.\n\nThe agenda is to confirm this root cause and agree on a path forward. We can't have the core payment path blocked by a synchronous call to a heavy ledger system.

The goal is to get all requirements locked down so I can create the deployment config file and we can start staging environment setup next week.\n\nMy initial review of the draft spec (Confluence: 'RBI Cross-Border Reporting - Technical Spec') raises a few points. The service needs to query our Euler ledger for multi-currency settlement data. We'll likely need read-access to the `euler-prod-replica` BigQuery dataset. Can we confirm the exact tables and columns? We need to create a specific IAM service account with least-privilege access. Also, what’s the expected data volume per report and frequency? This will influence the pod size and memory allocation in our Kubernetes cluster (payments-prod-gke-2).\n\nProposed agenda and action items to come out of this meeting:\n1. Finalize Data Source Access: Ravi, can you pinpoint the exact BigQuery views we need? I think just querying the materialized view `vw_multicurrency_settlements_daily` should be sufficient.\n2. Define Monitoring & Alerting: Let's agree on the key Prometheus metrics. I suggest `juspay_rbi_report_generation_duration_seconds` and `icici_api_submission_latency_seconds`. I'll set up Grafana alerts for any submission failures (error codes > 500) or p99 latency above 3s.\n3. Clarify Vendor API Constraints: Vikram, can you confirm the rate limits and any IP whitelisting requirements for the reporting submission endpoint on ICICI's side? We need to know this to configure our egress gateway.\n4. Action Plan: By the end of this call, we should have owners and ETAs for provisioning IAM roles, finalizing the metric definitions, and getting the network requirements from ICICI. I will then update the main Confluence page with these decisions, which will be the source of truth for the deployment script (next step).\n\nkeywords: RBI reporting, deployment, Kubernetes, GKE, IAM, BigQuery, Euler ledger, ICICI Bank, monitoring, Grafana, Prometheus","status":"confirmed","createdAt":1694002931000,"updatedAt":1694002931000,"app":"google-calendar","entity":"event","creator":{"displayName":"Arjun Mehta","email":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in"},"startTime":1694086200000,"endTime":1694089800000,"joiningLink":"https://meet.google.com/xyz-pdq-abc","permissions":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","ravi.kumar@juspay.in","saanvi.gupta@juspay.in","vikram.singh@icicibank.com"]}},

The impact is directly tied to our RBI compliance obligations under JIRA epic PAY-4210, so we need a clear path forward.\n\nHere’s a summary of my initial findings from our monitoring stack:\n- **Observation:** The p99 latency for our `icici-reporting-adapter` service's `submitReport` endpoint has spiked from a baseline of ~400ms to over 3.5s. This is causing our service-level timeouts to trigger, resulting in a ~4% error rate during peak reporting windows.\n- **Correlation:** Looking at the Grafana dashboard linked in Confluence, these latency spikes align perfectly with ICICI's confirmed migration cutover time. The issue is most severe during our hourly batch submission job, which processes a high volume of transactions.\n- **Analysis:** I ran a few traces through Kibana. It looks like our connection pool to their endpoint is getting exhausted. A quick test where we increased the pool size didn't help; it just resulted in more `504 Gateway Timeout` errors, which suggests the bottleneck is on their end and not ours.\n\nMy hypothesis is that their new backend can't handle the bursty traffic from our batch job. It might be an undocumented concurrency limit or just slower processing per request. The goal of this meeting is to validate this theory and define concrete action items for mitigation and a long-term fix.\n\nProposed next steps for discussion:\n1.  **Short-term Mitigation:** Can Rohan implement a temporary throttling mechanism within the adapter, maybe with a configurable feature flag like `ENABLE_ICICI_REPORTING_THROTTLING`? This would introduce a small delay between API calls within a single batch, spreading the load.\n2.  **Vendor Investigation:** Sandeep, can you please take this back to your core banking team? We need to know if they see corresponding errors in their logs or if there are new, stricter rate limits we're not aware of. Access to their performance logs for that endpoint would be ideal.\n3.  **Compliance:** Anjali, we need to document this incident and our mitigation plan for our audit trail.\n\nkeywords: rbi, reporting, latency, timeout, icici, cbs, adapter, feature flag, pay-4210, bottleneck","status":"confirmed","createdAt":1757925480000,"updatedAt":1757927280000,"app":"google-calendar","entity":"event","creator":{"displayName":"Arjun Mehta","email":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in"},"startTime":1757940600000,"endTime":1757944200000,"joiningLink":"https://meet.google.com/xyz-abcd-efg","permissions":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","rohan.desai@juspay.in","anjali.rao@juspay.in","sandeep.verma@icicibank.com"]}},

This is directly impacting the transaction flow for the new RBI cross-border reporting feature and is tracked under JIRA PAY-8390.\n\nThe issue seems localized to transactions requiring real-time forex conversion lookups via ICICI's API. Our Grafana dashboard (snapshot attached in the previous email thread) shows p99 latency jumping from a baseline of ~400ms to over 2.1s during peak loads yesterday. Kibana logs from the risk-engine pods correlate these spikes with requests containing complex payloads for LRS (Liberalised Remittance Scheme) reporting. My hypothesis is either an inefficient serialization of the request on our end or a potential bottleneck/rate-limiting on ICICI's forex API endpoint when hit with these new payload types.\n\nAgenda for this call:\n1.  **Root Cause Analysis:** Priya, can you quickly walk us through the code path in the HyperSDK service that constructs this API call? Sandeep, could you please check ICICI's ingress logs for our requests around 14:30 IST yesterday to see if you observed any throttling or errors?\n2.  **Short-Term Mitigation Strategy:** I'm proposing we implement a circuit breaker with an aggressive timeout (maybe 850ms) for this specific dependency. This would allow the core payment to proceed even if the forex lookup fails, but we need to confirm the compliance implications with Anjali.\n3.  **Long-Term Fix & Action Plan:** We need to decide on a permanent solution. Options could be caching forex rates with a short TTL (e.g., 60s) or refactoring to use a batch/bulk lookup API if ICICI provides one. We will assign owners and ETAs for the chosen path.\n\nLet's aim to leave this meeting with a clear set of action items documented in the Confluence page for PAY-8390.","status":"confirmed","createdAt":1757925120000,"updatedAt":1757925120000,"app":"google-calendar","entity":"event","creator":{"displayName":"Arjun Mehta","email":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in"},"startTime":1757926920000,"endTime":1757930520000,"joiningLink":"https://meet.google.com/qwe-rtyu-iop","permissions":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","rahul.verma@juspay.in","anjali.desai@juspay.in","sandeep.gupta@icicibank.com"]}},

Our Grafana dashboards show our outbound traffic spiking to 140 TPS, while ICICI's documented limit is a hard 100 TPS, causing a backlog in our transient reporting database and jeopardizing our T+1 reporting SLA for the RBI mandate.","To mitigate this, we are introducing a token bucket rate-limiting algorithm using a shared Redis instance within the `pl-prod` Kubernetes cluster.

During peak UPI transaction windows (observed between 18:00-20:00 IST), the `/v2/tx/score` endpoint latency increased from a baseline of 75ms to over 600ms. This directly correlates with a spike in `ReadIOPS` saturation on the db.r5.4xlarge replica instances, as seen in our Grafana dashboards. The complex, multi-join queries executed by Inferno, which cross-reference the `transaction_history`, `device_fingerprints`, and `merchant_velocity` tables, are consuming excessive read capacity, causing resource starvation for other critical path services and resulting in downstream transaction failures with the internal error code `ERR_RISK_TIMEOUT`.","From a compliance perspective for the RBI Data Localization audit, this instability in a critical fraud detection component is unacceptable. A failure to generate a risk score within the transaction SLO is a material weakness. The current architecture couples the analytical query load of the risk engine with the operational read load of the core payment processing flow, creating a single point of contention. This design does not provide the service isolation necessary to guarantee performance for critical compliance functions under stress, a likely point of inquiry by NPCI auditors.","The immediate recommendation is to implement a circuit breaker in the Go-based microservice that calls Inferno. If a response from `/v2/tx/score` is not received within a 250ms threshold, the system should fall back to a default, conservative risk assessment (e.g., medium-risk) and asynchronously flag the transaction ID in a Kafka topic (`risk.fallback.log`) for ex-post-facto batch analysis. The long-term, strategic solution involves decoupling the risk engine's data source completely. Engineering must provision a dedicated ScyllaDB cluster to house a denormalized, read-optimized projection of the required risk-scoring data. An ETL process using Debezium for Change Data Capture (CDC) from the primary Aurora cluster will maintain data freshness in near-real-time, ensuring Inferno has a dedicated, high-throughput data layer that is fully isolated from the main transactional database."],"owner":"Priya Nair","ownerEmail":"priya.nair@juspay.in","photoLink":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/photo5","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.nair@juspay.in","tech-leads@juspay.in","product-team@juspay.in","compliance@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"application/json","createdAt":1757910600000,"updatedAt":1757910600000}},

Building on the initial analysis in file b54760f88f254a8f, I've identified that our end-of-day batch processing for FX rates doesn't meet the requirement for real-time, transaction-level data storage within our India-based data centers.\n\nCurrently, the `Recon-Engine` service ingests a daily flat file for FX conversion, leading to a T+1 settlement cycle for these transactions. The primary issue is that the transaction-specific FX rate and associated metadata are not captured and stored locally at the point of authorization. This creates a significant data residency risk and a weak audit trail, which will definitely be flagged. Our `Settlement-Recon-Dashboard` in Grafana already shows a persistent 0.15% discrepancy rate on cross-border transactions, which is likely tied to rate volatility between the transaction time and batch settlement.\n\nThe proposed solution, tracked under JIRA PAY-7809, is to deprecate the file-based process and integrate our core UPI gateway with a real-time FX rate API. This ensures that every multi-currency transaction is enriched with a precise, timestamped conversion rate that is immediately persisted in our primary Aurora DB cluster in Mumbai.\n\nAction Items:\n\n1.  **Rohan (Engineering):** Please prioritize the integration of the `FX-Rate-v3/quote` endpoint.

The p99 latency for the `/v2/risk/score` endpoint escalated from a baseline of ~180ms to a peak of 950ms.\n*   **System Impact:** Our UPI gateway Grafana dashboard showed a corresponding increase in transaction timeouts (Error Code: 504), moving from our typical 0.1% to 0.4%. While this seems minor, at our peak TPS of ~40K, this affected a significant volume of transactions.\n*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Kibana logs strongly suggest the issue stems from increased I/O wait times on our primary Redis cluster. This appears to be linked to a new fraud detection model deployed at 16:20 IST. The new model seems to have introduced several complex, multi-key lookup operations that are creating contention under load. This is further detailed in JIRA PAY-2273.\n\nFrom a business and compliance perspective, this event is concerning. The RBI audit will closely scrutinize our end-to-end transaction processing times.

This resulted in a spike of `U69` (Transaction not permitted) error codes from NPCI's API between 14:00 and 17:00 IST.\n\nKibana logs confirm that card BINs designated for international processing were being funneled through the domestic flow, which directly contravenes the data residency requirements we are working to certify. The Grafana dashboard 'NPCI Error Rates by Txn Type' clearly shows this anomaly, with p99 latency for the failed transactions hitting ~1800ms before timing out.\n\nThis appears to have been introduced in the last CI/CD deployment. The regex for domestic BIN matching seems to be overly permissive. I've updated JIRA PAY-7383 with the detailed logs and dashboard screenshots.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Hotfix:** The DevOps team needs to roll back the config map for `payment-router-v2.1` to the last known-good state, which is documented in `file#b54760f88f254a8f`.\n2.  **Preventative Measures:** Can you please sync with the SRE team to implement a pre-deployment validation step in the pipeline?

This is a material deviation from our acceptable baseline of <1.5% and directly jeopardizes our compliance posture.\n\nFrom a technical and compliance perspective:\n\n1.  **Audit Trail Integrity:** A 4.2% false positive rate generates an unacceptably high volume of incorrectly blocked transactions (flagged with internal code `F403_SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY`). This pollutes our audit logs, which are a primary artifact for RBI examination. During our mock audit drills (ref: file#b54760f88f254a8f), any anomaly above 2% was flagged as a critical finding. We are now well past that threshold.\n\n2.  **System Impact:** Kibana logs show these incorrect blocks are adding ~45ms of latency to the p99 response time for the UPI gateway's `/v2/payments/authorize` endpoint, as the system processes the exception flow. While minor, it's an unnecessary performance degradation.\n\n3.  **Root Cause:** The issue appears correlated with the new feature vectors in the v2.3 model, as hypothesized in email#68cf918d82794e14.

This issue seems to be isolated to error responses originating from the NPCI UPI gateway. \n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n*   **Source:** The leakage is occurring when our system processes failed transaction responses from the NPCI `/v2/transaction/process/upi` endpoint.\n*   **Error Codes:** The issue is consistently reproducible with transactions failing with NPCI-specific error codes U30 (Invalid VPA), U39 (Authentication Failed), and U68 (Timed Out).\n*   **Root Cause Hypothesis:** It appears our logging interceptor, running as a sidecar in our Kubernetes payment processing pods, is capturing the raw JSON payload from NPCI *before* our internal PAN masking service is invoked for these specific failure scenarios. For successful transactions (status `SUCCESS`), the masking logic works as expected.\n*   **Impact:** Our Grafana dashboards indicate this affects approximately 0.15% of our total UPI transaction volume, which, while a small percentage, represents a severe compliance breach. We have already quarantined the affected log shards as of 10:30 AM IST today.\n\n**Action Items:**\n1.  **[Juspay - Eng] Aditya:** Please prioritize JIRA PAY-4083. The immediate task is to deploy a hotfix that ensures our masking service processes all API responses from the NPCI gateway, irrespective of the HTTP status code or transaction outcome. We cannot have any unmasked PAN data touching our persistent logging infrastructure. Target for staging deployment is EOD today.\n2.  **[NPCI Team]** Can you please confirm if there have been any recent, unannounced changes to the error response object structure for the `/v2/transaction/process/upi` endpoint? Our parser might be failing to correctly identify the payload as a standard transaction response in these edge cases, causing it to bypass the masking flow. The log snippets in `file#b54760f88f254a8f` show the exact structure we are receiving.\n\nWe need to present a complete Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and remediation plan to the auditors by COB tomorrow. Our internal teams are already mobilized to deploy a fix. Your prompt confirmation on the API response structure is critical for us to complete our analysis.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757914320000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["npc-tech-support@npci.org.in","aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","rahul.verma@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX","IMPORTANT"]}},

This directly impacts the RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness Program (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576) and confirms the data integrity risks we discussed in email c3969bce4ec34924.\n\nOur internal settlement system is showing a shortfall of approximately ₹4.7 Lakhs against the consolidated transaction report from NPCI. The engineering team has traced the discrepancy to a period between 16:00 and 16:45 IST yesterday. During this window, our Grafana dashboards showed p99 latency from NPCI's `/upi/payment/status` endpoint spiking from our baseline of ~250ms to over 2.1s. This resulted in a series of transaction timeouts logged in Kibana under error code `U_TIMEOUT`.\n\nMy hypothesis, which is also documented in JIRA PAY-5078, is that our reconciliation service is incorrectly flagging these timed-out transactions as definitive failures. However, it seems likely that NPCI's system eventually processed a subset of these payments successfully, but our system failed to poll for the final status update due to the timeout. This has created a state mismatch between our ledger and NPCI's, which is a critical finding we must resolve before the audit.\n\nThis issue not only presents a financial reconciliation challenge but also a direct compliance violation under RBI's guidelines, which mandate end-to-end transactional integrity and accurate audit trails stored locally.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Saanvi (Engineering Lead):** Can your team please run a script to cross-reference all transaction IDs marked with `U_TIMEOUT` during the incident window against the final settlement file from NPCI (ref: file#b54760f88f254a8f)?

It seems the root cause was a misconfiguration in our payment routing logic deployed yesterday at 14:30 IST as part of the RBI Data Localization program (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576).\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\nA new routing rule, intended to ensure all domestic UPI transactions are processed exclusively within India, was overly restrictive. It looks like it incorrectly flagged a subset of legitimate international transactions originating from specific BIN ranges as domestic, attempting to route them through the standard domestic NPCI gateway instead of the designated cross-border endpoint. \n\nOur Kibana logs show these transactions failing at the pre-processing stage with an internal error code `GW-ROUTE-FAIL-04` before even hitting the NPCI switch. The corresponding response sent to merchants was a generic `502 Bad Gateway`, masking the underlying issue. The Grafana dashboard for the UPI gateway shows the error rate for the `/v2/payments/initiate` endpoint spiking to 4.5% between 14:30 and 17:00 IST yesterday, compared to our baseline of <0.1%. P99 latency for these failed requests remained low at ~120ms, which confirms a fast-fail at our end.\n\nThe problematic configuration is located in the `routing_rules_v3.json` file, which was part of the last CI/CD push. The change has been isolated and is documented in JIRA PAY-8722.\n\n**Action Items:**\n1.  **Immediate:** The dev team has initiated a rollback of the specific rule change in the staging environment. We expect to push the hotfix to production by 18:00 IST today after completing regression tests. \n2.  **NPCI Team:** Can you please confirm from your logs if you observed any malformed requests or an increase in rejections from our IP block during the impacted window? This would help validate our findings.\n3.  **Post-Mortem:** We need to schedule a post-mortem to refine the validation logic for routing rules to prevent recurrence. This is critical for our overall audit readiness.\n\nWe will monitor the system closely post-deployment and provide an update by EOD.

This directly threatens our ability to demonstrate system stability and scalability as required by RBI guidelines.\n\nBuilding on the initial flags raised in email 234bfe70b6504ad4, our monitoring shows the situation has worsened. The UPI gateway is seeing a high volume of `HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)` responses from NPCI’s `/v2/upi/payment/initiate` endpoint. Our Grafana dashboards (UPI-Gateway-Performance) confirm that peak hour transaction throughput (4 PM - 7 PM IST) has degraded by approximately 18%, dropping from a stable 650 TPS to an unstable 530 TPS. This has pushed our p95 latency to 850ms, far exceeding the 400ms internal SLA.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, we cannot go into an RBI audit with this level of vendor-induced throttling. It presents a material weakness in our payment processing pipeline and will almost certainly be flagged as a control deficiency. I have initiated the formal documentation for this risk under JIRA PAY-3985 and attached a preliminary impact assessment as `file#b54760f8f254a8f`.\n\nAction Items:\n\n1.  **Aditya Singh:** Please formally escalate this to our technical account manager at NPCI immediately. We need a permanent increase in our rate limit to a minimum of 1000 TPS to ensure we have an adequate buffer for peak loads and future growth.

This coincides with a transaction error rate jump from 0.2% to a sustained 4.5%, primarily consisting of HTTP 504 Gateway Timeouts.\n\nThe root cause appears to be an intermittent failure in our OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow with NPCI's authentication service. Kibana logs from our token management service pods show frequent connection timeouts and 'Invalid Grant' errors when calling the NPCI `/token` endpoint to refresh our JWT. This isn't entirely new, as noted in email 68cf918d82794e14, but the failure frequency has increased by an order of magnitude, especially during our afternoon peak of ~25K TPS.\n\nThis level of service degradation is unacceptable and presents a significant risk for the RBI audit. Demonstrating system stability and reliability is paramount, and the current state will be a major red flag in our audit logs, potentially violating the operational resilience requirements.\n\nImmediate Action Items:\n1.  **Aditya:** Please lead a war room with the SRE and payments-infra teams to determine if this is a network issue, a misconfiguration in our client, or rate-limiting on NPCI's side.

Specifically, the NGINX ingress controller logs capture the first 256 characters of the Authorization header, which includes sensitive portions of the token signature. This is a direct violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.2 concerning the storage of sensitive authentication data post-authorization.\n\nOur investigation via Kibana shows this affects the endpoint handling token validation with NPCI and impacts approximately 15% of our total transaction volume, peaking at 12,000 TPS. While the full token is not stored, the exposure of the signature fragment is classified as a 'High' severity finding by our auditors. The relevant log patterns and analysis are detailed in file#b54760f88f254a8f.\n\nThis is now tracked under JIRA PAY-1345 and is a blocker for audit sign-off.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Juspay SRE (Owner: Rohan Verma):** Deploy an immediate hotfix to the ingress controller configuration to completely mask the Authorization header from all access logs. **Deadline: Today, 6 PM IST.**\n2.  **Juspay Security (Owner: Priya Sharma):** Initiate a full log purge protocol for the affected Kibana indices, to be executed within 48 hours of the hotfix deployment and validation.\n3.  **NPCI Team (Owner: NPCI Counterpart):** Please review your API integration guidelines.

All transactions received a final success confirmation through the NPCI callback mechanism.\n2.  **Performance Metrics:** The Grafana dashboard for our UPI processing cluster shows stable performance during the impacted window. P95 latency for the payment processing endpoints remained below 250ms, well within our 400ms SLA. This rules out performance degradation as a root cause.\n3.  **Hypothesis:** The leading theory, expanding on the initial thoughts in email dc205f8dac974583, is a timing issue related to NPCI's `U91` (Transaction Pending) response code. It appears these transactions were resolved to 'SUCCESS' via asynchronous callbacks very close to NPCI's settlement file generation cutoff. Our system correctly reconciled the final state, but the transactions missed inclusion in NPCI's settlement batch for that cycle.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, a recurring delta between our internal ledger and the NPCI settlement file is a critical audit failure point.

While our primary OAuth 2.0 flows are secure, Priya's team has confirmed via Kibana logs that in certain edge cases (approximately 0.5% of transaction volume, peaking at 1.2% during off-hours), our Kubernetes pods are logging unmasked PANs to a transient in-memory buffer before encryption. This happens during a handshake failure with the NPCI service, creating a brief but unacceptable compliance gap.\n\nThis is not just a technical debt item; it's a direct threat to our Q3 PCI certification and could derail the timelines for Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576. NPCI will not proceed with the final phase of the localization program if we have outstanding critical compliance failures.\n\nHere is the immediate action plan:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Aditya):** A hotfix must be developed to completely remove this logging behavior. The patch needs to ensure that under no circumstances is an unmasked PAN written to any log or buffer, even temporarily. This is being tracked under JIRA PAY-2047. **Deadline: EOD, September 5th.**\n2.  **Security (Priya):** Please prepare the staging environment to validate Aditya's fix. We need your team's formal sign-off confirming the vulnerability is fully remediated before we can deploy to production. **Deadline: Noon, September 6th.**\n3.  **Business Development (Rohit):** I will draft the formal communication to both the auditor and our counterparts at NPCI, outlining our remediation strategy and timeline. I will base this on the technical summary in file#b54760f88f254a8f and the outcome of the hotfix.\n\nI am scheduling an emergency sync for 9:00 AM tomorrow to align on the patch details.

While the overall framework is sound, we've identified two primary areas that require further clarification to meet the stringent requirements of the upcoming RBI Data Localization audit.\n\n**1. Reconciliation Logic & Settlement Latency:**\nThe current T+2 cycle for multi-currency settlements results in a reconciliation discrepancy rate of approximately 0.75%, which we're tracking on our internal Grafana dashboards. The proposed optimization aims for T+1, which is a significant improvement. However, the mechanism for handling FX rate fluctuations between transaction time and settlement batch processing isn't fully defined. This ambiguity is a potential red flag for auditors. To mitigate this, we need a clear field in the settlement file that locks in the FX rate used, along with a corresponding timestamp.\n\n**2. API Authentication and Data Logging:**\nThe proposal for the new `/v2/settlement/foreign_exchange` endpoint mentions an OAuth 2.0 flow but lacks specifics on the grant type and JWT token lifecycle management. For RBI compliance, every API call handling financial data must have an immutable audit log. Our security protocol requires short-lived JWTs (sub-5-minute expiry) with a client credentials grant flow. Can you confirm if your implementation can support this? Any deviation would need to be documented and approved by our CISO. Kibana logs from our current integration show occasional token refresh failures (error code `AUTH_401`), and we want to ensure the new flow is more resilient.\n\nThese concerns are being tracked under JIRA PAY-3453 for Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **NPCI Team:** Please provide an addendum to the specification by Tuesday, June 18th, that details the FX rate locking mechanism and confirms the supported OAuth 2.0 grant type for the new endpoint.\n*   **Priya/Aditya:** Let's schedule a 30-minute technical deep-dive with the NPCI engineering leads for next week to finalize these points before we proceed with staging environment integration.\n\nWe need to ensure these gaps are closed to maintain our project timeline for audit readiness.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiddharth Nair"],"timestamp":1757918100000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["rajesh.kumar@npci.org.in","sunita.verma@npci.org.in"],"cc":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","security.compliance@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"]}},

This seems connected to the transient failures discussed in email 773f7b6406ba4a85.\n\nMore alarmingly, our Kibana log analysis confirms these logs are being replicated to our secondary disaster recovery site, which falls outside the mandated geographic boundaries for storing sensitive payment data as per RBI's directive.

This confirms the initial concerns raised by Aditya in email 18fceaa08f1340fe regarding anomalous data patterns.\n\nThe issue appears to stem from a misconfiguration in the routing rules for our primary UPI gateway. Transactions originating from specific international partner banks are being incorrectly routed to a legacy processing endpoint, which unfortunately does not enforce our current data localization policies. We've observed that for these transactions, sensitive metadata fields (`customer.ip`, `device.fingerprint`) are being logged in our secondary Kibana cluster in `us-east-1` instead of being confined exclusively to the `ap-south-1` (Mumbai) region as mandated by RBI regulations.\n\nHere are the specifics:\n*   **Impact Scope:** Approximately 0.15% of cross-border transaction attempts during the last 6-hour window were affected. This translates to ~1,200 transactions.\n*   **Error Signature:** The affected transactions are not failing; however, they are generating log entries with `data_residency_policy: VIOLATION_LOGGED`.\n*   **Root Cause Analysis:** The preliminary investigation points to a recently updated routing table that lacks the correct geo-fencing flag for newly onboarded international BIN ranges. This is being tracked under JIRA PAY-4911.\n*   **Monitoring:** The 'RBI Compliance' Grafana dashboard shows a clear deviation from our 100% data localization target, which began correlating with the last CI/CD push to the gateway.\n\nThis constitutes a direct and reportable violation for the RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness Program (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576) and puts our compliance attestation with NPCI at risk.\n\n**Action Items:**\n1.  **Engineering (cc: Sandeep):** Please treat JIRA PAY-4911 as a Blocker.

This is a critical blocker for our RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness Program (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576) and requires immediate attention.\n\nBuilding on the analysis from email bfa81acec7104406, our engineering team has pinpointed the issue to the `v2/kyc-automation` endpoint, which is intermittently returning an `HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity` error. The Grafana dashboards show that p99 latency for this API call is spiking to 1.8s, a significant deviation from our 450ms baseline. Kibana logs indicate that the payload validation is failing at the NPCI-side service before data is persisted, which explains the lack of database transaction errors on our end.\n\nThe leading hypothesis, tracked in JIRA PAY-1426, is a regression linked to our recent OAuth 2.0 token refresh logic deployment. It looks like the JWT token is not being correctly propagated through the multi-step verification flow required for these specific customer profiles, causing authentication to drop mid-process. This failure has a direct compliance impact, as it jeopardizes the real-time processing mandate detailed in the audit framework (ref: file#b54760f88f254a8f).\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **Priya (Engineering Lead):** Can your team please prioritize a hotfix?

A legacy configuration file (ref: file#b54760f88f254a8f) was inadvertently pulled during a routine update for a new merchant cohort. This file contained a deprecated routing rule that incorrectly flagged certain domestic UPI transactions (those with specific MCC codes) for potential international processing, bypassing our primary data localization gateway logic.\n\n**Impact Assessment:**\n- **Duration:** The misconfiguration was active for a 22-minute window (09:48 to 10:10 AM IST).\n- **Volume:** Kibana logs show exactly 1,842 transactions were impacted. While the payments were successfully processed via the NPCI switch, their metadata was transiently logged in a non-compliant manner before being reconciled.\n- **Metrics:** Our Grafana dashboard for Compliance Monitoring (RBI-Localization-Dashboard) triggered a P1 alert when the 'Geo-Compliance' metric dropped from 100% to 98.7%. No direct impact on p99 latency (remained stable at ~210ms) or transaction success rates was observed.\n- **Compliance:** This constitutes a Level 2 deviation from the RBI's data localization mandate. The key issue is the audit trail, not end-to-end data storage, which remained within India.\n\n**Corrective Actions (JIRA PAY-1122):**\n1.  **Immediate:** The incorrect config map was rolled back at 10:11 AM IST. We verified via synthetic transaction monitoring that all routing logic reverted to the compliant state by 10:15 AM IST.\n2.  **Permanent:** The CI/CD pipeline is being updated to include a schema validation step that will reject any deployment referencing deprecated configuration files. This will prevent a recurrence.\n3.  **Data Rectification:** We are working with the NPCI team to formally document and purge the transient, non-compliant log entries. We expect this to be completed within the next 48 hours, with a full certificate of destruction provided for our audit records.\n\nWe will compile a final incident report for the upcoming RBI audit readiness review.

This appears to have affected transactions where the merchant MCC was in the 799X range. The Grafana dashboard for our international gateway shows an anomalous traffic spike of ~15 TPS during this window, which correlates with a dip on the primary NPCI gateway.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this means payment data, which must be stored exclusively within India, was processed offshore. This is a direct contravention of the directive under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. We need to quantify the exact number of transactions and confirm that no sensitive cardholder data was logged or stored on the international processor’s systems. The preliminary analysis suggests the OAuth 2.0 flow behaved as expected, but the JWT token was passed to the incorrect API endpoint due to the routing logic failure.\n\nThis incident is being formally tracked under Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576 and JIRA PAY-8115.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **Engineering (Rohan):** Confirm that the hotfix to the routing rules in the Kubernetes pod has been deployed to production and that all traffic is now correctly routed to the domestic NPCI endpoint.

This incorrectly classified a range of international card BINs as domestic, causing them to be routed to the domestic NPCI UPI gateway instead of our designated cross-border processing partner. \n\nConsequently, the NPCI gateway rejected these transactions with error code `U32 - Invalid Transaction Type`. Our Grafana monitoring shows the success rate for international CNP transactions dropped from a baseline of 99.8% to a low of 87.5% between 18:30 IST yesterday and 09:00 IST this morning. This affected approximately 4,500 transactions. The Kibana logs for the `payment-router` pod confirmed that requests for these international BINs were incorrectly directed to the `npci-upi-gw.internal` endpoint, corroborating the initial analysis from Priya in email 06991185dd114d9f.\n\n**Resolution and Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Fix:** The DevOps team successfully rolled back the faulty ConfigMap at 09:15 IST.

We have verified this status through asynchronous polling of the `/checkTxnStatus` endpoint, where we received confirmation codes indicating successful debits. However, these 87 transaction IDs are absent from the final settlement file (`NPCI_SETL_JUSP_20240911.csv`, referenced in file#b54760f88f254a8f) provided by NPCI.\n\nOur Kibana logs for a sample of these transaction IDs show successful `DEBIT_CONFIRMED` events from remitter banks, yet there are no corresponding credit confirmation events visible in the data stream we receive from NPCI. This seems to be the root cause of the mismatch. As you know, complete and accurate reconciliation is a critical control for the RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness Program (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576), and a 0.02% transaction drop-off rate at settlement, while low, is outside our acceptable threshold.\n\nThis issue is tracked internally as JIRA PAY-8416.\n\nAction Items:\n\n1.  **For NPCI:** Could your technical team please investigate the lifecycle of the attached list of 87 transaction IDs? We need to determine if these transactions failed post-confirmation or if there was an error in the settlement report generation process. Please provide the final status of these transactions from your core banking system.\n2.  **For Aditya/Juspay Eng:** Please initiate a parallel review of our reconciliation parser. Let's confirm with 100% certainty that we are not misinterpreting any status flags or experiencing a timing issue on our side, especially considering the points raised in email#68cf918d82794e14 about batch processing windows.\n\nWe have attached a CSV file containing the `transactionId`, `amount`, and `timestamp` for each of the 87 disputed transactions. We need to resolve this by EOD September 13 to ensure our compliance dashboards are accurate for the weekly audit review.\n\nRegards,\n\nSiddharth Nair\nVendor Success Manager | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757921280000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","npci.tech-support@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

To comply with RBI's data storage guidelines, we must add the following fields for every foreign currency transaction: `original_currency`, `final_currency`, `forex_rate_applied`, `forex_provider_id`, and a precise `conversion_timestamp`. Without these, we cannot prove the end-to-end transaction lifecycle remained within India. I have created JIRA PAY-5782 with the full schema requirements.\n\n2.  **Data Residency of Forex Service:** The architecture currently pulls rates via an external API. My primary concern is that while our core systems are localized, this third-party service might process or cache data on servers outside of India. This would be a critical failure point in the audit. We need an immediate verification of the provider's data processing lifecycle and a formal attestation of data residency. The risk analysis in file#b54760f88f254a8f highlights similar third-party vulnerabilities.\n\n3.  **Reconciliation Error Handling:** The proposed T+2 settlement cycle for multi-currency transactions introduces significant FX fluctuation risk, particularly for transactions that fail and require manual reconciliation or reprocessing. The current error handling logic in the settlement system does not account for rate changes between T+0 and T+2, which could lead to reconciliation discrepancies. We may need to explore a dedicated FX float or negotiate a T+1 settlement with NPCI for these flows.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **@Engineering:** Please scope the work for PAY-5782 to update the logging service. We need this deployed to staging by next Friday to begin generating sample data.\n*   **@Infra:** Can you please initiate a formal inquiry with the forex API vendor regarding their data residency and provide a report by EOD Tuesday? If they cannot provide an attestation, we must activate the search for an alternate, compliant provider.\n*   **@Product:** We need to model the financial risk associated with the T+2 FX fluctuations and propose a mitigation strategy.\n\nLet's sync for 30 minutes on Wednesday to review the remediation plan for these points before sharing an updated proposal with NPCI. I will set up the meeting.\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":1757921880000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","rohan.kulkarni@juspay.in","infra-team@juspay.in","product-team@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

The auditors have identified a data residency violation that requires immediate remediation.\n\n**Technical Finding:**\nOur real-time fraud detection engine, 'Sentinel', is inadvertently caching sensitive transaction metadata (specifically MCC and Terminal ID) to a Redis instance hosted in our Singapore region (`redis-sgp-c1.internal.juspay.net`). While the TTL is short (< 3 minutes), this is a direct breach of RBI's circular on Storage of Payment System Data (RBI/2017-18/153).\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nKibana logs filtered for `app:sentinel-cache-writer` and `region:!=in-mumbai-1` confirm the issue. It appears a recent CI/CD update modified the Kubernetes deployment spec for the `sentinel-cache-writer` service. The node affinity rules were relaxed, allowing pods to be scheduled on our non-IN cluster during high-load failover simulations. Over the last 48 hours, this has affected approximately 0.05% of UPI transactions, primarily during the 2-4 PM IST peak when transaction volume exceeds 60K TPS.\n\nThis is being tracked under JIRA PAY-1427. Building on the thread from email e229aea6b4554375, this moves from a potential risk to an active compliance failure.\n\n**Required Actions & Owners:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Containment (Owner: Sameer, DevOps):** Update the Kubernetes deployment manifest for `sentinel-cache-writer` to enforce strict node affinity for the `in-mumbai-1` region only. This change must be deployed to production by 3 PM IST today. Please confirm once the PR is merged.\n\n2.  **Data Purge (Owner: SRE Team):** Execute a full purge of all Juspay-related keys from the `redis-sgp-c1.internal.juspay.net` cluster. We need confirmation with logs showing the FLUSHALL command execution by 4 PM IST.\n\n3.  **Impact Monitoring (Owner: Myself & Analytics):** Post-deployment, we must closely monitor the `Fraud_Model_Performance` Grafana dashboard for any degradation in fraud detection accuracy. I am concerned this might slightly increase p99 latency on the `/v2/tx/process` endpoint, which is currently stable at 180ms. We need to watch this carefully.\n\nWe must treat this with the highest priority. I will be coordinating with the auditors and preparing a formal response memorandum with evidence of remediation for NPCI. Let's sync at 4:30 PM IST to confirm completion of all action items for Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead"],"timestamp":1757922180000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["sameer.g@juspay.in","sre-team@juspay.in","compliance-leads@juspay.in","engineering-leads@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Our Grafana dashboards show that calls to the NPCI `/v2/customer/validate` endpoint for these specific segments are consistently timing out. Kibana logs indicate a recurring `GW-504 Gateway Timeout` error after hitting our 2500ms threshold. In contrast, KYC checks for standard-risk profiles are performing as expected, with a p99 latency of approximately 190ms.\n\nThis is not just a performance issue; it's a significant compliance gap. The inability to complete and log KYC for these segments automatically jeopardizes our ability to demonstrate end-to-end data residency as mandated by the RBI guidelines, a key point in the audit criteria outlined in file#b54760f88f254a8f. The full technical breakdown and impact analysis have been attached to JIRA PAY-1944.\n\nOur current hypothesis is that the transaction payloads for these high-risk segments, which may contain additional data points for our internal fraud detection models, are being routed through a different, slower validation path within the NPCI infrastructure. The API specification we aligned on (ref: email#68cf918d82794e14) did not specify any differential processing. Could you please confirm if this is the case or if there are stricter, unpublished rate limits being applied to these profiles on your end?\n\nTo resolve this urgently, we require the following actions:\n\n1.  **NPCI Team:** Please investigate the logs on your side for requests from our production IP block (103.45.12.XX) that are resulting in `GW-504` errors. We can provide a list of `trace-id`s upon request.\n2.  **Priya/Juspay Eng:** Please have the list of relevant `trace-id`s from the last 6 hours ready to share.\n3.  **All:** We need to convene an urgent technical sync tomorrow, 11 AM IST, to go over NPCI's findings and define a remediation path.

This is a direct result of synchronously writing detailed payload data for every transaction as per the preliminary audit checklist. The current state is unsustainable and poses a risk to our overall transaction success rate, especially during peak load. This meeting is to finalize a technical strategy that satisfies compliance without compromising system performance.\n\nWe need to make a decision on the path forward. Engineering has proposed two main options in the PAY-3280 ticket, and we need to align on one. Option A involves a move to asynchronous logging for non-critical data points, using a Kafka stream to offload the I/O. Option B suggests creating dynamic logging levels tied to the initial risk score of a transaction, where only high-risk transactions get the full verbose, synchronous log. Both have implications for data retrieval during an audit.\n\nAgenda:\n1.  Quick review of the latency impact (Sanjay to present Grafana dashboard snapshot).\n2.

The daily reconciliation reports from the last two weeks are showing a consistent 0.02% mismatch between our Euler ledger and the final settlement files from NPCI. While the financial value is currently low, this is a significant control gap that will be scrutinized during the upcoming RBI Data Localization audit. We need to get ahead of this now.\n\nVikram's preliminary analysis in BigQuery (see attached query link in Confluence) suggests the issue is tied to late-night transaction finalizations, specifically for transactions that cross the T+1 cutoff window. It appears our reconciliation service (`upi-reco-engine-v3`) may be incorrectly flagging these specific cases. The Grafana dashboard for the service shows a recurring `unreconciled_txn_count` spike around 1:30 AM IST, which correlates with the batch processing time. We need to confirm this hypothesis and determine the exact failure point in the logic.\n\nLet's use this meeting to achieve three clear objectives:\n1.  **Confirm Root Cause:** Rajesh, can you walk us through the current state-handling logic for late authorizations in the reconciliation script? Let's pinpoint where the `transaction_status` update is failing.\n2.  **Assess Impact:** Vikram, please prepare a 90-day look-back on the total mismatched volume and value. Ananya, let's discuss any potential impact on merchant settlement reports or user-facing transaction histories.\n3.  **Define Fix & Timeline:** We need to decide on a patch. A hotfix to the state machine seems most pragmatic given the audit deadline in three weeks. We must agree on an owner and an ETA for the code change, testing, and deployment.\n\nMy goal is to finalize a remediation plan in this meeting that can be documented for the auditors.

This is a direct violation of RBI's data localization mandate. We need to define and commit to a remediation plan by EOD tomorrow to satisfy the auditors.\n\nInitial investigation from DevOps points to a misconfiguration in the Kafka Connect S3 sink connector, where the `storage.class` and region settings are not correctly inheriting the data residency policies defined in our IAM roles. The connector seems to be defaulting to a global replication policy. The goal of this call is to agree on an immediate containment strategy and a permanent fix.\n\nAgenda & Proposed Actions:\n1.  **Immediate Containment:** Rajesh, can we implement an explicit S3 bucket policy to deny writes from the Kafka Connect IAM role to any bucket outside `ap-south-1`? This should be our firewall. Proposing we deploy this within 2 hours post-meeting.\n2.  **Permanent Fix:** Anjali, we need to trace why the residency flag from the original event in the HyperSDK is not being propagated to the logging metadata. Is there a serialization issue? Let's scope the fix and create a sub-task under PAY-2419.\n3.  **Validation:** Once the fix is deployed to staging, we need a clear validation plan. This should involve generating test transactions and verifying in CloudTrail logs that no `PutObject` calls are made to ex-India buckets.\nWe must finalize owners and ETAs for all these actions on this call.

The root cause was identified as an inefficient query pattern within a recently deployed module, which triggered multiple sequential database lookups per scoring request instead of a single batched operation. The connection pool, configured with `scylla.db.connection.pool.max_size=250`, was insufficient to handle the amplified load during the peak transaction window.","Immediate remediation involved an emergency configuration push to increase the `max_size` parameter to 400, which stabilized latency within acceptable bounds. The permanent fix, tracked via JIRA ticket PAY-2988, requires the engineering team to refactor the feature generation logic to utilize a batch query pattern, thereby reducing the number of database round-trips. As a compliance action item, this Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and the corresponding remediation plan will be formally submitted to the architecture review board and attached to the 'RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness Program' Confluence page as proof of proactive risk mitigation and system optimization."],"owner":"Priya Nair","ownerEmail":"priya.nair@juspay.in","photoLink":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/photo5","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.nair@juspay.in","tech-leads@juspay.in","product-team@juspay.in","compliance@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"application/json","createdAt":1757993400000,"updatedAt":1757993400000}},

Specifically, our `NostroReconciliation` service makes calls that transmit `juspay_txn_id` and `merchant_ref_id` to obtain FX conversion rates, which are subsequently logged by the external vendor. This project (PAY-6413) mandates the complete replacement of this external dependency with an internal, India-hosted solution to ensure all payment system data is stored exclusively within our domestic infrastructure.","We will deploy a new microservice, `FX-Local-Proxy`, within our Kubernetes cluster in the Mumbai (ap-south-1) AWS region. This service will function as an intelligent pass-through cache, pre-fetching hourly FX rates from our licensed banking partners (HDFC, ICICI) via their secured treasury APIs and storing them in an in-memory Redis instance (cluster: `settlement-cache-prod-mumbai`). The `NostroReconciliation` service will be reconfigured to query `FX-Local-Proxy` using only `currency_pair` and `timestamp_bucket`, fully decoupling it from any transaction-specific data. We will monitor cache-hit ratios via Grafana dashboard (ID: `settlement-fx-perf`), targeting a >99.8% hit rate. A cache miss will trigger a direct, non-logged API call to the partner bank, with a new critical alert `FX_CACHE_MISS_HIGH_FREQ` if the rate exceeds 5 per minute.","The immediate action item is for the Settlements-Core engineering team to finalize the containerization of the `FX-Local-Proxy` application (scaffold in Git repo `juspay/fx-local-proxy`) and deploy it to the staging environment. Following deployment, the Risk & Operations team will initiate A/B testing by routing 15% of our USD settlement volume through the new service for a 72-hour period. We will compare final settlement values against the legacy flow using Presto queries on the `settlements_log_v3` table. Any discrepancy exceeding 0.01% will trigger a `SETTLEMENT_RECON_DELTA_FAIL` error and halt the rollout.

This issue presents a material risk to our readiness for the upcoming RBI Data Localization Audit and requires our immediate attention.\n\nBuilding on the initial analysis from file bc6ce4fb00f44023, our deep dive into the Kibana logs indicates the root cause is likely within our `kyc-risk-profiler` service. We're observing consistent timeout errors (HTTP 504) for requests to the `/v2/profile/evaluate` endpoint when processing users with a risk score greater than 0.8. The p99 latency for these specific API calls is spiking to over 4500ms, far exceeding the downstream service's 2000ms timeout threshold. This is causing the entire workflow to fail and fall back to a manual verification queue, which is not sustainable and creates an audit trail gap.\n\nThe Grafana dashboard for payment services confirms a direct correlation between this latency spike and the growing backlog in the manual KYC processing queue, which now stands at over 1,500 pending cases. This is not just an operational strain; it's a compliance failure in the context of our work for ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576, as it breaks the end-to-end automated processing record required by the RBI.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Siddharth (Dev Lead):** Can your team please prioritize investigating the performance bottleneck in the `kyc-risk-profiler`? The issue seems to be query-related when fetching historical data for these high-risk profiles. Please evaluate if a hotfix or an optimized DB index can be deployed by EOD tomorrow.

Further to the initial findings in email 671b1d91bcd349a3, our analysis confirms a discrepancy that requires immediate attention from both Juspay and NPCI teams.\n\nHere are the specifics:\n\n• **Impact Scope:** Our settlement system has flagged a shortfall of ₹5,17,581 across a batch of 1,245 UPI transactions processed between 14:00 and 16:30 IST yesterday.\n• **Technical Root Cause:** The issue appears to originate from delayed responses from NPCI's `/api/v2/payment/status` endpoint. Our gateway logs (export attached as file#bc6ce4fb00f44023) show a series of connection timeouts, even though the transactions were eventually successful at the banking end. This resulted in our system marking them with an interim `PENDING` status, which failed to update before the T+1 settlement cut-off.\n• **Performance Metrics:** The Grafana dashboard shows p99 latency for this endpoint spiking to 1,950ms during the incident window, a significant deviation from the sub-500ms baseline. Our overall system uptime remained 99.98%, which is why this state-mismatch was not caught by high-level alerts.\n\nThis isn't merely a financial variance; it's a data integrity issue that auditors will scrutinize. Proving that our stored transaction data is a perfect, verifiable mirror of the NPCI ledger is a core tenet of the localization mandate.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **[Aditya/Engineering]:** Please execute the manual reconciliation script for the affected batch (JIRA PAY-7624) and confirm financial closure by 6 PM today. We need to ensure our ledgers are accurate.\n2.  **[NPCI Team]:** Can you please investigate the root cause of the latency spike on your status API endpoint from your end?

Our Grafana metrics show a sustained burst of `HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)` errors originating from their `/upi/transaction/v2/initiate` endpoint since approximately 11:30 AM IST.\n\nThis is artificially capping our transaction processing at ~8,200 TPS, a significant deviation from our expected peak capacity of 15,000 TPS. The direct result is a 12% drop in successful transaction volume during peak hours, and we're seeing a corresponding increase in p99 latency to 1.8s for the affected flow.\n\nThis throttling places the RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness program (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576) at significant risk. It directly undermines our ability to demonstrate the system scalability and resilience under load stipulated in the audit framework (ref: file#bc6ce4fb00f44023), which we discussed in the last review.\n\nI have already raised a SEV-1 ticket with our technical account manager at NPCI, explicitly referencing the 20,000 TPS threshold defined in our MSA.

A key example is transaction `JPTXN_upi_abcdef123456`, where our system recorded a 'Success' status, but it appears to be missing from the final NPCI settlement file we received at 04:00 IST.\n\nInitial analysis of Kibana logs for our `ReconEngine` service suggests this isn't a simple processing failure. It seems the engine successfully ingested the file, but the logic failed to map certain transactions. My primary concern is that this could be related to delayed `TXN_COMPLETED` status responses from the UPI gateway during the peak volume window yesterday between 18:00 and 19:30 IST.

This poses a significant risk to our RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness program with NPCI. \n\nOur Grafana risk dashboard is showing a sustained 12% failure rate for users flagged by our fraud detection model as 'high-risk'. This issue, tracked in JIRA PAY-5769, seems to originate from our internal KYC service when processing these specific user profiles, building on the initial analysis from Aditya in email 9d673f4f600f41d3.\n\nTechnical Details:\nKibana logs from the `kyc-automation-service` pods show a recurring `422 Unprocessable Entity` response during the `POST /v2/kyc/verify` call to our internal service, which then proxies the request to the NPCI gateway. The internal error code is consistently `KYC_VALIDATION_MISMATCH`. \n\nMy primary hypothesis is that a data mapping issue is causing this. The payload for high-risk profiles contains an 'additional_risk_factors' object which, it appears, is not being correctly serialized or is failing NPCI's stricter validation schema for this user tier. This is a critical compliance gap, as failed transaction data (including PII) is being logged with full payloads in our exception queues. These queues are not yet fully configured for the localized data storage requirements specified in file#bc6ce4fb00f44023.\n\nImpact:\nBeyond the operational bottleneck of manual reviews, this failure represents a material finding for the upcoming RBI audit.

This is a 4.7x increase and well outside our operational tolerance.\n*   **System Throughput:** The system is currently capping out at approximately 480 TPS, failing to meet the required 600 TPS target specified in the project scope (ref: email#671b1d91bcd349a3). This performance drop is causing transaction queues to build up during peak hours.\n*   **Error Analysis:** Kibana logs indicate a sharp rise in `503 Service Unavailable` errors originating from the Kubernetes pods handling synchronous writes to the on-premise Oracle DB cluster. It seems the database connection pool is exhausting, leading to request throttling.\n*   **Compliance Impact:** From a compliance standpoint, this processing delay could be interpreted by auditors as a failure to meet the spirit of the data localization mandate, which implies timely processing within India's borders, not just eventual storage.

This translates to an estimated 15,000 legitimate transactions being incorrectly blocked per hour during peak load (11 AM - 2 PM IST).\n*   **System Impact:** Our Grafana dashboard (Risk-Ops-Primary) shows a direct correlation between the model deployment and a spike in transactions failing with the internal error code `RISK_DECLINE_7B`. Kibana queries on the `sentry-fraud-engine` logs indicate that rule `FR-74B` (transaction velocity/frequency check) is the primary trigger.\n*   **Root Cause Analysis:** It seems the new model's feature weighting for merchant category codes (MCCs) in the 8000-8999 range (service providers) is overly aggressive, especially for amounts below ₹1000.

Here are the findings:\n\n1.  **Transaction Confirmation:** All 87 affected transactions received a `SUCCESS` confirmation from NPCI's primary payment processing endpoint between 14:30 and 14:45 IST. Our gateway logs show standard 200 OK responses with valid NPCI transaction IDs.\n\n2.  **System Performance:** Our Grafana monitoring shows no anomalous behavior on our side. UPI gateway latency (p99) remained under 250ms, and our transaction processing service maintained a 99.98% success rate.

The transactions are definitively absent. Our parsing script reported no errors, indicating the file format itself is valid.\n\nOur working hypothesis is that there might be a data synchronization issue between NPCI's real-time transaction processing layer and the batch system that generates the end-of-day settlement files.

This is a critical concern for the ongoing RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness Program (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576), and we need to address it with high priority.\n\nBuilding on Aditya's initial analysis in email c472751069874d94, our engineering team has isolated the root cause. Here are the specifics:\n\n*   **Symptom:** We are observing p99 latency for payment initiation API calls spiking from our baseline of ~180ms to over 2100ms. This directly correlates with an error rate increase to 4.5% on transactions routed through the NPCI gateway.\n*   **Root Cause:** Our Kibana logs show a surge in `401 Unauthorized` responses from the NPCI gateway. The issue stems from our token management service's interaction with your `/token` endpoint. While initial token generation is successful, the subsequent calls using the `refresh_token` grant type are intermittently failing without a clear error code. This forces our service to use expired JWTs, resulting in the `401`s and subsequent timeouts as our system retries.\n*   **Monitoring Data:** The Grafana dashboard 'NPCI-UPI-Gateway-Performance' clearly shows this pattern, starting around 14:30 IST yesterday.

This is the root cause of the API timeouts we've been tracking under Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576.\n\n**Technical Findings:**\n\nThe issue appears localized within our `oauth-client` service, which is failing to proactively refresh JWT tokens before their expiry. Our calls to NPCI's UPI gateway are subsequently being rejected with `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` errors. The Grafana dashboard 'NPCI-Gateway-Performance' shows a 4.5% error rate during peak load (approx. 11 AM IST), with p99 latency spiking to 1.8s as our retry logic seems to be creating connection pool contention, eventually resulting in `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeouts`.\n\nKibana queries against our production Kubernetes cluster logs (`kubernetes.pod.name:\"upi-gateway-*\" AND message:\"Invalid token\"`) correlate directly with the 401 error spikes. This isn't a performance issue on NPCI's end; it's an internal authentication lifecycle management failure.\n\n**Compliance Impact (RBI Data Localization):**\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, this presents two significant risks for the upcoming RBI audit:\n1.  **System Availability & Integrity:** The transaction failures and service degradation directly contradict our stated 99.95% uptime SLA. This could be flagged as a critical failure in operational resilience.\n2.  **Audit Trail Completeness:** More critically, we must ensure that all logs pertaining to these authentication failures are being correctly captured and stored exclusively within our India-based data centers. Any misconfiguration in the logging pipeline that leaks these failure logs, even for debugging, would constitute a direct breach of the data localization mandate. I am initiating a separate check on the Fluentd configuration for these specific pods.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Anjali (Engineering):** Please prioritize the investigation in JIRA PAY-9661. The goal is a hotfix for the token refresh logic to be deployed to the staging environment by EOD tomorrow for validation.\n*   **Priya (Self):** I will draft a formal risk memo outlining these findings against the control requirements in file#bc6ce4fb00f44023 and attach it to the JIRA ticket by 6 PM today.\n*   **DevOps Team:** Can we review the alert sensitivity for 4xx-series errors originating from the UPI gateway?

The rule intended to direct all non-INR transactions from foreign-issued instruments (BIN ranges specified in file#bc6ce4fb00f44023) to our international processing partner was incorrectly applied. Instead, it routed a subset of these transactions through the domestic NPCI network.\n\nThis had two primary impacts:\n\n1.  **Processing Failures:** Approximately 4,500 transactions between 2:00 AM and 4:30 AM IST were incorrectly processed. Our Grafana dashboard `UPI-CrossBorder-Health` shows a spike in error rate to 1.2% for the `/v2/upi/process-payment` API, with a majority failing with error code `NPCI-51` (Insufficient Funds) as the domestic rails couldn't handle the forex component. p99 latency for this cohort also increased to 1,850ms against a 450ms baseline.\n\n2.  **Data Residency Breach:** More seriously, for the transactions that were processed, sensitive payment instrument data was temporarily stored in our domestic Kubernetes cluster's caching layer. Kibana logs confirm this data persistence. This constitutes a direct breach of our data localization architecture and is a critical finding we must self-report for the upcoming RBI audit.\n\nThe SRE team rolled back the faulty configuration at 4:45 AM IST, and transaction processing has returned to normal. Error rates are now back at a nominal 0.05%.\n\nImmediate actions are required:\n\n*   **Priya (Data Engineering):** Please prioritize the data purge from the affected domestic cache instances as tracked in JIRA PAY-4622.

This is our most critical step for remediation.\n\n*   **Rohan (DevOps):** We need a formal RCA on how this configuration passed QA and pre-prod checks. Please investigate the CI/CD pipeline and automated testing gaps that allowed this deployment. A preventative action plan is required by Friday, 12-Oct.\n\nI will handle the formal communication with our NPCI contacts, outlining the incident, our immediate resolution, and the data remediation plan.

A full list of the affected `juspay_txn_id`s and corresponding `npci_txn_id`s is attached in the updated analysis sheet (ref: file#bc6ce4fb00f44023).\n\nInitial investigation from the engineering team suggests our transaction processing via the UPI gateway was nominal. Kibana logs confirm all 112 transactions received a successful (`00`) response from NPCI's `/p2m/transact` endpoint, with p95 latencies holding steady at ~180ms. The 'UPI-Settlement-Monitoring' Grafana dashboard shows no corresponding error spikes or API gateway timeouts during the settlement window. This indicates the discrepancy likely originated post-transaction authorization, possibly during NPCI's batch aggregation process.\n\nThis issue poses a direct risk to our RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness program (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576), as end-to-end data integrity and verifiable reconciliation are critical audit controls.

This directly impacts our reporting for the RBI Data Localization audit (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576) and requires immediate investigation.\n\nOur internal reconciliation service, `ReconEngine-v2`, has reported a mismatch of INR 1,72,45,110 across 4,819 transactions against the consolidated settlement file received from NPCI. The core issue, as detailed in JIRA PAY-7792, seems to be a state divergence. Our `payments_db` has these transactions marked as `STATUS_SUCCESS` following what appeared to be a successful 200 OK response from the UPI gateway, but they are listed as `STATUS_FAILED` or not present at all in the NPCI report.\n\nBuilding on the initial analysis from email 9319a7310df845ff, the engineering team has been pulling Kibana logs for a sample of the affected `txnId`s. Early findings suggest we might be facing an issue with asynchronous callbacks. It looks like our system processes the initial synchronous response from the `/payments/v2/charge` endpoint successfully, but the final asynchronous `S2S` callback from NPCI, which provides the terminal status (`SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`), is either delayed beyond our 60s timeout window or is failing silently. This would explain why our system assumes success while NPCI has a different final state.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, this is a critical gap. As per RBI's directive on Storage of Payment System Data (RBI/2017-18/153), we must ensure end-to-end transaction data integrity and prove that the final, settled state of every transaction is accurately stored within our India-based infrastructure. A recurring mismatch of this scale will be a major red flag for the auditors.\n\nAction Items:\n\n1.  **Aditya:** Please prioritize the full log analysis for all 4,819 transaction IDs. We need to confirm the S2S callback failure pattern and check for any specific error codes or network timeouts on our ingress controllers. I need a summary report by EOD tomorrow.\n2.  **Rohan (Finance):** Can your team please initiate the manual override process for these transactions to provisionally credit the affected merchant accounts? We need to contain the financial exposure and prevent partner escalations. Please confirm once the ledger adjustments are underway.\n3.  **Myself:** I will collate the transaction data, our internal logs, and the corresponding NPCI settlement file (ref: file#bc6ce4fb00f44023) into a formal incident report. This will serve as our evidence trail for the audit.\n\nNext step is to schedule an urgent technical sync with our NPCI contact, Mr. Sharma, for Thursday.

We need to confirm if this is happening in production or isolated to the staging environment where the audit scan was run. Rohan, I need you to trace the code path responsible for generating these log payloads.

The current rate is holding at 8.2% for NPCI-routed transactions, significantly above our 2.5% target. This session is to finalize and commit to a concrete mitigation plan based on the analysis from Ravi's team.\n\nKey findings presented by Sandeep confirmed our suspicions: the spike is correlated with a feature drift in transaction patterns from Tier-3 cities post the recent holiday season, which our current model `Fraud-Engine-v2.1` wasn't sufficiently trained to handle. The Kibana dashboard snapshot attached to the invite confirms the issue began after deployment ID `dep-77a4b2`. Aditya also verified no underlying infra changes on the payment-gateway or IAM services align with this timeline, isolating the problem to the model's logic, specifically rule set `FDE-NPCI-UPI-45b` which appears too aggressive for low-value, high-frequency UPI transfers.\n\nBased on the discussion, we've decided on a two-pronged approach. First, we will immediately introduce and enable a new feature flag, `disable-low-value-aggro-rules`, to selectively bypass this aggressive rule set for all UPI transactions under ₹500. This should provide immediate relief. Second, the ML team will initiate a priority retraining cycle for the model using an augmented dataset that includes the last 30 days of transaction data from the affected regions. This will address the root cause.\n\nAction Items:\n- **Aditya Singh:** Create and deploy the `disable-low-value-aggro-rules` feature flag across all production instances.

These events correlate directly with a degradation in our payment processing service's p99 latency, which increased from 350ms to over 800ms during peak hours (19:00-21:00 IST) last week. The current static retry logic in our 'HyperSwitch' routing engine, configured with a `max_retries` of 3 and a fixed `base_delay` of 200ms, is exacerbating the issue by creating a thundering herd problem against the vendor gateway, leading to a cascading failure state that impacts our ability to meet the 679 TPS target outlined in the RBI audit readiness plan.","The immediate compliance risk is operational; sustained transaction failures due to rate limiting could be flagged as a systemic instability during the audit, even though it doesn't directly pertain to data localization. Our Grafana dashboards (ref: grafana.juspay.in/d/def456) confirm that the error rate spikes are not isolated but affect the entire VPA pool routed through our primary Mumbai-based data center's egress IPs. The failure of these transactions prevents corresponding payment data from being stored locally in our ScyllaDB cluster, creating gaps in the audit trail that must be manually reconciled, a process which is not scalable.","As a remediation strategy tracked under JIRA PAY-2425, the SRE team must implement a client-side adaptive rate limiter using a token bucket algorithm within the HyperSwitch service mesh. The bucket's refill rate should be dynamically adjusted based on the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers returned by the NPCI API. If these headers are not consistently provided, the fallback will be a circuit breaker pattern configured to trip for 60 seconds after encountering 50 consecutive 429 responses within a 1-minute sliding window.

Log aggregation via Fluentd shows a high incidence of ERR_SCORING_TIMEOUT responses from the service, impacting approximately 2.8% of transactions routed through the NPCI gateway. This breach of our 100ms internal SLA poses a direct risk to the successful completion of the upcoming RBI data localization audit, as all scoring logic must execute within our ap-south-1 (Mumbai) data boundary without causing transaction drops.","Initial root cause analysis points to a read contention issue within our Mumbai region's ScyllaDB cluster, which stores user transaction history vectors. The latency degradation correlates with the recent deployment of a new feature vector, `payer_velocity_hist_14d`, which involves a more complex read-modify-write operation on wide rows. Jaeger traces confirm that the `getUserProfileForScoring` function is the primary bottleneck, with p99 duration for this specific call exceeding 250ms. The Kubernetes pods for the RiskGuard service are operating at 95% CPU utilization, suggesting the current resource allocation is insufficient for the new computational load introduced by the vector calculation.","Immediate action requires a temporary rollback of the `payer_velocity_hist_14d` feature via the HyperSwitch feature flag `enable-v2-velocity-checks`. Concurrently, the SRE team must profile the ScyllaDB query performance under load and evaluate an increase in the read-repair chance from 0.1 to 0.3 to improve data consistency without impacting read latency severely. A long-term fix involves refactoring the feature vector computation to use a pre-aggregated data model stored in a dedicated Redis cache, which will be updated asynchronously via a Flink streaming job.

While targeting 500 TPS against NPCI's `npcicbs/v2/payment/initiate` endpoint, we are observing p99 latencies spiking to over 2.1s. This is a significant deviation from our baseline of 350ms under similar loads with the legacy system. The error rate is climbing to an unacceptable 4.5%, predominantly `504 Gateway Timeouts`, which I've tracked in our Kibana logs.\n\nThe Grafana dashboard for this test run clearly correlates the latency spike with transaction volume once we cross the ~280 TPS mark. Our Kubernetes pod auto-scaling is functioning as expected, which suggests the issue is likely not with our core infrastructure but rather in the integration layer's connection handling with NPCI or within the new CBS itself.

This is a significant regression from the pre-migration baseline of ~300ms.\n*   **Error Rate:** We are seeing a sustained error rate of 3.5% with `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` responses from your end. This begins to manifest once our transaction volume surpasses 12,000 TPS, which is well below the target capacity.\n*   **System Health:** Our Grafana dashboards confirm that Juspay's Kubernetes pods are scaling correctly, and our Redis caching layers show no signs of abnormal pressure. The JWT token generation and OAuth 2.0 authentication flows are also operating within expected latency thresholds (<20ms).\n*   **Log Analysis:** Analysis of Kibana logs confirms our systems are successfully dispatching requests. The delay is occurring between the request leaving our gateway and receiving an acknowledgment from the NPCI ingress.

This creates a critical break in our transaction lifecycle audit trail, which is a key focus for the upcoming RBI audit under Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576.\n\nKibana logs for our UPI gateway Kubernetes pods show a p99 latency spike to 1.8s for responses from NPCI during that window, well above our 450ms internal threshold. This might be related to the NPCI-side configuration changes mentioned in email#ae04d7100af8449d.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **Engineering (Aditya/Vikram):** Please prioritize the investigation documented in JIRA PAY-2666. We need an RCA on why our timeout handling logic did not trigger a reversal or move these to a pending state instead of a hard success. Can we review the state machine configuration for the gateway?\n2.  **Finance Ops (Sunita):** Please initiate the process to move the mismatched ₹4.72L into a temporary suspense account. Do not proceed with settling these funds to the merchants until we have resolution.\n3.  **Compliance (Myself):** I am drafting a formal query to NPCI to request their server-side logs for the 312 transaction IDs and to understand the root cause of the callback failures. I am also updating the project's risk register with this incident.\n\nWe need to have this resolved swiftly. Let's sync at 3:30 PM today to review engineering's initial findings before I send the official communication to NPCI.\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya Nair"],"timestamp":1757913660000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","vikram.mehta@juspay.in","sunita.rao@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"]}},

These issues require immediate remediation to meet compliance deadlines.\n\nKey Findings:\n\n1.  **Data Residency for Forex Transactions:** Our Forex API gateway logs, which include transaction identifiers and FX rate timestamps, are currently being processed and stored in our AWS `us-east-1` Kubernetes cluster. This is a direct violation of RBI's data localization mandate. The data must reside entirely within our `ap-south-1` (Mumbai) infrastructure. This affects all cross-border transactions processed via our platform.\n\n2.  **Settlement Latency & Reconciliation Mismatches:** We are consistently failing to meet T+1 settlement for major currency pairs like USD-INR and EUR-INR, currently operating at a T+2 cycle. The primary bottleneck appears to be our settlement engine's batch reconciliation job, which shows a p99 latency of over 4 hours when matching against NPCI's confirmation files. Furthermore, settlements involving SGD and AED are experiencing a 1.8% failure rate, generating error code `SETL-504 (FX_RATE_EXPIRED)` in our Grafana dashboard. This is significantly above our 0.2% operational tolerance.\n\n3.  **Data Integrity in Settlement Files:** The SHA-256 checksum validation for settlement files from partner banks is failing intermittently during peak load (approx. 15,000 TPS). Kibana logs indicate that our ingestion service is falling back to an MD5 hash verification as a contingency, which is not compliant with the security protocols outlined in the technical specification doc `file#458da17f4292453c` and poses a significant data integrity risk.\n\nThese findings are now consolidated under JIRA ticket PAY-3943 for tracking and resolution.\n\nAction Items:\n\n*   **Engineering (cc: Aditya):** Please provide a detailed project plan and effort estimate for migrating the Forex API gateway's logging and processing pipeline to the `ap-south-1` region. **Deadline: EOD, Friday.**\n*   **Operations Team:** Initiate a manual reconciliation of all failed SGD/AED transactions from the past 72 hours. Document the root cause for each failure and report back. **Deadline: COB, Thursday.**\n*   **Anjali Patel (Self):** I will escalate the confirmation file delay with our NPCI counterparts, referencing the concerns raised in `email#ae04d7100af8449d`, to explore optimizations in their file generation process.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nA remediation plan addressing these points must be presented to the audit committee by next Wednesday.

Our Grafana monitoring (Dashboard: 'UPI Transaction Health') shows that p99 latency for calls to the `/v2/risk/evaluate` endpoint began increasing sharply around 14:30 IST yesterday, moving from a stable baseline of ~120ms to sustained peaks over 850ms. \n\nThis is unfortunately causing downstream timeouts in our primary UPI payment processor. We're seeing a corresponding rise in transaction failure rates from our standard 0.15% to 0.48%, with the majority logging a `T504: Gateway Timeout` error. Our internal investigation, tracked under JIRA PAY-1372, has reviewed our Kubernetes pod health, egress traffic, and the OAuth 2.0 JWT generation flow; we have not found any anomalies on our side. The request payload and authentication tokens appear to be constructed correctly, but the response time from the NPCI gateway is the source of the delay.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this level of performance unpredictability is a serious concern for the upcoming RBI audit. We must be able to demonstrate system stability and adherence to processing SLAs. \n\nCould your technical team please investigate on priority? We suspect there might have been a recent deployment or a configuration change on your end that aligns with this timeline.

The issue stemmed from a routing configuration error that directly impacts our RBI Data Localization audit readiness (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576).\n\n**Technical Details & Impact:**\n\nA new rule deployed via our CI/CD pipeline at 14:15 IST yesterday, intended to optimize routing for domestic QR payments, was incorrectly applied to a range of international VPA prefixes. This caused our UPI gateway to misdirect approximately 1,500 transactions from international acquiring banks to our primary India-based processing cluster instead of the designated, isolated overseas corridor.\n\n*   **Impact Window:** 14:30 - 16:00 IST, 2nd July.\n*   **Error Signature:** Grafana dashboards show a surge in `U69 - Transaction not permitted` responses from the NPCI interface, peaking at a 3.2% error rate for the affected cohort.\n*   **Compliance Breach:** Kibana logs confirm that transaction payloads containing PII for these failed payments were ingested and temporarily stored in our India-based Elasticsearch indices, which is a clear deviation from RBI's data localization mandate.\n*   **JIRA Ticket:** All technical investigation and remediation efforts are tracked under JIRA PAY-3693.\n\n**Immediate Actions Taken:**\n\n1.  An emergency hotfix was deployed at 16:05 IST, reverting the faulty routing rule. Transaction success rates returned to the baseline of 99.8% by 16:10 IST.\n2.  I’ve updated the analysis in `file#458da17f4292453c` with the specific log queries used for identification.\n\n**Required Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Data Purge (Urgent):** We must initiate a script to locate and purge all logs and transient data related to the affected transaction IDs from our domestic Kafka topics and logging clusters by EOD tomorrow. Priya, can your team own this and confirm once completed?\n2.  **Preventative Controls:** We need to enhance the pre-deployment validation logic. I propose adding a mandatory check that cross-references routing rule changes against a master list of international BINs and VPA patterns to prevent a recurrence. This is a crucial control for our upcoming audit.\n3.  **Incident Report:** We need to document this incident for our compliance records, detailing the cause, impact, and remediation steps.

Our UPI gateway logs, cross-verified in Kibana, show successful (`00`) response codes from NPCI for all 87 transactions. However, these transaction references are completely missing from the final settlement file we received at 04:15 AM IST.\n\nThis is not a simple processing error on our end; it points to a potential data integrity issue between NPCI's real-time transaction processing and their batch settlement generation system. An unresolved discrepancy of this nature would be a critical finding in our System Audit Report (SAR), violating the principles of data accuracy mandated by RBI/2017-18/153.\n\nThe related Grafana dashboard 'UPI-Settlement-Monitoring' confirms our systems processed the transactions correctly, with p99 latency well within our 250ms SLA for the period in question.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **Engineering (cc'd):** Please retrieve the full request/response payloads from our production logs for the transaction IDs listed in JIRA PAY-1080.

Following up on the initial alert from email 4a6e289a0f1643f1, the issue has escalated and is preventing us from completing the pre-audit data flow validation for the RBI Data Localization program (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576).\n\nOur UPI-Gateway-Staging Grafana dashboard shows the error rate for the NPCI transaction status inquiry endpoint (/v2/transaction/status) has spiked to ~18% over the last four hours. P99 latency is holding above 2.1s, far exceeding our 250ms baseline. This directly correlates with the OAuth token refresh failures we're seeing.\n\nDiving into the Kibana logs, our service consistently receives HTTP 401 Unauthorized responses when attempting to refresh the JWT access token. It looks like the refresh token is being invalidated by the NPCI auth server before its expected expiry. This is not happening on every cycle, which suggests a potential rate-limiting or configuration mismatch rather than a hard credential failure. The behavior started around 9:30 AM IST today, with no corresponding deployment on our side.\n\nThis completely halts our ability to verify end-to-end transaction data integrity and logging within Indian data centers, a core requirement for the upcoming audit. We cannot proceed with the compliance checklist until this is resolved.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **Engineering (Aditya):** Please prioritize JIRA PAY-1653. We need a full diagnostic of the OAuth 2.0 token exchange flow. Can you confirm our client_id and secret against the configuration provided by NPCI in file#458da17f4292453c and trace the request headers to see if the refresh token is being malformed?\n2.  **Risk & Ops (Anjali):** I will prepare a formal escalation to our technical contacts at NPCI, but I need your team's initial findings to provide concrete evidence.

While the proposal is a good starting point, we have identified several critical areas that require clarification to ensure compliance with the RBI Data Localization mandate for work c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576.\n\nOur primary concern is data residency. The current architecture appears to introduce an external dependency for Forex rate fetching. Can you confirm and provide documentation that all transaction data, including the applied FX rates and associated timestamps, will be processed and stored exclusively within data centers located in India? For the audit, we must demonstrate that no part of the payment processing data traverses outside the country, even temporarily.\n\nSecondly, the performance impact on our T+1 settlement cycle is unclear. Our current INR settlement reconciliation engine processes batches of ~750k transactions in under 60 minutes. Introducing two new API calls per transaction for FX conversion before settlement could significantly increase this time. Our initial model, based on the specs, estimates a potential increase in processing time to over 3 hours, which would breach our internal SLAs. To refine this, we need the following metrics for your proposed FX rate API:\n\n•   Expected p95 and p99 latency at a load of 10K TPS.\n•   Guaranteed throughput and rate-limiting policies.\n\nFinally, the API integration details in the spec are incomplete. For the new settlement endpoints, our engineering team (Priya is leading this on JIRA PAY-3978) requires clarification on the OAuth 2.0 flow. Specifically, we need to understand the JWT token expiry duration, the token refresh mechanism, and a comprehensive list of error codes for failed FX lookups or settlement submissions. This is essential for building a resilient integration that meets our 99.98% uptime commitment.\n\nAction Items for NPCI Team:\n\n1.  Provide written confirmation and architectural proof of data residency for the entire multi-currency settlement process.\n2.  Share performance benchmarks (latency, throughput) for the FX rate API.\n3.  Update the API documentation with complete OAuth 2.0 flow details and error code specifications.\n\nOnce we have this information, we can finalize our implementation plan and provide a timeline. We suggest a 30-minute technical sync early next week to discuss these points in detail.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRohit Sharma"],"timestamp":1757916420000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.nair@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["anand.verma@npci.org.in","sunita.patel@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This is a critical compliance risk for the upcoming RBI Data Localization audit with NPCI and requires immediate technical intervention. This issue is being tracked under JIRA PAY-3328.\n\nKibana logs show a recurring pattern of `504 Gateway Timeout` errors when our KYC service calls the NPCI's `/v2/Aadhaar/verify` endpoint. This is happening specifically for profiles flagged by our internal risk engine (as defined in file#458da17f4292453c). It looks like the increased data payload for these high-risk profiles, which includes additional verification parameters, might be causing the NPCI gateway to time out before it can respond. Our internal service timeout is set to 1500ms, which we are consistently breaching.\n\nThe Grafana dashboard for the KYC service shows the p99 latency for this specific transaction type is now at 2.1s, while successful verifications for low-risk segments remain stable at ~450ms. The direct consequence is that these users are not being onboarded, and we are failing to create a complete, auditable electronic trail as mandated by RBI's PSS guidelines. Manually processing this volume is not a viable workaround and will be flagged as a major deficiency by the auditors.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **Aditya Singh (Eng Team):** Can you please lead the investigation into the API timeouts?

Our standard CI/CD pipeline checks for log sanitization seem to have failed or been bypassed.\n*   **Exposure:** The unsanitized logs are being ingested into our primary Kibana instance. While log retention is 7 days, any exposure of these tokens constitutes a critical breach of compliance protocols.\n\nThe initial latency analysis from email 39bbaf772a0a443c seems unrelated, but we must confirm no correlation during the RCA.

The core challenge is integrating real-time forex capabilities into our settlement workflow to ensure full compliance with the RBI Data Localization mandate for Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576.\n\nTechnically, this introduces a critical dependency on an NPCI-provided Forex Rate API. Our current settlement system, `recon-engine-v2`, is designed for INR transactions and would require substantial modification. The preliminary proposal, detailed in file#458da17f4292453c, suggests augmenting the `/v1/settlement/initiate` endpoint with `sourceCurrency`, `targetCurrency`, and `exchangeRateId` fields. This is feasible, but the performance implications are a concern.\n\nOur current p99 latency for settlement initiation is holding steady at 280ms. Introducing a synchronous call to an external forex API could push this beyond our 400ms SLO, especially during peak loads exceeding 15,000 TPS. Furthermore, as noted in the risk register from email ae04d7100af8449d, any downtime in this new API could increase our settlement failure rate, which is currently at a stable 0.12%. We cannot risk audit exposure here; all forex data must be captured in our Kibana audit logs.\n\nTo move forward, we have the following action items:\n\n1.  **NPCI Team:** Can you please provide the OpenAPI specification, documented rate limits, and a firm 99.95% uptime SLA for your Forex Rate API? This is essential for our capacity planning and risk mitigation, tracked under JIRA PAY-8152.\n\n2.  **Sandeep (Juspay Eng):** Please provide a high-level engineering estimate (T-shirt sizing) by next Tuesday for the required changes to `recon-engine-v2` and our associated microservices.\n\n3.  **Myself:** I will schedule a 45-minute technical deep-dive for next week to align on the integration strategy and fallback mechanisms.\n\nLet's ensure we address these dependencies proactively to keep the RBI audit program on schedule.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRohit Sharma"],"timestamp":1757917740000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["arjun.mehta@npci.org.in","sandeep.kumar@juspay.in","priya.desai@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

The p99 latency for our internal `/v1/risk/score` endpoint, which is critical for pre-transaction checks, was holding steady at over 850ms, a significant deviation from our 150ms baseline SLA.\n\nOur analysis of the Kibana logs correlates this spike with a series of slow queries against the read-replica of our primary PostgreSQL instance. It appears that a new set of fraud rules, deployed yesterday, triggered an inefficient query plan that was not caught in staging. This resulted in CPU utilization on the database cluster peaking at 92%, causing cascading delays across the payment processing flow.\n\nThis is a high-priority concern for the RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness Program (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576), as consistent performance under load is a key audit requirement. We cannot afford to have this instability flagged.\n\nImmediate Actions Taken & Next Steps:\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation:** The SRE team has temporarily disabled the problematic rule set. Our Grafana dashboards confirm that API latency has returned to the normal ~140ms range as of 11:30 AM IST.\n\n2.  **Root Cause Analysis:** The data science team is now rewriting the SQL query and adding necessary indexes to the transaction history tables. This work is being tracked under JIRA PAY-7089.\n\n3.  **Vendor Coordination:** I have already initiated a conversation with our counterparts at NPCI to assure them that the latency was internal and did not impact the uptime or response times of the core UPI gateway integration. All heartbeats and settlement reconciliation jobs remained within expected parameters.\n\n4.  **Verification:** The revised rules will be deployed to our performance testing environment by EOD today. We will run a simulation of 50K TPS to validate the fix before promoting it to production.\n\nI will circle back with the performance test results tomorrow morning.

This builds on the initial thread in email 10cf8ff621904031.\n\nThe current design for JIRA PAY-3200 involves an API call to a third-party FX rate provider to handle currency conversion before T+1 settlement. My primary concern is the potential for “Payment System Data,” as defined by RBI, to be transmitted and processed outside of India. We must ensure that no sensitive data—including but not limited to transaction IDs, VPA details, or any personally identifiable information—leaves our India-based infrastructure.\n\nTo be fully compliant, the interaction with the external FX service must be completely anonymized. The settlement service running in our Kubernetes cluster should only query the provider with non-sensitive data (e.g., currency pair 'USD-INR' and the transaction amount). The final reconciliation calculation, linking the FX rate back to a specific transaction, must occur entirely within our secure environment.\n\nFrom a monitoring perspective, we need to implement the following:\n\n1.  **Strict Egress Controls:** Configure network policies for the settlement service pods to whitelist only the required FX provider endpoint and block all other outbound traffic.\n2.  **Audit Logging:** Implement detailed logging for every outbound API call from the settlement module. These logs, stored in Kibana, must be retained for the audit period and explicitly show the anonymized nature of the request payload.\n3.  **Alerting:** Set up alerts in our monitoring system to trigger if the payload size or structure deviates from the approved, anonymized format, which could indicate a data leak.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **@Engineering Team:** Please provide an updated data flow diagram and payload schema for the FX API call by tomorrow, EOD. This is necessary to confirm that our technical implementation aligns with the required compliance posture.\n*   **@Aditya Singh:** Can you confirm if the chosen FX provider has a SOC 2 report and where their endpoints are physically hosted?\n\nThis is a mandatory requirement for the upcoming audit. Failure to prove complete data localization for the entire transaction lifecycle, including settlement, will result in a critical finding.

Building on the initial analysis from email 83f27574ef1d486b, we're seeing a consistent failure rate of 18.5% for customers flagged by our internal Risk Engine, a significant deviation from our <0.5% baseline.\n\nKibana logs show that our KYC service's calls to the NPCI `/v2/customer/verify-kyc` endpoint are consistently resulting in a `GW-504 Gateway Timeout` error after the 2500ms connection timeout threshold is breached. The Grafana 'KYC-Performance-v2' dashboard confirms a p99 latency spike to over 2.5s for this specific transaction profile, while all other KYC verifications remain healthy at a p99 of ~410ms. This does not appear to be a simple volume issue, as our current TPS is well within contracted limits.\n\nThe primary suspect is a processing bottleneck or an undocumented validation rule on NPCI's end when handling profiles with multiple risk indicators. The raw request logs compiled in file#458da17f4292453c confirm that our request payloads are compliant with the specification document discussed in email#ae04d7100af8449d. Unfortunately, the generic `GW-504` response provides no actionable detail for our engineering team.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, this gap is critical.

This has incorrectly blocked an estimated 4,500 legitimate P2M transactions, which are being declined with error code B03 (Transaction not permitted to beneficiary). The issue seems to stem from the new rule set, FS-Rule-Set-IND-V4, which was deployed as part of the broader RBI Data Localization readiness program (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576).\n\nPriya's initial analysis in file#458da17f4292453c confirms that the model's new feature weights for 'transaction_velocity_by_new_device_id' are overly sensitive. Kibana logs show that transactions as low as ₹200 are being flagged without any corroborating risk signals, which is untenable. The details and affected transaction IDs are being tracked in JIRA PAY-4220.\n\nWhile strengthening our fraud posture for the upcoming RBI audit is critical, this level of user friction poses a business risk and could be a point of concern for auditors if it demonstrates a lack of model control.

This prevents our system from obtaining a new access token.\n*   **Performance Degradation:** Consequently, subsequent API calls to critical endpoints like `/upi/payment/initiate` fail. This causes our p99 latency to spike from a baseline of 180ms to over 2.1s, which is unacceptable for our SLA of 99.95% uptime.\n\nThis issue has been escalated and is being tracked under JIRA PAY-3613. The SRE team is investigating potential network path anomalies, but so far, no packet loss has been detected between our production Kubernetes cluster and NPCI's ingress controllers.\n\nI have reached out to our NPCI counterparts to confirm if there have been any unannounced changes to rate-limiting policies or firewall configurations on their end. Until we get a confirmation, we should consider a client-side mitigation. I propose we evaluate a hotfix to implement a more aggressive retry strategy with exponential backoff on the token refresh flow.\n\nWe need to arrange an urgent technical sync with the NPCI team to resolve this.

Our monitoring shows a direct link between these failures and the API timeouts we observed yesterday.\n\n**Technical Analysis & Impact:**\nOur UPI Gateway Grafana dashboard (`upi-gateway-performance`) registered a p99 latency spike to ~1800ms, coinciding with a 4.5% increase in our overall error rate. The majority of these errors were HTTP 504 Gateway Timeouts. Kibana logs from the relevant Kubernetes pods confirm that our service was receiving `401 Unauthorized` errors from NPCI's `/token` endpoint when attempting to use the refresh token.\n\nThe core issue appears to be an aggressive or premature invalidation of the JWT refresh token on the NPCI auth service. Our system's retry logic, which was not anticipating this behavior, entered a rapid retry loop. This exhausted the connection pool in our gateway service, leading to cascading timeouts for new, incoming API requests.

This will prevent future connection pool exhaustion and contain the blast radius of any authentication issues. We need this deployed to our staging environment by 6 PM IST today for verification.\n2.  **[Siddharth Nair]** I will reach out to our technical contacts at NPCI to get formal confirmation on their JWT refresh token lifecycle and TTL policies. We must understand if a recent change was deployed on their end and align our client-side logic to their expected flow.\n\nWe will monitor the staging environment closely post-deployment. Pending successful tests, we will schedule a production rollout during the next maintenance window.\n\nRegards,\n\nSiddharth Nair\nVendor Success Manager | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757921580000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","infra-team@juspay.in","compliance-team@juspay.in","npci.support@npci.org.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This directly violates our internal 800ms SLA, which is a critical control for demonstrating effective real-time fraud prevention to the auditors. A delayed response from this service could lead to processing high-risk transactions, which would be a major finding.\n\nMy review of the Kibana logs from 14:00 to 16:30 IST today confirms a correlation between these latency spikes and an increase in `504 Gateway Timeout` errors. This directly impacts our uptime SLA and could be interpreted by auditors as a systemic failure in our payment processing pipeline. The key concern here is whether the data localization checks themselves are contributing to this delay. We must prove that all payment data processing, including risk scoring, occurs end-to-end within our India-based data centers, as mandated by the RBI circular.\n\nI've updated the risk register for Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576 with this finding. Here are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Aditya):** Can your team investigate the service dependencies for the risk engine? Specifically, we need to confirm that the JWT token validation and any cryptographic operations within the OAuth flow are not making any cross-region calls, even to a key management service. This must be contained within the `IN-Mumbai-1` Kubernetes cluster. Please provide a trace log.\n2.  **SRE (Rohan):** Please implement a high-priority alert for the `/v2/risk/evaluate` endpoint's p99 latency exceeding 1 second. This alert should trigger an immediate page to the on-call SRE and add a notification to the #compliance-alerts channel.\n\nI have created JIRA ticket PAY-2476 to track this issue to resolution and have linked the data flow diagram (`file#458da17f4292453c`) and the previous email thread (`ae04d7100af8449d`) for context.\n\nLet's schedule a 30-minute incident review call tomorrow morning to deep-dive into the root cause. I need to have a documented remediation plan for our pre-audit submission to NPCI by Friday EOD.\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya Nair\nCompliance Specialist\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757921880000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","rohan.mehta@juspay.in","saurav.garg@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

My investigation traces this back to 83 transactions that our system incorrectly flagged as failed.\n\nBuilding on the initial findings in email b1ffed16fccf4ed0, the root cause appears to be an API timeout issue with our primary reconciliation service, `ReconEngine-v2`. Kibana logs show a series of `java.net.SocketTimeoutException` errors between 14:00 and 16:30 IST when the service calls the NPCI `/checkTxnStatus` endpoint. Our Grafana monitoring confirms this, with p99 latency for that specific endpoint spiking to ~1850ms, breaching our 750ms SLA and the service's hardcoded 1500ms timeout.\n\nEffectively, our system gave up before NPCI could return a final 'SUCCESS' status. The reconciliation job then prematurely marked these transactions with an internal `RECON_TIMEOUT_FAIL` status, while NPCI's ledger correctly shows them as successful. This discrepancy is what we're seeing in the final settlement file (`file#458da17f4292453c`).\n\nThis is a critical issue for the RBI Data Localization audit (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576), as it directly impacts ledger integrity and our documented exception handling protocols.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **[Ops - Anjali]** I am initiating a manual reconciliation for the 83 affected transactions to ensure correct merchant settlement. This will be completed by EOD today. I've documented the `juspay_txn_id`s in JIRA PAY-8230.\n2.  **[Engineering - Aditya]** Can your team please evaluate and implement a more resilient handling mechanism in `ReconEngine-v2`? I suggest we prioritize implementing a retry strategy with exponential backoff for timeouts on the `/checkTxnStatus` call, rather than simply increasing the timeout value. This should provide a more robust long-term fix.\n\nLet's connect tomorrow morning to finalize the engineering approach before any changes are pushed to the staging environment. I will schedule a 30-minute call.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead"],"timestamp":1757922300000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","rohan.mehra@juspay.in","compliance.team@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This has become a critical blocker for our RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness Program (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576) and needs immediate attention.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show that since approximately 11:30 AM IST, API calls to the UPI gateway are experiencing significant timeouts. The p99 latency on endpoints like `/v2/payment/status` has spiked from a baseline of 210ms to over 1800ms. Kibana logs confirm the root cause: our service is receiving `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` responses from NPCI's systems. The error rate is currently fluctuating around 3.5%, which is well above our SLA threshold of 0.2%.\n\nIt appears our OAuth 2.0 client is failing to refresh the JWT access token before it expires. The initial token grant is successful, but the subsequent refresh flow is timing out or being rejected. This is causing a cascade failure where our Kubernetes pods are cycling through connection attempts, exhausting resources, and failing to process transactions. This was briefly mentioned in the thread on email 482421dd3b78426e, but the impact has now grown significantly.\n\nThe immediate risk is our inability to demonstrate stable and compliant transaction processing for the upcoming audit. As per the guidelines in file#458da17f4292453c, any sustained authentication failure will be a major red flag.\n\nAction items:\n1.  **[Ankit/SRE Team]** Please prioritize the investigation for JIRA PAY-8311. We need to determine if this is a configuration drift on our end, a clock skew issue between our servers and NPCI's, or an unannounced change on their `/token/refresh` endpoint.\n2.  **[Priya/Security Team]** Can you review the token lifecycle management logic? Is it possible to implement a more aggressive pre-expiry refresh buffer as a temporary mitigation?\n3.  I will open a high-priority ticket with our technical contacts at NPCI, referencing this issue and its impact on the audit timeline.\n\nLet's schedule a war-room call for 3:00 PM IST today to sync on findings and define a path to resolution.

The analysis from our earlier Slack thread and the Grafana dashboard (`upi-vendor-perf-v2`) confirms we are consistently hitting NPCI's documented 4,500 TPS cap during evening peak hours, leading to a surge in `HTTP 429` (Too Many Requests) errors. This isn't just a performance issue; it directly impacts our ability to demonstrate stable and predictable processing capacity, a key tenet of the data localization audit.\n\nOur current ad-hoc retry logic in the payment-gateway is proving insufficient and, in some cases, is causing a retry storm that exacerbates the problem, pushing p99 latency for UPI transactions over 2200ms. We need a more sophisticated approach. We'll review two primary strategies: 1) Implementing an exponential backoff with jitter directly within the Hyper SDK client that connects to NPCI, and 2) A more stateful approach involving an in-memory queue within the gateway to smooth out traffic bursts before they hit the vendor API.\n\nLet's aim to leave this meeting with a firm decision on the path forward. We need to weigh the engineering effort of the queuing system against the potential for slightly increased average latency with the backoff strategy. Rohan, please come prepared to discuss the implementation complexity for both options. Aditya, your input on the acceptable customer experience trade-offs will be vital.

The root cause is traced to transactions where our UPI gateway service, 'HyperUPI', experiences a client-side timeout while awaiting the 'RespPay' callback from NPCI's switch. These transactions are internally flagged with our custom error code 'T707 - Gateway Await Timeout', yet a subset of them have successfully completed on the remitter bank's side. This leads to a mismatch where we have a failed status but the funds are included in the NPCI settlement batch, creating reconciliation failures in our 'Recon-Saras' microservice.","The data from our Prometheus metrics dashboard shows a spike in 'T707' errors during peak hours (18:00-20:00 IST), correlating directly with the settlement file mismatches. The current reconciliation logic does not have a provision for re-querying the status of these timed-out transactions before finalizing the daily books. This poses a direct compliance risk for the RBI Data Localization audit, as it demonstrates an inability to maintain an accurate, real-time transaction state ledger. The absence of a final, authoritative status for these transactions in our India-domiciled data stores is a critical finding that must be remediated.","As an immediate corrective action, we propose enhancing the 'Recon-Saras' service to incorporate an asynchronous, delayed status check mechanism. For any transaction logged with code 'T707', the service will trigger a 'ReqTxnConfirmation' API call to the NPCI UPI switch after a 60-minute cooling-off period. The response will be used to update the transaction's final state in the `pg-txn-primary` database.

During simulated peak volume mirroring NPCI's batch settlement window, our Kafka consumer service, `cbs-writer-v3`, experienced significant lag, exceeding 500,000 messages. Grafana metrics from the `ap-south-1` RDS Postgres instance show P99 commit latencies spiking to 950ms, causing a cascading failure with `ERR_DB_WRITE_TIMEOUT_504` errors in the consumer logs. This directly impacts our ability to meet the RPO of 5 minutes required for the RBI data localization mandate, as the WAL archival process is unable to keep pace with the ingress transaction rate from the `upi-settlements-topic`.","The root cause has been isolated to I/O contention on the primary database node, specifically related to the `synchronous_commit = 'on'` configuration. Each transaction commit is waiting for the WAL record to be flushed to the gp3 EBS volume before acknowledging the write to the Kafka consumer. While this ensures maximum durability, it creates a serial bottleneck under high concurrency. Further analysis of `pg_stat_activity` during the spike shows a high number of processes in the `Commit` wait state, corroborating the `fsync` contention hypothesis. The current setup is not leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of our multi-AZ RDS deployment for write-intensive workloads.","To mitigate this ahead of the audit deadline, I recommend two parallel actions. First, for the `cbs-writer-v3` service, we will implement a conditional change to `synchronous_commit = 'local'` via our Terraform configuration. This will allow commits to proceed once the WAL is written to local memory, decoupling the process from the disk flush latency; the risk of data loss is minimal (<1 second) and acceptable for settlement reconciliation processes which have built-in idempotency. Second, the SRE team must initiate a procurement and testing cycle for Provisioned IOPS (io2 Block Express) volumes for the WAL partition, aiming for a baseline of 20,000 IOPS. Both changes must be validated in the pre-production environment against the `RBI-Audit-Sim-v2` test plan by EOD Friday."],"owner":"Anjali Patel","ownerEmail":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","photoLink":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/photo8","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","anjali.patel@juspay.in","tech-leads@juspay.in","product-team@juspay.in","compliance@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"application/json","createdAt":1757910600000,"updatedAt":1757910600000}},

Our internal settlement system is reporting a shortfall of INR 4,32,150.75 against the transaction volume logged by our UPI gateway.\n\nBuilding on the initial analysis from Aditya in email b1ad92b06c48477d, our team has confirmed the discrepancy. The issue appears to originate from 342 specific transactions. These transactions were marked as `SUCCESS` via the `/v2/payment/status` endpoint and successfully acknowledged by our systems, but they are absent from the final settlement file (file#63fbabc0fae048ef) provided by NPCI for the T+1 cycle.\n\nWe have logged this under JIRA PAY-1036 and have attached a CSV containing the `juspay_txn_id`s and their corresponding `npc_rrn`s for the affected transactions. Our Grafana dashboards show no abnormal activity—our UPI gateway latency remained stable at a p95 of 180ms, and error rates held below our 0.2% threshold during the impacted period. Kibana log analysis for these transaction IDs confirms successful 200 OK responses from the NPCI API endpoints at the time of transaction.\n\nThis reconciliation gap is a critical blocker for our ongoing RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness program (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576).

This issue is critically impacting our data synchronization process for the RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness Program (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576).\n\nBuilding on the initial findings from email 151c28ed781d480f, here is what our monitoring shows:\n\n1.  **Symptom:** Since approximately 11:40 AM IST, we are seeing a significant spike in `504 Gateway Timeout` errors on API calls that require NPCI authentication. Our overall error rate to your endpoints has jumped from a baseline of 0.2% to 3.8%.\n\n2.  **Root Cause:** Our Grafana dashboards correlate these timeouts directly with failures originating from calls to NPCI's `/oauth/token` endpoint. The p99 latency for this specific API call has degraded from a normal ~250ms to over 1,800ms before resulting in a `401 Unauthorized` response. This is happening despite our system presenting a valid, non-expired refresh token.\n\n3.  **Logs & Evidence:** Kibana logs for our token management service show successful token acquisition, followed by repeated failures during the subsequent refresh cycle. We have ruled out configuration issues on our side; our client credentials and Kubernetes deployment configurations have not changed. The behavior points towards a potential issue with refresh token validation on the NPCI server side, as documented in JIRA PAY-1109.\n\nThis is preventing us from fetching transaction data, which is a mandatory requirement for the upcoming audit. We need to resolve this with utmost priority.\n\n**Action Items for NPCI Team:**\n\n*   Can you please immediately investigate the logs for our client ID (`JUSPAY_PROD_9A8B7C`) against your `/oauth/token` endpoint for the period starting 11:30 AM IST today?\n*   Please confirm if any new rate-limiting policies, WAF rules, or changes to the token validation logic were deployed to your OAuth infrastructure recently.\n*   Provide an RCA and a firm ETA for the resolution.\n\nAditya and Priya from our engineering team are on standby to join a technical bridge call.

Instead of being processed entirely within our domestic infrastructure before handoff to the NPCI gateway, the transaction requests were transiently forwarded to an external, non-domestic partner gateway. \n\nOur Kibana log analysis indicates this affected roughly 3,200 transactions. While the transactions ultimately failed with a `504 Gateway Timeout` and were not processed, the initial request containing sensitive payment data (masked PAN, transaction amount, merchant details) left our domestic boundary. This constitutes a material deviation from the RBI's directive on Storage of Payment System Data (RBI/2017-18/153).\n\n**Technical Details:**\nThe issue has been traced to a legacy routing rule within the Kubernetes config map for the `payment-router-v4` service. It seems this rule was not correctly deprecated during the last CI/CD deployment on Tuesday evening. The rule was triggered by a specific combination of a non-resident acquiring bank BIN and a specific product code, causing the system to bypass the primary domestic processing flow.\n\n**Compliance Impact (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576):**\nThis incident is a reportable event under our audit framework (ref: file#63fbabc0fae048ef). Even though the data was transient and the transactions were not completed, the outbound request itself is a breach of the data localization principle. We must have a complete remediation and incident report prepared for the NPCI audit team.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Remediation (DevOps/SRE):** A hotfix to remove the erroneous routing rule from the production config map must be deployed immediately. Please confirm once the change is live. A full rollback is not advised due to other critical fixes in the same deployment.\n2.  **Impact Quantification (Data Team):** Provide a definitive list of all affected `transaction_ids` and associated merchant IDs from the `payment-router-v4` logs for the period 09:00 to 12:00 IST. **Deadline: 4 PM IST today.**\n3.  **Post-Mortem & RCA (Engineering):** A formal RCA document must be prepared detailing how the legacy rule persisted through testing and deployment checks. This is tracked under JIRA PAY-3028. **Deadline: 11 AM IST tomorrow.**\n4.  **Compliance Reporting (Priya Nair):** I will begin drafting the official incident report for legal and executive review, incorporating the findings from the above action items.\n\nWe need to treat this with the highest urgency.

The Grafana dashboard clearly shows this began post-deployment last Tuesday.\n\n2.  **Root Cause Analysis:** Kibana log analysis (query details in file#63fbabc0fae048ef) reveals that the database read operations for fetching user risk profiles are the primary bottleneck. While CPU/memory on the risk engine's Kubernetes pods are stable, the disk I/O wait times on the database nodes are consistently high. My hypothesis is that the Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) layer, a requirement for the audit, is introducing significant overhead that was not fully captured in staging due to lower TPS simulations (ref: email#b1ad92b06c48477d).\n\n3.  **Business Impact:** This latency is directly contributing to a 1.2% increase in transaction timeouts, manifesting as `U16` (Transaction timed out at Payee PSP) error codes in our NPCI reconciliation reports. This poses a direct risk to our audit readiness posture for Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **[Infra Team]** - Please prioritize analysis of the PostgreSQL TDE configuration and underlying storage performance. Can we explore performance tuning or a more aggressive caching strategy via our Redis layer for hot risk profiles? Let's get an assessment by EOD tomorrow.\n*   **[Dev Team]** - We need to review the data access logic within the scoring engine.

Our internal analysis on historical data shows that for currency pairs like USD/INR and EUR/INR, intra-day volatility can cause reconciliation discrepancies of up to 0.75%. The current proposal doesn't specify how the final settlement amount is calculated and communicated if the FX rate at T+1 differs from the rate at the time of transaction authorization.\n\nTechnically, our settlement engine expects a fixed, final amount in the daily settlement batch file. Any deviation requires manual intervention, which is not scalable given our target of 10K TPS for international transactions. The associated development effort on our side is being tracked in JIRA PAY-5652. To move forward, we need clarity on the following from NPCI's side:\n\n1.  **API Specification:** Can you provide the exact API response payload (preferably a Swagger/OpenAPI spec) for a multi-currency transaction? Specifically, we need to see how the locked-in FX rate, source amount, and final settlement amount in INR are represented.\n\n2.  **Reconciliation Endpoint:** Will the existing `/v1/settlements/reconciliation` endpoint be enhanced to include these new fields, or will a new endpoint be provisioned? This is crucial for our Kibana log parsing and alerting setup.\n\n3.  **Failure Handling:** What error codes will be returned if a settlement fails due to FX rate tolerance breaches? We need to map these to our internal error handling logic to maintain our 99.95% settlement success SLA.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **NPCI Team:** Please provide the detailed API specification and clarification on the reconciliation endpoint by EOD, November 18th.\n*   **Aditya Singh:** Please update the impact analysis in JIRA PAY-5652 based on the potential changes to our settlement reconciliation logic.\n\nOnce we have this information, we can finalize the integration plan and update the project timeline for the RBI audit readiness program.

Kibana logs show these transactions erroneously hitting the `/api/v2/process_domestic_payment` endpoint instead of the designated `/api/v2/process_international_payment` endpoint, as defined in our architecture spec (file#63fbabc0fae048ef). This contradicts the agreed-upon logic from our last review in email 7c974b3980214265.\n\nThe DevOps team rolled back the deployment at 16:05 IST, and our Grafana 'UPI-Gateway-Routing-Monitor' confirms all cross-border traffic since then has been routed correctly. Error rates on the international leg are back to the baseline of 0.12%.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **Risk & Ops (My Team):** I am initiating a full audit of all transaction logs for the 90-minute incident window. We will produce a definitive list of all impacted PANs and associated transaction data for our formal incident report. ETA: EOD tomorrow.\n2.  **DevOps/SRE:** Please implement a mandatory, automated pre-deployment check to validate the country-code mapping file against the golden source repository. This must be added as a blocking step in the CI/CD pipeline for the UPI gateway by EOW. We cannot risk a repeat of this.\n3.  **Compliance (Priya):** Please prepare to engage our NPCI liaison. We will need to self-report this deviation as part of our audit readiness program. We should have the full impact report ready for your review by tomorrow, 17:00 IST.\n\nWe need to schedule a brief post-mortem with all stakeholders tomorrow to finalize the incident report and confirm preventative measures are in place.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjali Patel\nRisk & Operations Lead"],"timestamp":1757916300000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"anjali.patel@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.sharma@juspay.in","devops-alerts@juspay.in","security-team@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This issue, which we initially flagged in email 03100641e7f74098, is now a critical blocker for our RBI Data Localization audit readiness under Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show that while overall API health is green, the `/verifyCustomerProfile/v2.1` endpoint is returning a `422 Unprocessable Entity` error for these specific requests. Latency is not the issue; p99 response time is stable at 320ms. The Kibana logs indicate the rejection is happening pre-processing on NPCI's side, which strongly suggests a data validation or schema mismatch. Our OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token generation remain healthy, ruling out authentication as the root cause.\n\nThis appears to be a payload-specific problem. My hypothesis is that a recent, perhaps minor, change in NPCI's validation logic for high-risk profiles was not captured in our latest integration spec review (reference file#63fbabc0fae048ef). The manual verification fallback is causing operational strain and introduces a data handling risk we cannot afford pre-audit.\n\nI have updated the primary ticket JIRA PAY-7027 with logs and a sample of failing transaction IDs.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Aditya (Engineering):** Please prioritize a deep dive into the request payloads for the failing cases. We need to validate our data mapping against NPCI's live schema for these segments. A potential mismatch in enumeration values or data format for address fields is a likely culprit.\n2.  **Priya (Compliance):** Can you quantify the immediate risk exposure?

The issue is a critical misconfiguration in our payment routing logic, which has significant compliance implications.\n\nBuilding on the initial findings from email 7d24d2bbabae4def, our investigation using Kibana logs reveals that our `payment-router-service` is incorrectly forwarding transactions from specific international BINs (primarily from the US and Singapore) to the domestic NPCI-UPI gateway endpoint. This is a direct violation of data localization guidelines, as this data must not traverse domestic-only systems.\n\nOur Grafana metrics show a near 100% failure rate for these transactions, returning an internal error code `ERR_INVALID_ROUTING_TARGET` before the request is even sent to NPCI. This appears to stem from a faulty ruleset deployed in our Kubernetes environment on Tuesday at approx. 18:30 IST, which seems to have overridden the geo-IP-based routing predicates. The JWT authentication flow for these transactions is failing as a result, as the tokens are being generated for the wrong audience (domestic vs. international gateway).\n\nThis has been classified as a P0 incident and is being tracked under JIRA PAY-2303.\n\nHere is the immediate action plan:\n1.  **DevOps Team:** Roll back the configuration on the `payment-router-service` to the last known stable version (pre-Tuesday deployment). This is the immediate priority.\n2.  **QA Team:** Once the rollback is complete in the staging environment, please execute the full cross-border payment test suite, focusing on multi-geo BIN validation. We need 100% pass rate before promoting to production.\n3.  **My Action:** I will prepare a preliminary incident report for our compliance team and NPCI, detailing the issue, impact, and remediation steps, using the data from file#63fbabc0fae048ef.\n\nWe need this fully resolved and validated by EOD to mitigate any risk for the upcoming audit.

The external auditor has identified a potential violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 concerning the protection of stored cardholder data.\n\nIt appears that unmasked Primary Account Numbers (PANs) are being logged in plain text within our UPI gateway's transaction processing logs. Initial analysis points to the `upi-transaction-processor` Kubernetes pods, with logs being ingested into our primary Kibana instance. The issue seems to originate at the pre-authorization stage, potentially before our `pan-masking-service` is invoked. This could be a race condition or a configuration error in the request flow.\n\nOur investigation of the Kibana logs confirms this, though the occurrences are intermittent. We've estimated an impact rate of ~0.2% of transactions, concentrated during peak hours (11 AM - 2 PM IST) when system load exceeds 60k TPS. This suggests a potential link to service latency or resource constraints. The auditor's evidence is attached in `file#63fbabc0fae048ef`, corroborating our findings.\n\nThis is a Severity 1 issue.

I've updated the list of `juspay_txn_id`s in `file#63fbabc0fae048ef`.\n\nA review of the Kibana logs for this transaction cohort shows successful `200 OK` responses from the `/upi/payment/v2` endpoint, and the corresponding NPCI transaction IDs were captured correctly. We are not seeing any `TXN_TIMEOUT` or `REVERSAL_PENDING` flags in our system for these payments. This suggests the issue might be downstream, either in the NPCI settlement batching process or a communication gap in their final status update API.\n\nThis discrepancy poses a direct risk to our audit readiness. The inability to present a 100% reconciled transaction lifecycle for UPI payments will be a major red flag for the auditors. The integrity of our data localization claims hinges on this.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Aditya (Eng):** Can your team please initiate a deep-dive on the affected `juspay_txn_id`s?

This violates the sub-second processing requirement for UPI transactions.\n*   **Error Rate:** We observed a transaction failure rate of 1.8% at a simulated load of only 12,000 TPS, far below our target capacity. The primary error code appears to be `GW_504_TIMEOUT` originating from the new localized data store.\n*   **System Vitals:** The Grafana dashboard for the staging Kubernetes cluster shows consistent CPU throttling on the DB proxy pods and a saturation of available connections. Kibana logs confirm a high incidence of `DB_CONN_TIMEOUT` errors during these periods.\n\nFrom a business and compliance perspective, this bottleneck is a showstopper. It prevents us from proceeding to the UAT phase with NPCI and jeopardizes our ability to meet the audit deadline. The system in its current state cannot guarantee the data processing and residency mandates required by the RBI.\n\nThe initial hypothesis, tracked in JIRA PAY-7632, points toward an inefficient database query or a misconfiguration in the connection pooling mechanism within the new architecture.

This breach of our internal 500ms SLA lasted for approximately 45 minutes, impacting an estimated 2.8% of transactions requiring real-time risk assessment. \n\nKibana logs from the affected Kubernetes pods show a high incidence of `SQLSTATE[08006]` connection timeout errors. This points towards a database connection pool exhaustion issue. It looks like the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) configuration for the scoring service did not adequately scale for the increased transaction volume following the recent onboarding of a new UPI partner. The current HPA is configured to scale at 80% CPU utilization, but the bottleneck appears to be I/O wait on the database, not CPU.\n\nThis incident is critical in the context of our RBI Data Localization audit readiness (Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576), as sustained high latency could jeopardize our compliance with real-time processing mandates. The analysis in file#63fbabc0fae048ef suggests that while our infrastructure is the primary cause, the payload size from NPCI's `CommonRealTime` API endpoint is a contributing factor to processing overhead.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation:** Ankit's team will deploy a hotfix to increase the max DB connection pool size from 100 to 200 and adjust the HPA trigger to a combination of CPU and memory usage.

This creates an incomplete lifecycle record. We cannot definitively prove to auditors that 100% of the payment data for these attempts resided exclusively within India, as required by the RBI mandate.\n2.  **Data Mismatches:** The analysis in `file#63fbabc0fae048ef` highlights a growing discrepancy between initiated transactions at the app layer and those successfully logged in our secure compliance vault. This is a critical failure point that will be flagged during an audit.\n3.  **JIRA PAY-2608:** The issue, tracked under this ticket, is now escalated to 'High' priority from a compliance standpoint. The current transaction drop from a target of 715 TPS to an effective ~630 TPS is secondary to the logging failure.\n\nWe need to address this immediately. Before we escalate to NPCI to request a higher rate limit—a process that can be lengthy—we must ensure our internal handling is robust.

Our primary Grafana dashboard confirms that p99 latency for the `/v2/risk/evaluate` endpoint spiked from a baseline of ~150ms to 875ms yesterday between 16:30 and 17:15 IST. This coincided with our peak transaction volume, hitting approximately 65k TPS.\n\nKibana logs from that period show a sharp increase in `DB_CONN_TIMEOUT` errors originating from the scoring service. We've cross-referenced this with our Kubernetes monitoring and can confirm there were no pod restarts, OOM kills, or CPU/memory throttling events. This suggests the infrastructure itself was stable, and the problem is likely application-level.\n\nMy primary hypothesis is that the new fraud rule set deployed two days ago is causing inefficient, long-running queries that are exhausting the database connection pool under heavy load. The query performance degradation seems to be exponential as transaction volume scales.\n\nThis latency has a direct impact on our overall transaction processing SLA and is a significant risk for the upcoming RBI Data Localization audit readiness assessment with NPCI.

This is a critical development for the RBI Data Localization audit readiness program (Work ID: c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576) and expands on the initial concerns raised in email 06403d11f5454f08.\n\nOur Grafana dashboard (RBI-Compliance-Monitor) shows a sharp increase in errors originating from our primary KYC service running in the Mumbai K8s cluster. Kibana logs (index: `kyc-automation-prod-*`) confirm the issue is concentrated on API calls to NPCI's `/v2/ckyc/search` endpoint. We are seeing a high volume of `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` responses, specifically for customer profiles flagged by our internal risk engine as 'High'. The p99 latency on these specific calls is averaging 3,200ms, a stark contrast to the 450ms observed for low-risk segments.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, this failure to automate onboarding for a specific risk category constitutes a material weakness we must report. The inability to generate a complete, localized C-KYC record for these users directly impacts our audit evidence. I have updated JIRA PAY-4826 with log samples and trace IDs, which seem to indicate the issue might be related to payload size or complexity for these specific user profiles, potentially triggering a processing bottleneck on NPCI's side.\n\nAction Items:\n1.  **Engineering (cc'd Aditya):** Please immediately begin a root cause analysis. Isolate the request payloads for the failing profiles and determine if they deviate from the API specification outlined in `file#63fbabc0fae048ef`. We need to confirm this is not an issue with our JWT token generation or OAuth flow for these sessions.\n2.  **SRE Team:** Can you establish if there are any network-level issues between our Mumbai cluster and NPCI's ingress points? All other NPCI integrations appear to be operating within their 99.9% uptime SLA.\n3.  **My Team:** I will prepare a risk mitigation report detailing the potential compliance impact and a proposal for a manual fallback process, though this is not scalable and presents its own data handling risks.\n\nWe must have a definitive path to resolution by tomorrow, EOD.

This is causing a significant increase in the manual review queue, jeopardizing our T+0 settlement targets for high-volume merchants. Based on the Grafana dashboard (Fraud-Model-Performance-v3), this surge directly correlates with the new rule set (v4.1.2) deployed yesterday. The Kibana logs suggest rule `FR-78B` (transaction velocity from new device fingerprints) is the primary contributor, accounting for ~70% of the new false positives.\n\nThis isn't just an operational issue; an unstable risk engine is a major red flag for the upcoming NPCI audit.

The current T+2 settlement cycle for cross-border transactions introduces significant reconciliation friction, with our Grafana dashboards showing a 0.8% discrepancy rate over the last 30 days. This requires manual intervention and is unlikely to meet the auditor's standards for automated processing.\n\nTo mitigate this risk for Work ID c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576, we need to optimize this flow. The business requirement is to move towards a T+1 settlement cycle, which necessitates tighter integration with NPCI's systems.\n\nTechnically, this involves two key workstreams:\n\n1.  **Internal API Enhancement:** Our current settlement microservice struggles with dynamic Forex rates. We probably need to enhance the `/v3/settlement/initiate-cross-border` endpoint to accept a new `forexRateId` parameter returned by NPCI. This would lock in the rate at the time of transaction, simplifying the reconciliation logic that currently runs in our batch processing pods on Kubernetes. This effort should be tracked under JIRA PAY-6030.\n\n2.  **NPCI API Clarification:** There seems to be ambiguity in how NPCI's `/getForexQuote` API handles rate validity. The documentation in file#63fbabc0fae048ef is unclear whether the quote is valid for the entire transaction lifecycle or just for a few seconds. If the rate expires before our system consumes it, we'll continue to see reconciliation failures. We must get a definitive answer on the JWT token-based session validity for these quotes.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Aditya:** Can you please scope the engineering effort required for the API enhancement and update the technical specification in JIRA PAY-6030 by EOD Friday?

The issue seems to stem from a new set of fraud rules deployed last Wednesday which introduced a complex, multi-table join query for transaction history enrichment.\n\n2.  **Query Performance:** The specific query is taking over 600ms to execute under load. It appears the `transaction_metadata` table lacks a necessary index for the new join condition, causing a full table scan for a high percentage of scoring requests.\n\n3.  **Compliance Impact:** From a compliance standpoint, this latency is a critical concern. Any sustained p99 latency above our 350ms internal SLA could be flagged by auditors as a systemic risk to the stability of our payment processing flow. Furthermore, I've noticed that the audit logging service is timing out on some of these slow requests, resulting in incomplete audit trails. This is a direct violation of the data integrity requirements under the RBI guidelines and must be rectified immediately.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Rohan:** Please lead the effort to analyze the problematic query.

It appears the `transaction_date` in NPCI's file differs from our Euler ledger's `created_at` timestamp for transactions occurring between 23:55 and 00:05 IST. I've reviewed the Grafana dashboard 'upi-settlement-latency' and it shows a correlation with p99 latency spikes in the payment-gateway during that window. Is this a timezone issue in the recon job, or a race condition in the Euler ledger population script? We need engineering's take on this.\n\nProposed Agenda & Outcomes:\n1.  Review Vikram's BigQuery findings (Dataset: `juspay_prod.reconciliation.npci_upi_settlements_v3`).\n2.  Isolate the root cause: Is it a code-level bug, an infrastructure timing issue, or a misinterpretation of NPCI's spec?\n3.  **Action Item (AI) - Owner: Rohan Sharma:** Based on the discussion, commit to an investigation path for the reconciliation batch processor and the timestamp logic. A sub-task under PAY-1999 is required by EOD.\n4.  **AI - Owner: Vikram Singh:** Prepare a full impact report quantifying the total monetary discrepancy over the last 90 days. We need this for the audit trail by Friday.\n5.  **Decision:** Formalize our internal findings before scheduling a follow-up with our NPCI contacts.","status":"confirmed","createdAt":1757929980000,"updatedAt":1757931780000,"app":"google-calendar","entity":"event","creator":{"displayName":"Priya Nair","email":"priya.nair@juspay.in"},"startTime":1757929980000,"endTime":1757933580000,"joiningLink":"https://meet.google.com/2f5-4daf-f55","permissions":["priya.nair@juspay.in","rohan.sharma@juspay.in","anjali.mehta@juspay.in","vikram.singh@juspay.in","aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"]}},

The issue manifests as a mismatch between transactions marked 'SUCCESS' in our primary PostgreSQL `payments` database and the entries in the T+1 settlement `.DAT` file received from NPCI. Investigation shows these discrepancies are almost exclusively tied to transactions that initially receive an NPCI response code of `U30` (Transaction timed out at Payee PSP) but are later confirmed as successful via a server-to-server callback. Our current `txn_reconciliation_service`, which runs nightly at 02:00 IST, is failing to correctly pair the Retrieval Reference Number (RRN) for these specific transactions, creating an incomplete audit trail that poses a significant risk for the upcoming RBI inspection.","The root cause is identified as a race condition within our Kafka-based event processing architecture. The `upi_callback_consumer` service, responsible for processing asynchronous success notifications from NPCI, commits the final 'SUCCESS' status to the database before the initial `U30` transaction state has been fully processed and logged by the upstream services. Consequently, the reconciliation job queries a state that doesn't reflect the terminal status change, leading to the mismatch. This behavior circumvents our intended event-sourcing pattern, as the state change is not atomically reflected in the reconciliation staging tables, breaking the chain of evidence required to prove data integrity and localization compliance for every transaction.","As a remediation strategy under JIRA PAY-2670, two actions are required. For immediate mitigation, the engineering team must develop and deploy a backfill script that queries all transactions with an initial `U30` response from the last 90 days. This script will perform a forced status check using the NPCI `getTxnStatus` API and patch the `reconciliation_logs` table to close the audit gap. For a long-term solution, the architecture must be modified: the `upi_callback_consumer` will be reconfigured to publish a new `txn_status_finalized` event to a dedicated Kafka topic. A new idempotent consumer service will then be responsible for atomically updating both the primary `payments` table and the `reconciliation_logs`, guaranteeing data consistency and providing a robust, auditable record for every UPI transaction state change, thereby satisfying RBI requirements."],"owner":"Priya Nair","ownerEmail":"priya.nair@juspay.in","photoLink":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/photo4","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.nair@juspay.in","tech-leads@juspay.in","product-team@juspay.in","compliance@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"application/json","createdAt":1757993400000,"updatedAt":1757993400000}},

We are observing a 4.2% false positive rate for transactions originating from tier-2 cities, a significant deviation from the projected 0.5% baseline. This has resulted in a surge of `U41` (Transaction declined by remitter bank) responses from the NPCI switch, directly impacting the user experience for our early adopters of this credit line product. The primary driver appears to be an over-weighting of the 'device_freshness_score' feature, which is being disproportionately flagged for users who have recently installed or updated the ICICI iMobile Pay app, a common behavior pattern in the onboarding phase for this new product.","Drilling down into the feature vectors consumed by Orion from our Kafka topic `icici_credit_tx_stream`, it's evident the model's training data did not adequately account for the initial user lifecycle of a credit-based UPI product. The model is incorrectly correlating high-velocity app updates with fraudulent activity. Our current risk threshold configuration is set to a static 85 for all transaction values, which lacks the nuance required for this new payment instrument. This rigid configuration is converting moderate risk scores, generated due to the device freshness feature, into hard declines, leading to a precision of 0.68 when our target is >0.95 for this transaction category.","As an immediate corrective action, I recommend we deploy a dynamic thresholding rule within the Orion configuration service. For transactions where `customer.onboarding_age_days` < 30, the risk score contributed by the 'device_freshness_score' feature should be attenuated by 50%. This can be implemented as a pre-processing rule before the score is finalized. For a long-term fix tracked under PAY-1069, the data science team must initiate a model retraining pipeline, incorporating a labeled dataset of these false positives from the past 72 hours.

I've been investigating this as a top priority for Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41, and it's clear the issue stems from our fraud detection model generating an excessive number of false positives.\n\n**Investigation & Impact Analysis:**\n\nBuilding on the initial analysis from file bf6e234e1ab14061, I've confirmed the issue through our monitoring stack. Here's what I've found:\n\n1.  **Error Spike:** Our Grafana dashboard (`UPI-Gateway-Performance`) shows a significant spike in our internal error code `F5 - Transaction Declined (Suspected Fraud)`. The false positive rate jumped from a baseline of ~0.4% to a peak of 4.8% on the traffic routed through the new model. These declines are happening pre-emptively within our infrastructure before the authorization request is sent to ICICI's `/credit-line/authorize` endpoint.\n\n2.  **Performance Degradation:** This has directly impacted throughput, with successful TPS dropping from a steady 15K to around 12.5K during the observed period. The p99 latency for these specific transaction flows has also degraded, increasing from an average of 250ms to ~850ms due to the added processing time of the fraud model before it ultimately rejects the transaction.\n\n3.  **Log Analysis:** I've examined the Kibana logs for several hundred flagged transaction IDs. The payloads sent to the fraud detection service are well-formed, and the OAuth 2.0 flow with JWT token validation is completing successfully. The model appears to be overly sensitive, particularly flagging legitimate-looking, high-value transactions originating from newer devices, even when other risk parameters are low.\n\n**Immediate Actions & Next Steps:**\n\nTo mitigate immediate customer impact, I have already adjusted the Kubernetes deployment configuration to reduce the model's active traffic participation from 10% down to 1%. For the remaining 9% of traffic, we will continue to run the model in shadow mode, logging its decision without blocking the transaction flow. This will allow us to gather data without disrupting service.\n\nThe core issue seems to be with the model's calibration, which is tracked under JIRA PAY-3136. I've attached the relevant log exports and a list of falsely flagged transaction IDs to the ticket.\n\n@Priya Sharma: Could you please prioritize a root-cause analysis of the model's feature weighting and thresholds? We need to understand why it's performing so differently from our UAT simulations. An ETA for a recalibrated model would be extremely helpful. The current state jeopardizes our launch timeline and doesn't align with RBI guidelines that require a balance between fraud prevention and a seamless customer experience.\n\nI will continue to monitor the dashboards and alert thresholds closely.

Your points on the reconciliation challenges for cross-border transactions are spot on and align with the performance dips our team has been flagging.\n\nBuilding on that analysis, we've been deep-diving into our Grafana metrics for the UPI Credit Line service (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41). We've confirmed that the p99 latency for our current `/settlement/forex_quote` API calls is averaging around 1.9 seconds during the EU and US market open times. This is well above our internal SLO of 750ms and is the primary contributor to the T+1 settlement delay we're trying to eliminate.\n\nOur Kibana logs correlate this with intermittent `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors, which points to a bottleneck, possibly in how we are handling the JWT token validation within the request-response cycle for each currency conversion. The current synchronous process is clearly not scalable for the projected 15,000 TPS volume.\n\nTo address this and meet the RBI's updated guidelines for near-real-time settlement, our engineering team has drafted a proposal for an optimized flow. The core idea is to introduce an asynchronous settlement process using a dedicated microservice. This service will manage forex rate fetching and caching, aiming to bring quote retrieval latency down to under 250ms. We believe this is achievable by implementing a more efficient OAuth 2.0 flow with persistent tokens, reducing the authentication overhead per transaction.\n\nThis proposed architecture is outlined in the technical specification document I've attached (Doc#24a5059bf3a047e0). It has been designed to be fully compliant with SOC 2 and PCI DSS standards, with no change to the current encryption protocols or audit logging mechanisms. We are tracking this initiative under JIRA PAY-8190.\n\nTo move forward, we have a few action items:\n\n1.  **ICICI Team (Anand):** Could you please review the proposed architecture in Doc#24a5059bf3a047e0 and provide feedback by EOD this Friday? Specifically, we need confirmation on the feasibility of the proposed async callback endpoint on your side.\n2.  **Juspay Eng Team (Priya):** Please finalize the Kubernetes deployment plan for the new microservice in our staging environment and share the resource allocation estimates by Monday.\n3.  **ICICI Team (Anand):** We will require sandbox credentials for your `/v3/settlements/async_confirm` endpoint by next Wednesday to begin our integration testing.\n\nI think a quick 30-minute technical sync early next week would be beneficial to align on the final approach.

I’ve reviewed your notes from email 24a5059bf3a047e0 and our internal security team has completed their initial analysis. This is indeed a critical issue for the UPI Credit Line integration (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41), and we're treating it with the highest priority.\n\nThe finding, as I understand it, flags a violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 concerning the handling of sensitive data within the JWT tokens used in our OAuth 2.0 authorization flow. Specifically, our `/v2/creditline/authorize` endpoint was generating tokens that, while signed, contained partially unencrypted customer identifiers in the payload. These were subsequently being captured in our Kibana logs for debugging, which is an unacceptable risk.\n\nOur investigation confirms this. While transaction success rates remain stable at 99.6% and p99 latency is holding at ~450ms, this compliance gap needs immediate remediation. The issue has been formally logged under JIRA PAY-1389.\n\nHere is our immediate action plan:\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation (Done):** As of this morning, our SRE team has deployed an emergency logging filter across our Kubernetes cluster. This prevents the sensitive portion of the JWT payload from being indexed in Kibana. This is a temporary fix to stop the data leak.\n\n2.  **Permanent Fix (In Progress):** Our engineering team is currently refactoring the token generation service. The new approach, which aligns with the security patterns outlined in our internal spec (file#bf6e234e1ab14061), will remove sensitive data from the JWT payload entirely. Instead, we will pass a secure, opaque reference ID that our backend can use to look up the necessary information from our encrypted database. This should have a negligible impact on performance, and we are targeting a sub-50ms increase in processing time.\n\n**Action Item for ICICI Bank:**\n\nTo ensure a smooth transition, could you please have your technical team confirm that your settlement and reconciliation systems can correctly process a callback that contains this new reference ID format? We need to ensure there are no downstream dependencies on the specific fields within the current JWT payload. We anticipate the change will be on our end only, but we need your validation before we can proceed to UAT.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n*   **By EOD tomorrow:** We will provide you with the updated API specification for the modified callback.\n*   **End of this week:** Our fix will be deployed to the staging environment for internal testing.\n*   **Early next week:** We would like to schedule a joint UAT session with your team to validate the end-to-end flow. Please let us know your team's availability.\n\nTo be transparent, the timeline is aggressive, but we must resolve this PCI finding before the auditor's final report is submitted.

The data you pulled is quite concerning from a compliance and stability perspective.\n\nMy primary concern is the potential breach of our regulatory obligations and partner SLAs. Looking at the Grafana dashboard for our UPI gateway, the P99 latency on the `/payment/initiate` endpoint is spiking to over 2.5s during these failure windows. This directly impacts user experience and puts us at risk of violating the uptime requirements defined in our agreement with ICICI. The intermittent error rate of ~3.5% is also unacceptable for a live integration.\n\nFrom an audit perspective, we need to ensure our logging is robust enough for this scenario. The Kibana logs clearly show the `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` errors, but are we capturing the full request/response cycle for the failed token refresh attempts against their `/oauth/token` endpoint? For our upcoming SOC 2 and PCI DSS audits, we must be able to prove that every transaction state is accounted for and that no sensitive JWT payload is mishandled or left in an indeterminate state.\n\nI have updated JIRA PAY-2781 with these compliance-specific concerns. While your analysis points to a potential issue on ICICI's end, we need to confirm our own resilience. Can you please verify the following:\n\n1.  **Fault Tolerance:** Is our circuit breaker configured correctly in the Kubernetes deployment to prevent cascading failures if ICICI's auth service becomes completely unresponsive? We can't let this impact other payment flows.\n2.  **Reconciliation:** What is the current reconciliation status for transactions that failed during these timeouts? We need to ensure there is no settlement mismatch between our system and ICICI's.\n\nLet's formalize the next steps. I will draft a preliminary incident report based on the findings in file#bf6e234e1ab14061. In the meantime, we need to push ICICI for an official RCA and a timeline for a permanent fix.

After reviewing our Kibana logs (index: `payment-connector-*`), I can confirm that during specific error conditions—primarily when we receive a `401 Unauthorized` or `503 Service Unavailable` from ICICI's `/token` endpoint—our exception handler is dumping the full, unredacted API response. This is a direct violation of PCI DSS requirement 3.2 concerning the storage of sensitive authentication data.\n\nThe root cause lies in an overly permissive logging configuration within the `ICICITokenManager` class, which was likely intended for staging debug purposes and never sanitized for production. Our core performance metrics on the Grafana UPI dashboard are unaffected—P99 latency remains stable around 450ms and our transaction success rate is holding at 99.7%—but this compliance gap is obviously a showstopper and requires immediate remediation.\n\nI have initiated JIRA ticket PAY-1756 to track this, and here is the proposed remediation plan:\n\n1.  **Immediate Hotfix:** I've already developed a hotfix that introduces a redaction filter to the logging middleware. This filter will specifically target and mask the `access_token` and `refresh_token` fields in any logged payload before it's written to stdout. The change is isolated and has minimal performance overhead.\n\n2.  **Staging Deployment & Validation (ETA: Today, 5 PM IST):** The hotfix will be deployed to our staging environment. I will work with the QA team to simulate the `401` and `503` error scenarios against ICICI's UAT instance to guarantee the redaction logic is functioning correctly under load.\n\n3.  **Production Rollout (ETA: Tonight, post-2 AM IST maintenance window):** Pending successful validation and a quick sign-off from the security team, we'll execute a rolling update of the `upi-credit-line-connector` Kubernetes deployment in production. This will ensure zero downtime.\n\n4.  **Log Data Purge:** Post-deployment, we must purge the compromised historical log data from our Elasticsearch cluster. As per the data retention policy outlined in Doc#bf6e234e1ab14061, I will coordinate with the SRE team to initiate a targeted deletion script for the affected log entries from the last 7 days.\n\nCould you please confirm if this plan is sufficient to address the auditor's concerns? I will also need a sign-off from Sameer on the merge request for PAY-1756 by this afternoon to meet the timeline. I'll post an update on the staging validation by EOD.\n\nRegards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer"],"timestamp":1757912640000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["priya.sharma@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

The data confirms what we've been observing from a business and partner perspective regarding the UPI Credit Line integration with ICICI Bank.\n\nThe high false positive rate from the new fraud detection model is now a critical issue. Our Grafana dashboards show a sustained drop in the transaction success rate (TSR) from our 99.5% baseline to ~96% over the last 12 hours. Kibana logs are flooded with legitimate transactions being declined by our `/v2/transaction/authorize` endpoint, returning error code U69 (Transaction declined by issuing bank), which we've traced directly back to the new model's overly aggressive scoring.\n\nAs you highlighted in your analysis (ref: file#bf6e234e1ab14061), the model seems to be incorrectly flagging transactions with a specific combination of transaction value and MCC, leading to a false positive rate of approximately 3.5%, a massive jump from our usual 0.2%. This is not sustainable. ICICI Bank's risk team reached out this morning (building on their initial flag in email#4e0120fb81994f38) and they are, understandably, concerned about the customer experience and the integrity of the credit line offering. This is putting our T+1 settlement cycle at risk if disputes start piling up.\n\nWe need to treat this with the highest urgency. The associated JIRA ticket, PAY-1223, has been escalated.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Priya):** Please coordinate with the SRE team to initiate a rollback to the previous stable fraud model version (v2.3.1). We need this completed within the next 2-3 hours to mitigate further business impact. We can't afford to bleed more transactions.\n\n2.  **Data Science (attn: Ankit):** Can your team please isolate the problematic training data and begin retraining a hotfix version of the model?

Building on that, my team has conducted a deeper investigation into the UPI Credit Line settlement mismatch, and the issue is more critical than we initially thought.\n\nWe've identified a persistent discrepancy for a batch of transactions processed yesterday between approximately 14:30 and 15:15 IST. Our UPI gateway logs show around 1,250 transactions as definitively successful (receiving a final success confirmation from your end), but these are completely missing from the T+1 settlement file (Ref: file#bf6e234e1ab14061) we received this morning. This is for the integration under Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41.\n\nOur Grafana monitoring shows a significant P99 latency spike on your `/credit/process` endpoint during that specific window, jumping from a baseline of ~350ms to over 1.8s. While we did observe a correlated increase in `U30` (NPCI timeout) errors, the transactions in question were retried and eventually received a synchronous success response from your system. Our Kibana logs confirm the final status as `TXN_SUCCESS`, yet they haven't reconciled.\n\nThis points to a potential issue where the user-facing transaction succeeded and funds were likely blocked/debited, but a downstream failure in your internal settlement posting process prevented them from being included in the final batch file. As you know, this has serious implications for our accounting and our ability to meet RBI's regulatory reporting requirements for T+1 settlement.\n\nWe've raised a critical ticket, JIRA PAY-3099, to formally track this incident. The expected behavior, as documented in our initial spec discussions (ref: email#4e0120fb81994f38), is that the synchronous API response is the source of truth.\n\nTo resolve this urgently, we need the following from your team:\n\n1.  **Immediate Investigation:** Please analyze the attached sample of 50 transaction IDs and provide their terminal status from your core banking system, not just the gateway logs.\n2.  **Detailed Logs:** We require your server-side application and transaction logs for the 14:30 - 15:15 IST window. We need to see what happened post-authorization on your end.\n3.  **Root Cause Analysis:** Can you confirm if any deployments, configuration changes, or infrastructure issues occurred on your Kubernetes cluster or database during that period?\n\nWe need to get a clear picture by EOD today to proceed with manual reconciliation efforts and prevent customer-facing issues.

The log snippets from Kibana showing the `504 Gateway Timeout` on calls to ICICI's OAuth service were very clarifying.\n\nI'm growing increasingly concerned about the compliance implications of these recurring OAuth token refresh failures. As you highlighted, the issue is causing our `/creditline/v1/transaction` API calls to time out, with latencies spiking to over 2,500ms. Our Grafana dashboard for UPI Credit Lines shows the error rate hitting 3.5% during yesterday’s evening peak, which is a significant deviation from our sub-0.5% SLA for this integration.\n\nFrom a regulatory standpoint, this is becoming problematic. These failed states create ambiguous transaction records. If a transaction authorization call fails after user consent but before we receive a definitive response from the bank's system, we have a gap in our audit trail. This poses a direct risk to our SOC 2 compliance posture and could be flagged as a critical issue in our next RBI audit, particularly concerning the end-to-end integrity of transaction lifecycles.\n\nI’ve reviewed the sequence diagrams in file#bf6e234e1ab14061 and confirmed our service is correctly managing the JWT lifecycle and attempting the refresh well before expiry. The problem seems isolated to ICICI's `/oauth/token` endpoint's reliability. This isn't just a performance issue; it's a data integrity risk.\n\nCould you please escalate this with the ICICI technical team again today? We need a formal incident report from their side.\n\nHere are my immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Aditya:** Please collate a list of `trace-ids` from the last 12 hours for all failed token refresh attempts and attach them to JIRA ticket PAY-5337. This will provide concrete evidence for our escalation.\n2.  **Priya (self):** I will draft a formal communication to our relationship manager for ICICI, cc'ing their compliance head, detailing the service instability and the potential regulatory exposure.

Building on your initial alert from email a7837277d5cc4071, I've spent the last few hours investigating the latency spike in the real-time risk scoring engine for the ICICI UPI Credit Line integration (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41).\n\nHere’s a summary of my findings:\n\nOur Grafana dashboards confirm a significant degradation. The P99 latency for our internal `/credit/score` endpoint, which wraps the ICICI API call, spiked from a baseline of ~350ms to over 1800ms starting around 14:30 IST yesterday. This is well outside our SLA of 400ms. The transaction success rate has dipped by 0.8% as a direct result.\n\nAfter analyzing the request lifecycle, it's clear the bottleneck is not within our infrastructure. Our core UPI gateway and NPCI integration points are stable, with processing times holding steady at ~120ms. The Kubernetes pods for the risk engine service are healthy with no abnormal CPU or memory pressure. I've ruled out our Redis caching layer as well.\n\nDrilling down with Kibana, the issue points directly to the external API call to ICICI's risk scoring service. The TTFB (Time To First Byte) from their endpoint is extremely volatile. I am seeing delays of up to 1.5 seconds just on the OAuth 2.0 JWT token validation and handshake, before we even receive a payload. This is causing a chain reaction, leading to intermittent 504 Gateway Timeout errors for end-users, which I’ve documented in JIRA PAY-2762.\n\nThis level of latency is becoming critical. It not only compromises the user experience but also puts us at risk of non-compliance with RBI's stipulations on real-time transaction processing. The preliminary analysis in file#bf6e234e1ab14061 outlined these risks, and we are now seeing them manifest.\n\nAction Items & Next Steps:\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation (Done):** As a temporary measure, I have deployed a more aggressive client-side timeout of 2.5s. If the ICICI API fails to respond, our system will fall back to a predefined, conservative credit limit to prevent a complete transaction failure. This is a stop-gap and not sustainable.\n\n2.  **Escalation (Action: Aditya):** Aditya, could you please help escalate this with our technical counterparts at ICICI? I’ve tried reaching out based on our prior discussion (ref: email#4e0120fb81994f38), but I haven't received a technical RCA or acknowledgement of an issue on their end. We need their infrastructure team to investigate the performance of their authentication and risk scoring endpoints as a top priority.\n\n3.  **Monitoring:** I will continue to keep a close watch on the Grafana dashboards and have configured alerts to trigger if the error rate exceeds 1.5%. All relevant logs and performance graphs have been appended to JIRA PAY-2762 for a complete audit trail.\n\nWe need to get to the bottom of this quickly. Any support in pushing ICICI for a swift response would be greatly appreciated.\n\nBest regards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer"],"timestamp":1757913360000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","priya.kapoor@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Our Grafana dashboard for the `/upi/creditline/transact` endpoint is lit up, and Kibana logs show a surge in error code `F53` (Transaction Flagged as High-Risk) for legitimate-looking transactions, primarily in the INR 15,000-25,000 range. This is significantly above the 0.5% threshold we defined in our initial risk assessment (reference file#bf6e234e1ab14061).\n\nThis isn't just a technical metric; it's a direct hit to the user experience for a critical product launch. We can't afford to have genuine users blocked, especially in this early adoption phase.\n\nI've created JIRA PAY-3643 to track the immediate remediation. The priority here is to have the SRE team recalibrate the model's risk-scoring parameters. The current weighting seems overly sensitive to new device IDs combined with high-value transactions, which is a common pattern for early adopters and is flooding our system with false flags. We need to deploy a tuned model to the staging environment for regression testing by tomorrow, EOD. The goal is to bring the false positive rate back under 1% without compromising our SOC 2 and RBI compliance obligations for fraud monitoring.\n\nIn parallel, I will be reaching out to our primary contact at ICICI Bank, Anjali Mehta. I'll frame this as a proactive, collaborative effort to fine-tune the risk engine based on live traffic patterns, which is a standard procedure.

Since your core banking system migration last Tuesday, we're seeing a significant performance bottleneck that seems to be directly tied to the authorization flow. Our Grafana dashboards are showing a consistent degradation in P99 latency for calls to your `/creditline/v2/authorize` endpoint. Pre-migration, we were seeing healthy response times around 300-400ms. Post-migration, this has jumped to an average of 2.1s, with frequent spikes exceeding 2.5s.\n\nThis latency increase is also causing a rise in downstream transaction timeouts on our end. Our error rate for transactions involving ICICI credit lines has increased from ~0.2% to 1.8%, primarily due to `504 Gateway Timeout` errors. I've attached a snippet from our Kibana logs in file#bf6e234e1ab14061 which traces these delays directly back to the response from your servers. We suspect the new CBS is struggling with the lookup or validation logic tied to the OAuth 2.0 JWT token verification process.\n\nAs we discussed in our sync on Monday (ref: email 4e0120fb81994f38), maintaining performance post-migration is a critical gating factor for our production rollout, especially to remain compliant with NPCI's real-time processing guidelines. We've consolidated all our findings and are tracking this issue under JIRA PAY-1220.\n\nTo move forward, we have the following action items:\n\n1.  **ICICI Bank Team:** Please initiate an urgent investigation into the performance of the `/creditline/v2/authorize` endpoint. We need a root cause analysis of the latency increase post-CBS migration.\n2.  **ICICI Bank Team:** Can you please share the server-side performance logs from your application and CBS for the transaction samples provided in the attached log file?\n3.  **Juspay Team (Aditya Singh):** Continue to monitor our gateway metrics and prepare a comparative performance report against other issuing banks to ensure we've isolated all external factors.\n\nI am a bit concerned this bottleneck will impact our go-live timeline.

This is a direct and serious violation of PCI DSS requirement 3.3 (Mask PAN when displayed) and 3.4 (Render PAN unreadable anywhere it is stored).\n\nI’ve traced this back to the `/v1/creditline/auth` endpoint in our UPI gateway service. It appears that when the service is handling the OAuth 2.0 callback from ICICI and generating our internal JWT token, it is logging the entire request payload, which includes the full 16-digit PAN. Our Kibana log stream for the Kubernetes pods (`k8s-stream: upi-gateway-prod`) confirms this. The current log masking rules do not seem to be applied to this specific data structure.\n\nLooking at our Grafana dashboard, we are processing approximately 3,000-4,000 link-initiation requests per hour at peak, and this logging issue affects every single one. This is a significant data exposure event and will be an immediate blocker for receiving our Attestation of Compliance (AOC).\n\nI have created JIRA PAY-7638 to track this vulnerability and have attached the relevant log snippets and a reference to the specific finding from the auditor's report (Doc#702a8f38f40549b9). This behavior unfortunately contradicts the data handling specifications we laid out in the initial design document (file#bf6e234e1ab14061).\n\nWe need to action this immediately. Here are the required steps:\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation (Owner: Aditya):** A hotfix is required to correctly apply the PAN masking rule (first 6, last 4) to the `request.payload` field for the `/v1/creditline/auth` endpoint. This needs to be deployed to both staging and production environments with utmost urgency.\n\n2.  **Log Data Purge (Owner: SRE/DevOps):** We must initiate a procedure to securely purge this sensitive data from our Kibana/Elasticsearch cluster. I will work with the SRE team to define the exact query and scope for this cleanup.\n\n3.  **Root Cause Analysis (Owner: Aditya):** We need a quick RCA to determine why the existing log masking framework failed for this new flow and what safeguards we can add to our CI/CD pipeline to prevent recurrence.\n\nThe auditors have given us a firm deadline of EOD tomorrow to provide a detailed remediation plan and a timeline for the fix. I'm feeling the pressure on this one. Can you please confirm if you and your team can get a hotfix deployed to the staging environment for validation by tomorrow afternoon? \n\nPlease let me know if you need to set up a call to go over the log details.

I've investigated this as a priority, and I can confirm we have a configuration issue affecting the new UPI Credit Line integration with ICICI Bank.\n\nThe root cause appears to be a misconfiguration in our payment routing logic specifically for cross-border transactions under this program (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41). Digging into the Kibana logs for our `upi-gateway-v3` Kubernetes pods, I observed a significant increase in `ERR_ROUTING_MCC_MISMATCH` errors starting around 02:30 IST, immediately following our last config push. Our primary Grafana dashboard (Payments-Errors) shows the corresponding P99 latency for these transactions jumping to over 2500ms before timing out.\n\nEssentially, the new BIN ranges for ICICI's credit line were not correctly mapped to our international routing processor. Instead, they were being directed to a domestic-only channel, causing an immediate rejection from the NPCI switch. This has resulted in a failure rate of approximately 4.8% on all international transactions attempted via this specific credit line, impacting just over 15,000 payments so far. The OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token generation are working correctly; the failure is happening post-authentication at the routing layer.\n\nI have documented the full root cause analysis (RCA) and linked the relevant logs in JIRA PAY-5175. This issue also has implications for our T+1 settlement reconciliation, which will require manual intervention for the affected transaction batch. From a PCI DSS standpoint, no sensitive data was compromised, but the configuration drift is a process gap we need to address.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1.  **Immediate Action:** I have prepared a hotfix by updating the routing configuration map in our Consul KV store. This change correctly associates the ICICI BINs with the international acquiring service.\n2.  **Staging Validation:** I will deploy this fix to our staging environment within the next 30 minutes.\n3.  **Action for QA (Priya):** Could you please have your team ready to execute the regression test suite for cross-border payments on staging as soon as it's live? I'll ping you on Slack with the go-ahead.\n\nPending successful validation, I'm proposing an emergency production deployment tonight at 02:00 AM IST to mitigate further business impact.

The numbers confirm what we've been fearing.\n\nThe current rate limiting from ICICI Bank's end is becoming a critical bottleneck for the UPI Credit Line integration (Work ID: a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41). Our Grafana dashboards are showing a hard ceiling at 125 TPS on their `/v2/payments/initiate` endpoint, which we are consistently hitting during peak hours. This is causing our p99 latency to spike above 2.5s, leading to a transaction failure rate of ~3.5% due to `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors. This is a far cry from our target of sub-400ms latency and a <0.5% error rate.\n\nAs documented in JIRA PAY-5594, Kibana logs confirm these are not isolated incidents but a systemic throttling issue. Frankly, this is frustrating as it directly jeopardizes our launch timeline and the projected transaction volumes we committed to. This limitation was a potential risk we flagged during the initial architecture review (as noted in Doc#37970b233d9c44d2 and the benchmark analysis in file#bf6e234e1ab14061).\n\nI have escalated this with our relationship manager at ICICI Bank, referencing our previous communication (email#4e0120fb81994f38) and have formally requested an immediate quadrupling of our TPS quota to 500 TPS to provide necessary headroom.\n\nWhile I pursue the business escalation, could your team please investigate a tactical mitigation? Perhaps an intelligent queuing system with exponential backoff on our UPI gateway? This could help manage the bursts and reduce user-facing errors, though I'm mindful of the potential impact on settlement times. We need to ensure any such mechanism is fully compliant with NPCI's directives on transaction lifecycle and that our audit logs for SOC 2 compliance remain clean.\n\n**Action Items:**\n1.  **Rohit (Me):** I will follow up with ICICI Bank daily and provide an update by EOD.\n2.  **Priya:** Can you please evaluate the feasibility and engineering effort for the queuing mechanism and share an estimate by tomorrow afternoon?\n3.  **All:** Let's schedule a brief 15-minute sync for tomorrow at 10:00 AM IST to align on our strategy.\n\nWe need to resolve this quickly.

It helped our team correlate the failures we're observing.\n\nI’m writing to provide a more detailed analysis from our side regarding the ongoing KYC automation failures for the UPI Credit Line integration (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41). To be frank, this is becoming a critical blocker for the go-live, as the failure rates for high-risk customer segments are unacceptably high.\n\nOur engineering team has been analyzing our Kibana logs and Grafana metrics, and here's what we've found:\n\n1.  **Error Pattern:** We are consistently receiving `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors from your `/v2/customer/kyc-check` endpoint. This issue is isolated to customer profiles that our system flags as 'high-risk' based on the criteria in file#bf6e234e1ab14061. Standard KYC checks are processing normally with a P99 latency of ~320ms.\n\n2.  **Performance Metrics:** For the failing requests, our Grafana dashboard shows the API call latency spiking to over 2500ms before our client times out. This has driven the failure rate for this specific user segment to ~4.8% over the last 48 hours, a significant deviation from our target SLA of <0.5%.\n\n3.  **Authentication Flow:** The OAuth 2.0 handshake and JWT token generation are successful. We see a valid token exchange in the logs just before the call to the KYC endpoint, which suggests the issue is not with authentication but with the processing of the request on your end.\n\nOur leading hypothesis is that the downstream risk-scoring service within ICICI's infrastructure, which is likely invoked for these high-risk profiles, is either slow or timing out, preventing the API gateway from returning a response within the agreed-upon window. This issue is tracked under JIRA PAY-7030, where we have attached detailed logs and transaction samples.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, the growing queue for manual KYC verification is a concern. It puts pressure on our operational capacity and risks breaching the RBI's prescribed turnaround time for credit line activation, a key requirement we reviewed in Doc#1467e22ab8ef4a98.\n\n**Action Items for ICICI Bank Team:**\n\n*   Could you please investigate the performance of the internal service that handles risk assessment for the `/v2/customer/kyc-check` API? We need to understand the cause of the ~2.5s+ latency.\n*   Please provide us with your server-side application and NGINX logs corresponding to the transaction IDs listed in the Google Sheet linked within JIRA PAY-7030.\n\nGiven the urgency, I'd like to propose a 30-minute technical call tomorrow with your API engineering team to troubleshoot this.

I've spent the morning digging into this from a compliance perspective, and the situation with the KYC automation failures is more concerning than I initially thought.\n\nThis isn't just a technical glitch; it's a significant compliance gap. I'm seeing a consistent 17% failure rate for customers our internal risk engine flags as 'high-risk', which is starkly different from the sub-0.2% rate for standard onboarding. This directly impacts our ability to adhere to RBI's Master Direction on KYC, specifically the requirements for Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD). We're essentially unable to automatically onboard a critical segment, and the manual fallbacks are not a scalable or auditable long-term solution.\n\nLooking at the Kibana logs for the KYC-Orchestrator service, the calls to ICICI's `/v2/customer/verify` endpoint for these users are consistently returning a `422 Unprocessable Entity` with the custom error `ICICI-KYC-EDD-INCOMPLETE`. My hypothesis, building on your point about payload differences, is that we are not passing an expected additional data set required for their EDD process. The current OAuth 2.0 token scope might also be insufficient for the level of verification ICICI requires for these profiles. The integration spec (ref file#bf6e234e1ab14061) is a bit ambiguous on this point, which is worrying.\n\nThis has become my top priority. We cannot proceed with a wider rollout for this work (ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41) with such a critical compliance failure. The lack of a complete, automated audit trail for these transactions is a major red flag for any upcoming regulatory review.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n1.  **Aditya (Eng):** Can you please diff the request payloads between successful standard KYC calls and these failing high-risk ones? I need to know precisely which fields are missing or malformed. Let's track this under the existing JIRA ticket, PAY-5367.\n2.  **Priya (Compliance):** I am reaching out to our contacts at ICICI Bank's compliance division to get explicit, written clarification on the EDD data requirements for that specific API endpoint. I'll reference our conversation from last week (ref email#4e0120fb81994f38) to expedite this.\n\nI've blocked my calendar tomorrow afternoon for a sync to review your findings and my feedback from ICICI.

My investigation confirms that our core infrastructure is stable. The Kubernetes pods for the `kyc-automation-service` are healthy, and general KYC checks for standard profiles are processing normally with a p99 latency of ~450ms and an error rate below 0.2%.\n\nThe problem is specific to the \"high-risk\" customer segment. Looking at the Grafana dashboard I set up for this workflow, I'm seeing the failure rate for these specific transactions spike to nearly 15%. Digging into the Kibana logs for trace IDs associated with these failures, I’ve found a consistent pattern. Our service correctly obtains an OAuth 2.0 token and calls ICICI's `/v2/customer/ekyc/verify` endpoint. However, we are consistently receiving an `HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity` response with a specific error code: `E-4015`, accompanied by the message \"Invalid Risk Profile Data\".\n\nThis `E-4015` error code isn't documented in the API specification we received from them (file#bf6e234e1ab14061). This makes me suspect that the payload we're sending for this high-risk segment, which includes additional risk assessment fields as per RBI guidelines, is formatted in a way their system isn't expecting. This is a critical blocker and puts our compliance adherence at risk for this cohort.\n\nI've logged this officially under JIRA PAY-7039.\n\nCould you please escalate this to our technical counterparts at ICICI Bank ASAP? We need immediate clarification on two points:\n1.  The exact meaning of error code `E-4015`.\n2.  The required schema and data format for the payload when a customer is flagged as \"high-risk\".\n\nIn the meantime, I have configured an alert in our monitoring system to trigger if this error rate exceeds 10%, so we can track the impact closely. I'm also available to jump on a call with the ICICI team to debug this live by walking them through the exact request payloads we're sending.\n\nLet me know how you want to proceed.

Our Grafana dashboard shows that the P99 latency for the `/v2/risk/score` endpoint call to ICICI surged from our standard 280ms to sustained peaks of over 1.9s yesterday between 15:00 and 17:30 IST. This is pushing our end-to-end transaction time well over our internal 2.5s SLA and resulted in a transaction failure rate increase from 0.2% to 0.75%, which is unacceptable for a production service.\n\nOur internal diagnostics from Kibana logs confirm the delay is entirely external; our service wrapper, including JWT token generation via the OAuth 2.0 flow, is consistently responding in under 45ms. The issue appears to be squarely within the ICICI infrastructure post-authentication. This is all being tracked meticulously under JIRA PAY-1555.\n\nBuilding on your initial findings, and referencing the transaction patterns we documented in file#bf6e234e1ab14061, the latency seems to correlate with specific user segments, suggesting a complex rule in their scoring engine might be timing out or running an inefficient database query. This intermittent nature is making it difficult to pin down without their internal logs.\n\nFrom a business and compliance standpoint, we can't afford this level of performance degradation. It not only impacts customer experience but also puts us in a tricky position regarding the reliability commitments we've made, which are subject to RBI audit. \n\nAction Items:\n1.  **Aditya:** Can you please collate the trace IDs for the top 15 slowest transactions from the incident window?

The data strongly suggests the issue stems from the new fraud detection model deployed last Tuesday. Specifically, the false positive rate for transactions in the ₹5,000-₹15,000 range has spiked to 4.5%, a huge jump from our acceptable baseline of <0.7%. This is causing a direct drop in our overall GTV and is showing up as error code `FDP_03` (High-Risk Profile) on our side before we even attempt to process through the NPCI gateway.\n\nOur pre-auth risk assessment API is essentially timing out valid users. P99 latency on this check has increased to ~900ms, which is unacceptable. I’ve cross-referenced with the latest diagnostic logs from ICICI's UAT environment (ref: file#bf6e234e1ab14061) and can confirm they are not seeing these transaction attempts, isolating the problem to our pre-processing stage. While we must adhere to RBI's guidelines on digital lending and maintain SOC 2 compliance, this level of friction is creating a significant business impact.\n\nI’ve updated JIRA PAY-8876 with these findings. Here’s the plan:\n\n**Action Items:**\n1.  **For Engineering (Your Team):** Can we please prioritize testing a rollback of the latest risk ruleset in our staging environment? We need to confirm if this brings the false positive rate back to the baseline. We can't afford to push this through to production as is.\n2.  **My Action:** I'll reach out to our contact at ICICI Bank to give them a heads-up. I'll frame it as a 'proactive calibration of our risk engine to optimize success rates' without getting into the weeds on model specifics. This should manage expectations for the T+1 settlement reconciliation we discussed in email 4e0120fb81994f38, which might show slightly skewed numbers for a day or two.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n*   Let's schedule a 30-minute sync tomorrow with the Data Science team to review the model feature weights that are causing this. I suspect the 'new device' combined with 'high-velocity' checks are too aggressive.\n*   Pending successful staging validation, we should prepare for an emergency hotfix deployment by EOD Thursday.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on the staging rollback plan.

I've conducted an initial compliance review for the ICICI UPI Credit Line integration (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41) based on your findings, and there are a few points of concern.\n\nThe Grafana metrics you shared are indeed worrying. The p99 latency for the real-time risk scoring endpoint is peaking at over 1.9s, which is significantly above the 450ms threshold defined in our internal SLAs and the technical specifications outlined in file#bf6e234e1ab14061. My main concern is the direct impact on our regulatory standing. These delays could be interpreted as a failure in our mandated real-time fraud detection capabilities under RBI guidelines.\n\nI dug into the Kibana logs for the corresponding timeframe and noticed a troubling pattern: a 0.8% increase in transaction timeouts (Error Code: `RISK_EVAL_TIMEOUT`). This suggests we might be failing open on some transactions or, worse, failing the transaction entirely, impacting user experience. We need to quantify how many transactions were processed with degraded or bypassed risk scoring. A complete and accurate audit log is non-negotiable for our SOC 2 compliance, and these timeouts create potential gaps.\n\nAs you continue the root cause analysis, could you please confirm if the bottleneck is internal—perhaps related to JWT generation within our Kubernetes pods—or if it's on the ICICI Bank side after we make the API call?

This coincided with a transaction failure rate of 4.8%, almost entirely consisting of `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeouts`.\n\nI've traced the issue by analyzing the logs in Kibana using the correlation IDs from the failed transactions. Our internal infrastructure, including the K8s pods for the UPI gateway and our database connection pools, is performing well within expected parameters. Internal service-to-service calls are consistently below 60ms. The bottleneck appears to be external, occurring after our systems hand off the request to ICICI's API gateway.\n\nMy hypothesis is that this is directly related to ICICI's recent core banking system (CBS) migration. The transaction load we simulated (ramping up to 75 TPS) seems to be overwhelming their new backend. The OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token validation are succeeding with normal latency, which isolates the problem to their core transaction processing logic.\n\nI’ve documented these technical findings, including relevant log snippets and dashboard screenshots, in JIRA PAY-9143. This is a critical blocker for our go-live timeline and could present a compliance risk with RBI's transaction processing mandates if it persists.\n\nI believe we need to escalate this formally to the ICICI technical team immediately, referencing the performance benchmarks we had agreed upon in the initial spec (file#bf6e234e1ab14061).\n\nCould you please help set up an urgent joint-debugging session with their lead engineers?

Our engineering team has confirmed that during our load tests yesterday, we're consistently hitting a hard wall at approximately 100 TPS. We are seeing a high volume of `HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)` errors from the `/v2/upi/credit/initiate` endpoint. Our target for this phase, as outlined in our project plan (related analysis in file#bf6e234e1ab14061), is to sustain at least 500 TPS to simulate peak user load before we can sign off on performance validation.\n\nThe impact is quite significant. Our Grafana dashboards show our transaction success rate dropping from a healthy 99.5% to below 95% during these throttled periods. The p99 latency is also spiking from an average of 180ms to over 2.2s as our system attempts retries, which isn't a sustainable model for a live user-facing product and could breach the RBI's prescribed PSP App response time guidelines. I've attached a snippet from our Kibana logs to JIRA ticket PAY-2032 for your team's reference.\n\nOur infrastructure is built on a horizontally scaling Kubernetes cluster, so the limitation is not on our end. We need to ensure the end-to-end flow, including the OAuth 2.0 client credential grant and subsequent API calls using the JWT token, can handle the projected volume. A persistent throttling issue like this could jeopardize our ability to meet the T+1 settlement timelines and adhere to the uptime SLAs required by NPCI.\n\nCould you please get your team to review and increase the rate limits for our client ID to a minimum of 600 TPS?

The finding concerns the new UPI Credit Line integration with ICICI. Our initial investigation confirmed that unmasked PAN data is being logged in plaintext by our `upi-credit-orchestrator` service during specific failure scenarios in the VPA registration flow. This is a clear violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 and needs immediate action before we go live.\n\nRavi and Aditya have dug into this, and it seems the issue is triggered when we receive an `ICICI-REG-503` (Gateway Timeout) error from the bank's end. The current exception handler in the Hyper SDK seems to be dumping the entire raw request object to the logs for debugging, which unfortunately includes the sensitive payload. The Kibana dashboard linked in the JIRA ticket clearly shows the log entries. We need to decide on a fix that is both robust and auditable. Anjali, can you confirm if the operations team has any hard dependency on these verbose error logs for customer issue resolution?\n\nWe have two main paths forward: 1) Implement a broad data-masking filter at the service level, which might have a slight performance impact on p99 latency, or 2) A more surgical fix within the Hyper SDK's exception module to specifically nullify or mask the sensitive fields before logging. I believe the second approach is cleaner and directly addresses the root cause. My proposed action plan is:\n\n*   **Decision:** Proceed with the surgical fix in the Hyper SDK.\n*   **AI (Ravi):** Raise a PR with the updated exception handling logic. Please target EOD tomorrow so we can get it into the next staging deployment (ID: deploy-stg-20250715-b). ETA: 24 hours.\n*   **AI (Aditya):** Prepare the validation script. We need to explicitly test for this `ICICI-REG-503` case and verify that no PAN data is present in any log stream (Kibana, BigQuery). ETA: 2 days.\n*   **AI (Priya):** I will begin drafting the official response to the auditor, documenting the RCA and our remediation plan. This will be updated in the Confluence doc for this project. Draft will be shared by Friday for review.\n\nkeywords: PCI DSS, data leakage, PAN, log masking, Hyper SDK, PAY-6114","status":"confirmed","createdAt":1757919921466,"updatedAt":1757919921466,"app":"google-calendar","entity":"event","creator":{"displayName":"Priya Nair","email":"priya.nair@juspay.in"},"startTime":1757920560000,"endTime":1757924160000,"joiningLink":"https://meet.google.com/xyz-abcd-efg","permissions":["ravi.kumar@juspay.in","anjali.sharma@juspay.in","vikram.singh@icicibank.com","aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"]}},

The auditor has flagged a critical issue where truncated PAN data from the ICICI UPI Credit Line response payload is being written to our payment-gateway's debug logs. This appears to be a direct violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 regarding the protection of stored cardholder data. An initial check on our Kibana dashboard (link in Confluence) confirms this is happening for specific failure responses from the bank's end, particularly with error codes 'U81' (Invalid UPI PIN) and 'U89' (Transaction Failed at Bank).\n\nThe main agenda is to agree on a two-pronged remediation plan: immediate containment and a long-term fix. We can't afford to have this finding in our final report, so we need a concrete plan with timelines to present to the auditor by Friday. It looks like the logging logic was added to debug initial integration issues but was never removed from the production configuration for the error path. We need to confirm if any other error codes or flows are affected.\n\nHere are the proposed action items for discussion:\n1.  **Immediate Containment:** Rohan, can your team urgently modify the log shipper configuration (Filebeat) to filter out these specific log entries from being sent to Elasticsearch? I think this is our fastest way to stop the bleed. We need this done by EOD today.\n2.  **Permanent Fix:** The long-term solution should be to implement proper masking within the payment-gateway application itself, before the data even reaches the logging library. Let's scope out the effort for a hotfix and a more robust implementation in the next sprint (Sprint 24.12).\n3.  **Validation:** Anjali, once the immediate patch is live, can the security team perform a validation check to ensure no more PAN data is leaking into the logs? We'll need your sign-off for the auditor.\n4.  **Communication:** I will take the lead on drafting the official response to the auditor and keeping Sameer and the ICICI team updated on our remediation progress.

Following up on the Slack alerts, the Grafana dashboard 'UPI Transaction Health' is showing a significant spike in `ERROR_CODE: 7101 (Invalid_MCC_Country_Pair)` for transactions routed through the new `icici_upi_credit` flow. This started roughly 4 hours ago and seems to coincide with the rollout of the `ff_dynamic_routing_v2` feature flag. My primary concern here is the compliance implication under FEMA for mis-routing international payments, even if they are failing.\n\nInitial analysis from Rohan suggests the routing logic for specific Merchant Category Codes (MCCs), particularly for SG-based merchants, is not correctly configured in the payment-gateway service. The error rate for this route has jumped from <0.1% to 2.5%, impacting around ~150 transactions so far. We need to contain this immediately to prevent further impact and a potential breach of our processing agreement with ICICI. Vikram, I'd also like your input on the potential financial exposure, however small.\n\nProposed Agenda & Actions:\n1.  **Confirm Root Cause:** Rohan to walk us through his findings and confirm the link to the new feature flag.\n2.  **Immediate Mitigation:** Discuss the feasibility of a targeted hotfix vs. a full rollback of the feature flag. A hotfix seems preferable to avoid disrupting other services using the new routing logic. Rohan, can you come prepared with an estimate?\n3.  **Action Plan:** Assign clear owners and ETAs. My proposal:\n    - **Rohan (Eng):** Deploy hotfix to staging for validation. ETA: 2 hours post-meeting.\n    - **Anjali (PM):** Define the exact scope of impacted merchants/users and prepare a communication draft if needed.\n    - **Priya (Compliance) & Vikram (Risk):** Start drafting the internal incident report (PIR) for PAY-6985 and quantify the total transaction value affected using the BigQuery dataset `payments_production.transaction_logs_2024`.

Our `creditline-processor` microservice's `log4j2-transient.xml` configuration incorrectly retains logs containing device binding IDs and VPA aliases from failed `getCredential` API calls for up to 7 days, significantly exceeding the 15-minute maximum for such data in a non-CDE environment.","The root cause is an incorrect `maxHistory` attribute in the Log4j2 `RollingFileAppender`.

Our internal `Recon-Orchestrator` service has flagged these transactions with the `RECON_MISMATCH_STATUS_DIFF` error code. A deep dive into the logs shows that our `credit_line_payments` PostgreSQL table records these transactions with a final state of `TXN_TIMED_OUT`, originating from an NPCI response code `Z9`. However, the ICICI settlement file, processed by our parser service, lists them as `SUCCESSFUL`, causing the reconciliation break logged under JIRA ticket PAY-6451.","The root cause appears to be a race condition between our transaction status update consumer (reading from the `upi-credit-line-transactions` Kafka topic) and the bank's settlement generation window.

This late confirmation is not being propagated back to our `/upi/callback` endpoint, leading to the state divergence. Our Grafana dashboard `upi-credit-latency` confirms a P99 latency spike for issuer responses around 2:30 AM IST, correlating with the impacted transaction timestamps.","For immediate resolution, a manual patch will be executed to update the 27 transaction statuses in the production database, aligning them with the bank's settled data. As a preventative measure, I recommend modifying the `TxnStatusMapper` service to introduce a new intermediate state, `PENDING_RECONCILIATION`, for transactions marked with the `Z9` code.

Building on the initial metrics from the analysis in file 74325eeadc724d43, I've completed a preliminary investigation into the latency spike impacting the UPI Credit Line integration with ICICI Bank.\n\nThe incident occurred between 14:15 and 14:40 IST today. Our primary Grafana dashboard showed the P99 latency for the `/v2/risk/score` endpoint jumping from a baseline of ~150ms to a peak of 2.8s. This was quite concerning as it directly correlated with a rise in `504 Gateway Timeout` errors, pushing our overall transaction error rate from a nominal 0.1% to approximately 3.5% for the affected stream. At peak, this was affecting nearly 15k TPS.\n\nMy root cause analysis pointed away from the application layer. I dove into the Kibana logs for the `risk-scoring-service` Kubernetes pods, and the JWT validation and initial payload processing times were nominal. The bottleneck was identified at the data access layer. Metrics from our PostgreSQL monitoring dashboard indicated that the read replica for the user profile database was experiencing severe connection pool saturation. The `max_connections` limit was hit, and subsequent requests were queued, leading directly to the observed end-to-end latency.\n\nThis appears to be a direct consequence of the increased query volume from the new credit line eligibility checks we deployed last week for this project (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41).\n\n**Immediate Actions Taken:**\n\n1.  **Short-Term Mitigation:** I've vertically scaled the read-replica DB instance and increased the `max_connections` parameter from 200 to 400. \n2.  **Monitoring:** Latency has returned to the normal ~150ms range, and the error rate is back to baseline.

I need to escalate a critical finding related to the UPI Credit Line integration.\n\nOur internal security team, as part of the PCI DSS audit for this project (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41), has identified a high-priority compliance gap. The audit has flagged that the 'customerIdentifier' field, which contains sensitive pre-authenticated credit line data, is being logged in cleartext within your environment. We’ve tracked this under JIRA ticket PAY-5045.\n\nThis is a direct contravention of PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 (rendering PAN unreadable) and puts the go-live at serious risk. Our team has verified this by analyzing the transaction response logs from your UAT endpoints. While our UPI gateway correctly masks the data before it leaves our perimeter, the response payloads and subsequent error logs we are seeing from your side contain the unmasked identifier. I've attached a sample log snippet (ref: file#74325eeadc724d43) for your technical team's immediate review.\n\nThis is extremely time-sensitive as we need to provide a remediation plan to the auditors by this Friday. The current implementation, while stable from a performance standpoint (we are seeing P99 latencies around 210ms and an error rate of only 0.15% on the /creditline/authorize endpoint), cannot proceed with this vulnerability. As per our Grafana dashboards, the system is otherwise healthy, which makes this hidden compliance issue even more concerning.\n\nOur engineering lead, Prakash, suggests that the most direct solution is for your backend services to apply irreversible masking or truncation to this field *before* it is written to any log aggregator or file system.\n\nCould you please have your technical team confirm the following by EOD today:\n1. Acknowledge the source of the cleartext logging.\n2. Provide a concrete ETA for deploying a fix to the UAT environment.\n\nWe have a deployment window provisionally booked for Thursday to push any required changes on our end, but we are completely blocked until this is resolved.

Building on your points from email 2f5c4e48836f4152, our team has conducted a deeper investigation into the issue affecting the UPI Credit Line integration (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41).\n\nThe root cause appears to be an intermittent failure in the OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow. Our monitoring indicates that calls to your `/oauth/token` endpoint are periodically timing out, preventing our token management service from refreshing the JWT token before expiry. This subsequently causes a cascade of `401 Unauthorized` errors on our `/pre-auth` and other transactional API calls, as they are being sent with an expired token.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show a direct correlation between these refresh failures and a spike in API error rates, which jumped from a baseline of 0.15% to as high as 4.8% during peak hours yesterday. P99 latency is consequently exceeding 2500ms, a significant deviation from the 350ms SLA defined in our agreement. I’ve attached a log export from Kibana in file#74325eeadc724d43 which illustrates this pattern clearly.\n\nThis is becoming a critical blocker for our UAT phase, and the service degradation poses a risk to our ability to meet the uptime commitments outlined in the RBI guidelines for this product. Our internal incident ticket for this is JIRA PAY-8598.\n\nOur hypothesis is that your OAuth service might be experiencing resource contention or rate-limiting during high-volume periods (we're seeing bursts of up to 15K TPS across the platform). As a mitigation on our end, we are testing a more aggressive token caching strategy in our staging environment, but the fundamental issue with the refresh endpoint needs to be resolved.\n\nCould your team please prioritize an investigation into the performance of the `/oauth/token` endpoint? Specifically, can you check for any server-side errors, resource throttling, or unusual latency spikes corresponding to requests from our production IP range? We urgently need to get the error rate back under the 0.5% threshold.\n\nLet’s set up a quick 30-minute sync call for tomorrow with our lead engineer, Aditya Singh, to discuss your findings.

Building on your findings in email fa01f05a2d7446fb, I've done a deeper dive from a compliance and reconciliation standpoint, and the situation is a bit more concerning than I initially thought.\n\nI cross-referenced the transaction batch (Batch ID: IC_UPI_CL_20240904_B47) from yesterday's 18:00 IST cycle with our internal reconciliation system. The total mismatch stands at ₹87,342.50. The root cause appears to be what you highlighted: a state inconsistency between ICICI's synchronous `/getTxnStatus` API responses and the final settlement file (ref file#74325eeadc724d43) we receive at T+1.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, this is a significant issue. Specifically:\n\n1.  **RBI Compliance:** The lack of finality in transaction status directly contravenes RBI's guidelines on Turn Around Time (TAT) for failed transactions. We are logging these as 'Pending' based on API responses, but they are being settled as 'Success' by ICICI, creating a direct conflict in our audit trail.\n2.  **Data Integrity for Audits:** This discrepancy will be a major red flag for our upcoming SOC 2 Type II audit. Our control framework relies on the atomicity of transaction states reported via the API and the settlement feed. A persistent mismatch undermines the integrity of our financial reporting.\n3.  **Error Handling:** I’ve reviewed the Kibana logs for the corresponding timestamps. Our gateway is correctly flagging these transactions with an internal error code `J504_GW_TIMEOUT` when ICICI's API latency spikes above our 2.5s threshold. However, since the funds are eventually settled, it creates a manual and error-prone reconciliation process. This is the core issue tracked in JIRA PAY-9683.\n\nAs discussed in the earlier thread (email#ba493e18557a4cab), this has downstream implications. We need to be absolutely certain this isn't related to the JWT token refresh issues we observed last week, which could affect the authentication state of our API calls during peak load.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **Aditya (Eng Team):** Can you please provide a full dump of the request/response payloads for the transactions in that batch? We'll need this as evidence for our escalation to ICICI. Please attach it to PAY-9683.\n*   **Priya (Me):** I will draft a formal incident report for the ICICI Bank compliance team outlining the breach of SLA and the regulatory implications. I will reference Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41 and demand a root cause analysis (RCA) from their end.\n\nWe need to push ICICI for a concrete plan to ensure state consistency between their API endpoints and settlement reports.

Building on the performance degradation you highlighted in email dd3e8bea063f45b7, I've completed an initial investigation into the bottleneck with the UPI Credit Line integration (Work ID: a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41).\n\nThe findings are concerning. Our Grafana monitoring shows a severe degradation in API performance starting yesterday. Specifically, the P99 latency for calls to ICICI's `/credit/authorize` endpoint has spiked from a healthy baseline of ~450ms to over 2.2 seconds. This is well outside the performance envelope defined in our integration spec (ref: file#74325eeadc724d43).\n\nDrilling down with Kibana, the logs from our `upi-credit-line-svc` pods confirm the issue is external. Our internal request processing, including OAuth 2.0 token validation, is consistently under 120ms. The entire delta is added during the synchronous call to ICICI's backend. We're also seeing a corresponding error rate increase from 0.2% to a sustained 3.8%, primarily a mix of `504 Gateway Timeouts` on our side and ICICI’s proprietary `U34 - Host Unavailable` error code being returned.\n\nThis behavior pattern correlates directly with the timeline of ICICI's core banking system migration, which they notified us about in email ba493e18557a4cab. It seems their new system is not yet scaled to handle even our UAT load of 50 TPS, which is a fraction of the expected production volume. This level of instability is a major red flag and a blocker for go-live, as it jeopardizes our ability to meet the 99.95% uptime SLA and RBI's processing mandates.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Ticket Updated:** I have attached detailed log excerpts and Grafana dashboard snapshots to JIRA PAY-5552 for a complete record of the issue.\n2.  **Immediate Mitigation:** I have configured a temporary circuit breaker on our side to fail fast on these calls after a 2.5s timeout. This will prevent cascading failures in our systems but will still result in failed transactions for the user.\n3.  **ICICI Escalation:** We urgently need a formal Root Cause Analysis (RCA) from the ICICI technical team. We need to understand the architectural reason for this bottleneck and get a concrete timeline for resolution.\n\nAditya, can you please initiate an escalation and schedule an urgent joint-debugging session with our technical SPOCs at ICICI?

Building on that and our internal review, I want to detail our specific technical requirements to ensure we're aligned for the UPI Credit Line integration (Work ID: a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41).\n\nThe current T+1 settlement cycle for INR transactions works well, but as discussed, it's not viable for our cross-border merchant payouts which require dynamic forex conversion and reconciliation. To address this, we need a more robust, real-time mechanism.\n\nHere are our key technical requirements:\n\n1.  **Dedicated Settlement API Endpoint:** We propose a new REST API endpoint, for instance, `POST /v2/settlements/forex`, to handle these specific transactions. This endpoint must be distinct from the standard transaction status APIs. The request body would contain an array of transaction IDs ready for settlement, and the response should provide a detailed breakdown for each.\n\n2.  **Authentication & Security:** This new endpoint must be secured using the same OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow and signed JWT tokens we currently use for the payment initiation APIs. Consistency here is critical to avoid rework on our security layer. We cannot support a different auth mechanism for this flow.\n\n3.  **API Response Payload:** The response object for each transaction is crucial for our automated reconciliation system. It must include:\n    *   `juspay_txn_id`\n    *   `bank_ref_num`\n    *   `source_currency` (e.g., 'USD')\n    *   `settlement_currency` (e.g., 'INR')\n    *   `exchange_rate_applied` (to at least 4 decimal places)\n    *   `forex_conversion_fee`\n    *   `settlement_batch_id`\n    *   `settlement_timestamp` (ISO 8601 format)\n\nThe `settlement_batch_id` is particularly important, as it needs to correlate directly with the reconciliation files delivered via SFTP.\n\n4.  **Performance & SLAs:** While our standard transaction APIs operate with a P99 latency of <250ms, we understand settlement is a heavier process. We require a P99 latency of <1.5s for this new endpoint, with a target uptime SLA of 99.9%. Our Grafana dashboards are already configured to monitor these metrics, and we will need to add this new endpoint to our monitoring scope.\n\n5.  **Compliance and Reconciliation:** As you know, RBI's reporting guidelines on forex are stringent. The data from this API will be fed directly into our SOC 2 and RBI audit logs. We also require a daily consolidated settlement report (CSR) file to be dropped in our shared SFTP location, which must reconcile perfectly with the API responses. Any discrepancies here could trigger manual interventions, which we must avoid. The initial scoping document (file#74325eeadc724d43) has more details on the required report format.\n\nThis multi-currency capability is a major dependency for the project's next phase. We've tracked this requirement under JIRA PAY-9389, and I'm feeling a bit of pressure to provide our product team with a firm timeline. Could your technical team please review these requirements and provide feedback on feasibility and an ETA for having a sandboxed version of this API ready for our integration testing?

Building on the analysis from your email (9d76a4762e7e4b9f), I've done a deeper dive into the false positives we're seeing on the ICICI UPI Credit Line integration.\n\nThe situation is a bit more concerning than we initially thought. Our primary Grafana dashboard for this integration shows the false positive rate has spiked to 4.2% over the last 48 hours, a significant jump from our acceptable baseline of <0.5%. This is directly translating to a higher volume of transaction failures with the error code `U69` (Transaction declined by issuer), which is impacting user experience and our GTV for this crucial product launch under work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41.\n\nI've been reviewing the Kibana logs against the transaction IDs you shared in file#74325eeadc724d43. The pattern strongly suggests that the new risk-scoring parameters in our fraud detection model, deployed last Tuesday, are overly aggressive. Specifically, they seem too sensitive to transaction velocities from certain Tier-2 and Tier-3 city network blocks, which were not well-represented in the training data. The rejections are occurring post-authentication—after our `/v2/upi/credit/authorize` endpoint gets a success but before the request hits the NPCI gateway. The added latency from this check is now hovering around 180ms, up from 100ms.\n\nI’ve updated JIRA PAY-2082 with detailed logs and a root cause analysis summary. I also had a brief call with Rohan Verma's team at ICICI Bank. They've confirmed no changes on their end that would explain this behavior. I have asked them to re-verify the risk parameter guidelines they shared in email#ba493e18557a4cab, just in case there's a misinterpretation on how we've implemented their recommended thresholds.\n\nHere are the proposed action items:\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation (Owner: Aditya):** Can you please initiate a rollback of the fraud model to the previous stable version (v1.3.2) in our staging environment? We need to run A/B tests against production traffic replay to confirm this is the root cause.

This is a medium-term fix but we need to start immediately.\n\n3.  **Compliance Check (Owner: Priya):** Priya, could you please ensure all adjustments, including this temporary rollback, are documented for our audit trail? This is critical for our SOC 2 and RBI reporting obligations.\n\nI will set up a call for 10:00 AM IST tomorrow with our engineering leads and the ICICI risk team to align on a permanent fix.

Pinpointing the issue to the token expiry mismatch is a crucial step forward.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, I’m growing concerned about the downstream effects of these API timeouts. This directly impacts our ability to meet regulatory requirements for Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41. I've been reviewing the Kibana logs, and the volume of `HTTP 504` errors followed by `invalid_grant` responses from ICICI's `/oauth/token` endpoint is alarming. Our Grafana dashboard for the UPI Credit Line shows p99 latency for transaction initiation APIs spiking to over 2.2s, and the overall error rate has jumped from our baseline of 0.15% to nearly 4.8% during peak hours.\n\nMy primary concerns are:\n\n1.  **Audit Trail Integrity (SOC 2 & RBI):** The failed token refresh attempts are creating noise and potential gaps in our transaction logs. We need to ensure every failed attempt is logged with sufficient context for our upcoming SOC 2 Type II audit. Are we capturing the exact JWT payload that's being rejected?\n\n2.  **Transaction Finality:** These timeouts could leave transactions in an indeterminate state. This is a significant risk under RBI's guidelines on payment systems. We cannot have discrepancies between our ledger and ICICI's credit line utilization records. The current reconciliation process outlined in Doc#74325eeadc724d43 might not be robust enough to handle this failure scenario at scale.\n\n3.  **SLA Reporting:** This sustained error rate puts us at risk of breaching our 99.95% uptime SLA with partner merchants. We need to document this incident thoroughly for reporting purposes.\n\nI’ve updated JIRA ticket PAY-1258 to include specific sub-tasks for compliance validation of the eventual fix. Before deploying to production, can you please confirm that the fix will be pushed to the staging environment for a full regression test?

Our monitoring dashboards in Grafana show a clear correlation: just before the spike in p99 latency (from a baseline of 220ms to over 2.5s), we see a surge of `401 Unauthorized` responses from their `/token` endpoint. This is causing a cascading failure in our `upi-creditline-gw` service, as subsequent API calls for transaction processing are failing authentication, leading to the `504 Gateway Timeout` errors you observed.\n\nDigging into the Kibana logs, we're seeing `Invalid grant` errors when our system attempts to use the refresh token. This typically happens when the refresh token itself has expired or been revoked. Given the intermittent nature, it feels less like a complete revocation and more like a race condition or a configuration mismatch on token TTL (Time To Live). The error rate peaked at 4.8% during the incident, which is well above our 0.5% SLA threshold.\n\nAs a temporary mitigation, I've adjusted the proactive refresh buffer in our credential management service. We were previously refreshing 5 minutes before the JWT `exp` claim; I've now pushed that to 15 minutes. This has brought the error rate back down to ~0.3% for the last hour, but it's a workaround, not a solution. It's masking the underlying problem and is putting a bit of extra load on our credential manager and their auth server. All technical details of this investigation are documented in `file#74325eeadc724d43`.\n\nThis is becoming a bit frustrating as it's the second time we've faced this, building on the issue we discussed in `email#ba493e18557a4cab`.

This is resulting in a high volume of `T09` (Transaction Not Permitted) response codes from NPCI, with an average failed transaction latency of around 350ms.\n\nThe business and compliance implications here are serious. Aside from the immediate impact on user experience and our SLA (we're currently violating the 99.9% uptime clause), this misrouting could cause significant issues with our RBI reporting for cross-border transactions. This is exactly the kind of thing that attracts regulatory scrutiny.\n\nI’ve updated the primary ticket, JIRA PAY-6573, with log snippets and dashboard links. My initial analysis points to a rules engine update that was pushed to production two nights ago. Looking back at the change logs and the project spec in `file#74325eeadc724d43`, this specific routing logic doesn't seem to have been part of the planned scope, which is another point of concern we need to address.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Immediate Rollback:** We need the SRE team to initiate an emergency rollback of the routing configuration that went live. This needs to be treated as a P0 incident. Can you please get this prioritized immediately?\n\n2.  **Root Cause Analysis:** Once the system is stable, we must conduct a full RCA. We need to understand why our pre-deployment validation in the staging environment didn't catch this BIN-specific misconfiguration.\n\n3.  **Client Communication:** I will need to provide a preliminary incident report to our counterparts at ICICI Bank by EOD. It's crucial that I can assure them a fix is deployed and the issue is contained.\n\nThis is becoming a bit of a fire drill, and we need to get ahead of it before it escalates further with the bank. I've also referenced our prior email exchange on a similar topic (email#ba493e18557a4cab) to ensure we aren't repeating past mistakes.\n\nLet’s connect for 15 minutes once the rollback is complete. I need a clear technical summary for the client-facing RFO.\n\nBest,\n\nRohit"],"timestamp":1757913600000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

While we understand the model was configured with a conservative initial rule set as a precaution, the real-world impact is proving to be a significant challenge for us.\n\nWe are seeing an alarmingly high rate of false positives from the fraud detection model for the UPI Credit Line integration (Work ID: a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41). Our Grafana dashboard 'UPI-Credit-Line-Performance' shows that the transaction decline rate due to `TXN_FRAUD_BLOCKED` is hovering around 4.5% over the last 24 hours. This is well above our acceptable threshold of 0.5% and is severely impacting user experience and adoption.\n\nAnanya from our risk team has analyzed a sample set of these blocked transactions using Kibana queries (details attached in `file#74325eeadc724d43`), and the findings are quite concerning. Many of these are legitimate transactions from established users attempting their first credit line transaction, which seems to be a pattern the model is incorrectly penalizing. The risk scores returned by the `/v1/fraud/assess` endpoint for these users are disproportionately high. While API latency is stable at ~250ms, the decisioning logic itself appears to be the bottleneck.\n\nThis issue is now our highest priority, as it puts our user adoption targets at risk and is creating a poor first impression for this critical feature. We are tracking all related tasks internally under JIRA ticket PAY-6746. Given the volume, we are a bit worried about staying within RBI's guidelines on customer grievance TATs if this continues.\n\nTo move forward swiftly, could you please initiate the following actions from your side?\n\n1.  **Immediate review of the fraud model's feature weights:** We urgently need your team to analyze the specific rules that are contributing to this spike in false positives and recalibrate them. Can we get an ETA for this review?\n2.  **Provide more granular decline reason codes:** Currently, the API returns a generic `FRAUD_RISK_HIGH`. Receiving more specific reason codes (e.g., `NEW_USER_HIGH_TXN_VELOCITY`, `GEO_MISMATCH_RISK`) would be invaluable for our internal analysis and would help us provide better feedback for tuning.\n\nI think a quick 30-minute call tomorrow would be beneficial to align on a concrete action plan. Please let me know what time works for you and your team.\n\nWe need to get this decline rate down to under 1% by the end of this week.

Building on your analysis in email 690b26905545494e, I've investigated the compliance implications of the KYC automation failures we're seeing with the ICICI Bank UPI Credit Line integration (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41).\n\nThe situation is quite concerning from a regulatory standpoint. Our monitoring on Grafana shows that ICICI's KYC validation endpoint is failing for approximately 14% of customers categorized as 'high-risk' by our internal fraud detection engine. Kibana logs confirm that their API is returning a persistent `KYC_005: High-Risk Profile Manual Review Required` error, which forces these applications into a manual review queue.\n\nThis directly impacts our ability to adhere to RBI's stipulated timelines for digital onboarding and introduces a significant operational overhead that jeopardizes the scalability of this credit line product. A 14% manual fallback rate is simply not viable and presents a material risk for our upcoming SOC 2 and RBI audits. I have documented this as a high-priority issue in JIRA PAY-7459.\n\nMy primary concern, based on the risk matrix in file#74325eeadc724d43 and our previous discussion in email#ba493e18557a4cab, is that there's a fundamental misalignment between our risk scoring model and ICICI's. We are sending payloads that are 100% compliant with the agreed-upon API schema, but their system appears to be applying an additional, undocumented layer of risk assessment. This lack of transparency is the core of the problem.\n\nTo resolve this, I have the following action items:\n\n1.  **Aditya Singh:** Can you please coordinate with ICICI's technical team to obtain the full server-side logs for a sample of failed transaction IDs? We need to understand precisely which data points in our request payload are triggering their high-risk classification.\n\n2.  **Rahul Verma:** We need to escalate this formally with our counterparts at ICICI. We require an urgent technical deep-dive session with their API architects to get full transparency into their risk engine's decision-making logic. The current situation is a blocker for our planned UAT expansion.\n\n3.  **My Action:** I will update our internal compliance and risk assessment documents to reflect this gap and the temporary mitigation (manual review). However, I need to be clear that this is a stop-gap measure and not a sustainable long-term solution.\n\nLet's connect tomorrow morning to align on our consolidated communication to ICICI.

Regarding the high false positive rate you highlighted in email c9846899029243b6, I've completed an initial investigation and the numbers are indeed concerning.\n\nOur Grafana monitoring for the ICICI UPI Credit Line service shows the false positive rate spiked to 4.5% over the past 12 hours, far exceeding our 1% target threshold. This has directly impacted the transaction success rate, dropping it from our goal of 99.5% to approximately 95%. This is a critical issue for the success of this integration (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e-d80d0-51d413fa4b41).\n\nI've been digging through the Kibana logs from our `fraud-detection-service` Kubernetes pods and have isolated the root cause. A high volume of transactions are being flagged with risk score > 0.9 and reason code `FRD78-HIGH_VELOCITY_UNUSUAL_GEO`. My assessment is that the model's feature set for geolocation and transaction velocity is not well-calibrated for the credit line user profile, which exhibits different spending patterns compared to standard UPI P2M. The subsequent transaction declines from ICICI's `/debit` API are mostly `U69 - Transaction not permitted`, which is the expected response when we preemptively block a transaction based on our internal fraud score.\n\nI've created JIRA PAY-6476 to track this and have outlined a two-pronged approach:\n\n1.  **Immediate Mitigation:** I am proposing a temporary adjustment of the model's primary threshold for the `FRD78` rule from 0.90 to 0.96. This is a bit of a blunt instrument, but it should bring the success rate back into an acceptable range while we work on a permanent fix. I can deploy this via a configuration change in our Kubernetes ConfigMap without a full deployment cycle and will validate in staging first.\n\n2.  **Long-Term Solution:** The data science team needs to retrain the model. I've already shared a relevant log dataset from the last 24 hours with them, focusing on the incorrectly flagged transactions. We need to prioritize this to avoid compromising both user experience and our compliance with RBI guidelines on transaction success rates.\n\nBuilding on the analysis from email#ba493e18557a4cab and the architecture outlined in Doc#376959ca4344497e, I am also scheduling a call with the ICICI Bank technical team for tomorrow to review our pre-authentication (`/preAuth`) data exchange. There might be an opportunity to pass additional risk signals to them to refine their checks.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any immediate concerns with this plan.

Building on the details from your message (email 376959ca4344497e), our engineering team has conducted a deeper investigation into the intermittent API timeouts we're seeing in the UAT environment.\n\nWe've confirmed that the root cause is tied to the OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow. Our Grafana monitoring shows a direct correlation between P99 latency spikes on your `/oauth/token` endpoint and a subsequent cascade of HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout errors for our payment initiation calls. The latency on the token endpoint is jumping from an acceptable baseline of ~300ms to over 2.5 seconds, which exceeds our client-side timeout thresholds.\n\nThis is creating a significant impact. We're observing a transaction success rate drop of approximately 3.5% during these failure windows. As you can imagine, this is a critical blocker for our go-live and puts our joint commitment to a 99.95% uptime SLA at risk. The issue is being tracked internally under JIRA PAY-7628 for full visibility.\n\nAditya Singh, from our SRE team, has analyzed the Kibana logs from our Kubernetes pods. The logs indicate that our UPI gateway services are failing to receive a new JWT token from your endpoint before the connection times out. This appears to be more frequent during periods of moderate load, which makes us suspect a potential performance bottleneck or a rate-limiting policy on your end that gets triggered as our services scale. The full log analysis is attached in file#74325eeadc724d43, which builds on the earlier summary from email#ba493e18557a4cab.\n\nWhile we are exploring temporary client-side mitigations like implementing a more aggressive caching strategy for the JWT and a circuit breaker, the fundamental issue with the token endpoint's performance needs to be addressed at the source to ensure system stability.\n\nTo move forward, could your technical team please prioritize the following actions:\n\n1.  **Investigate the performance of the `/oauth/token` endpoint** under concurrent request load, focusing on the timestamps provided in PAY-7628.\n2.  **Review any server-side errors or resource constraints** (CPU, DB connections) on your authentication servers that align with these incidents.\n3.  **Confirm if any network or application-level rate limiters** are impacting our registered IP addresses from the Juspay production environment.\n\nWe need to resolve this urgently to keep the project timeline for work a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41 intact.

Building on your analysis in email 4b5f1ecb45ff4023, I’ve spent the morning investigating the KYC automation failures for the ICICI Bank UPI Credit Line integration.\n\nThis is becoming a critical blocker for Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41, and I'm concerned about our go-live timeline. Here’s a summary of my findings:\n\n**1. Issue Confirmation & Scope:**\nThe issue is isolated to customer segments that ICICI's internal risk engine flags as 'high-risk'. Our Grafana dashboard (Payments-Errors-UAT) shows a consistent failure rate of ~35% for this specific cohort when our KycService attempts to call ICICI's `/prequal/v2/initiateKyc` endpoint in the staging environment. This is a massive deviation from the baseline success rate of 99.5% for all other segments.\n\n**2. Technical Root Cause Analysis:**\nI've examined the Kibana logs for the failing transactions (trace IDs are now attached to JIRA PAY-3850). We are consistently receiving a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response with a custom error code `KYC_PROFILE_MISMATCH_HIGH_RISK`. The request payloads we're sending appear to be perfectly compliant with the API specification outlined in `file#74325eeadc724d43`.\n\nMy primary hypothesis is that this isn't a technical bug in our payload construction. Instead, it seems to be a business logic gate on ICICI's side. As we noted in the initial architecture discussion (ref: email ba493e18557a4cab), their system might require an additional data point or a manual review step for these profiles, but their API is defaulting to a hard failure instead of providing a fallback response code that would allow us to trigger a V-KYC flow.\n\n**3. Compliance Implications:**\nThe lack of a clear fallback mechanism poses a potential compliance risk. RBI guidelines on digital lending require a robust and auditable process for customer onboarding. A 35% silent failure rate for a specific segment could be flagged during an audit. We need to ensure our system can gracefully handle these exceptions per SOC 2 requirements.\n\n**Action Items & Next Steps:**\n\n*   **ICICI Bank Escalation (Owner: Siddharth):** I am drafting a formal communication to our counterparts at ICICI, referencing this data. I will request an urgent technical call to get clarification on the `KYC_PROFILE_MISMATCH_HIGH_RISK` error. We need to know the exact data mismatch or the required next step (e.g., a different endpoint, a specific flag in the request, or a redirect URL for manual intervention).\n\n*   **Internal Sanity Check (Owner: Aditya):** Just to be thorough, could you please review our OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token generation for these requests? Let's ensure no specific scope required for high-risk profiles is being missed. The token management spec is available in our Confluence doc.\n\n*   **JIRA Ticket Update (Completed):** I have updated PAY-3850 with all relevant logs, Grafana snapshots, and a link to this email thread for comprehensive tracking.\n\nThis is a frustrating roadblock, but one we need to resolve quickly. I'll push ICICI for a concrete response and a solution path by the end of this week.

I've taken a look at the Grafana dashboard you shared, and I concur with your findings. The p99 latency for the `credit-line/v1/authorize` endpoint is spiking to over 2.5s, a huge jump from our baseline of ~350ms, with error rates hitting 4.5% during peak load tests.\n\nYour diagnosis pointing to an OAuth 2.0 token refresh failure seems spot-on. Digging into the Kibana logs, I can see a pattern of `401 Unauthorized` responses from ICICI's auth server just before our services start throwing timeout exceptions. This clearly indicates our JWTs are expiring and the refresh flow is failing, which is a critical issue for this integration (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41).\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this raises a significant concern. My primary worry is the integrity of the audit trail. We need to ensure that every one of these failed authorization attempts is logged correctly with the appropriate error codes and metadata for our regulatory reporting obligations under RBI guidelines. A silent failure or an incorrectly logged transaction could create a major gap for our upcoming SOC 2 audit. As you know, demonstrating end-to-end transaction traceability is non-negotiable.\n\nI've updated JIRA PAY-9422 to reflect these compliance risks and linked it back to this thread. While the infrastructure team investigates the root cause—be it a misconfiguration in our Kubernetes deployment's egress rules or a potential rate-limiting issue on ICICI's end—could you please double-check that our application's exception handling is robust enough to capture these specific failure modes?

Building on the analysis from your email (279b3303e59344db), I've been investigating the settlement mismatch for our UPI Credit Line integration with ICICI Bank (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41).\n\nThe core issue, tracked under JIRA PAY-5758, is a persistent discrepancy between our transaction success logs and the daily NTSL settlement file we receive from ICICI. The mismatch rate is currently at ~0.15% on a daily volume of ~50,000 credit line transactions. This is unfortunately above our acceptable threshold of 0.05% and is starting to become a material concern for our finance operations team.\n\nMy investigation so far:\n\n1.  **Log Analysis:** I've gone through the Kibana logs for our `settlement-reco-service` (Kubernetes cluster `payments-prod-gcp-1`). The primary pattern involves transactions that our system correctly marks as 'Success' (based on a real-time NPCI response code '00') but are either completely missing from ICICI's T+1 settlement file or are marked with a different status code.\n\n2.  **Data Cross-Reference:** I've attached an updated version of the mismatch report (building on `file#74325eeadc724d43`) with ~75 RRNs from yesterday's batch that exhibit this behavior. For these transactions, our system shows a p99 response latency of ~280ms, which is well within our SLA and suggests no timeout issues on our side.\n\n3.  **Hypothesis:** My current theory is that there's a slight timing misalignment with ICICI's settlement file generation logic. It seems transactions that receive a late success confirmation from the NPCI network, possibly after ICICI's EOD cutoff, are not being included in the T+1 file as expected per the spec in `Doc#5d620ee2ca054818`. This is causing a reconciliation break that requires manual intervention and poses a risk for our SOC 2 compliance audits.\n\nOur Grafana dashboard (`upi-creditline-reco-dashboard`) visualizes this clearly, showing a spike in the `unreconciled_transactions_value` metric every day around 04:00 AM IST after we ingest and process their file.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **For ICICI Team (cc'd):** Could you please have your technical team investigate the sample RRNs provided? It would be extremely helpful if you could confirm the exact cutoff time (IST) for your T+1 settlement file generation and clarify the process for handling transactions that are confirmed post-cutoff. Are they rolled into a T+2 file?\n\n*   **For Me (Arjun):** I will deploy a patch to our `settlement-reco-service` in staging by EOD to add more granular logging. This will capture the full request/response payload from our async status check calls to the ICICI `/fetchTransactionStatus` API for these edge cases.\n\n*   **For Priya/Aditya:** Let's keep a close watch on PAY-5758. If the mismatch value continues to grow, we may need to escalate this with our account manager at ICICI.\n\nLet's plan to connect tomorrow afternoon to discuss findings.

We are consistently hitting a hard throttle on your API endpoints. Specifically, our calls to the `/creditline/v2/payment/authorize` endpoint are failing with `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` as soon as we cross a threshold of approximately 150 Transactions Per Second (TPS).\n\nThis is a significant blocker. As per our signed SOW (ref file#74325eeadc724d43), the system must support a minimum of 500 TPS to handle our projected launch volume. Our Grafana dashboards show the error rate spiking to over 15% during these load tests, while our internal SLA mandates an error rate below 0.5%. The Kibana logs for our Kubernetes pods clearly trace these 429 responses directly back to your gateway, ruling out any issues with our egress traffic or NPCI network latency.\n\nInterestingly, the p99 latency for successful transactions remains healthy at ~240ms, which is excellent. However, the high failure rate due to the current rate limit makes the service unviable for a production launch. This issue is our highest priority and is being tracked internally as JIRA PAY-2270.\n\nTo move forward, we need to have these TPS limits adjusted on your end. Could you please check the throttling policy applied to our OAuth 2.0 client credentials? We need to understand if this is a configuration oversight or a hard limit that requires a more formal capacity planning discussion.\n\nI would like to propose a joint technical call this week with your API infrastructure team and our payment gateway engineers.

Building on your findings in email 10bb181468da4ac9, I've done a deeper dive into the latency spike on the UPI Credit Line integration with ICICI Bank.\n\nThe situation is a bit more concerning than I initially thought. I've correlated our Kibana logs with the Grafana metrics for the period between 11:00 AM and 1:30 PM IST. We observed the P99 response time for ICICI's real-time risk scoring endpoint (`/api/v3/creditline/riskscore`) climb from a stable baseline of ~250ms to sustained peaks of over 2.1 seconds. This is a significant deviation and breaches the 500ms SLA defined in our technical integration document (Doc#e36928e0cc1240a8).\n\nOur internal service metrics from the Kubernetes deployment show that the request processing time on our side remains well under 50ms. The latency appears to be introduced entirely on the vendor side, specifically during the JWT validation phase before the risk assessment logic is even executed. This is causing a cascading effect, with our upstream services experiencing connection timeouts and a noticeable drop in the transaction success rate by about 2.8%. This is unacceptable for a critical T+0 settlement flow.\n\nI’ve escalated this with our primary technical contact at ICICI, referencing this incident under our shared Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41. I provided them with a sample of trace IDs from our logs and the analysis summary from file#74325eeadc724d43, asking for an immediate investigation into their OAuth 2.0 authorization server performance. This feels eerily similar to the incident we tracked in email thread ba493e18557a4cab last quarter.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Siddharth (Owner):** I will follow up with ICICI's team for a preliminary RCA by tomorrow, 12:00 PM IST. I have stressed that this impacts our ability to adhere to RBI's guidelines on timely credit provisioning.\n2.  **Infra Team:** Can someone please adjust the alerting thresholds on our Grafana dashboard for this specific endpoint? An alert should trigger if P99 latency exceeds 600ms for more than 3 consecutive minutes.\n\nI've linked this entire thread to JIRA PAY-5424 for formal tracking. I'm hoping for a quick resolution and will update everyone as soon as I hear back from the vendor.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiddharth Nair"],"timestamp":1757915400000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh@juspay.in","meera.desai@juspay.in","infra.alerts@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on your analysis in email e36928e0cc1240a8, this OAuth token refresh failure is a significant concern from a compliance and regulatory standpoint for the UPI Credit Line project (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41).\n\nI’ve been reviewing the Kibana logs and the pattern is concerning. Our UPI gateway services are consistently receiving HTTP 401 Unauthorized responses when trying to use expired JWTs against ICICI's /credit-line/authorize endpoint. This is then cascading into J504 Gateway Timeouts on our end as the system retries. The Grafana metrics confirm this, with P99 latency spiking from our ~250ms baseline to over 2.5 seconds, and the error rate jumping to 4.8%—far exceeding our 0.5% internal SLA threshold.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, this is a critical issue. An unstable authentication mechanism is a major red flag for any PCI DSS or SOC 2 audit. The intermittent timeouts compromise the integrity of our transaction audit trails, which is a direct violation of RBI guidelines for payment systems. We cannot have gaps in our logging, especially for a new credit product.\n\nThe issue, as tracked in JIRA PAY-1503, appears to stem from a failure in the client_credentials grant flow during token refresh. It seems our reactive approach—refreshing the token only after receiving a 401—is not robust enough, especially if ICICI's refresh token endpoint itself is latent. This isn't just a performance bottleneck; it's a fundamental control weakness.\n\nCould we explore a more proactive token management strategy? For example, refreshing the JWT token when it reaches 80% of its lifespan, rather than waiting for it to expire and fail. This would mitigate the risk of timeouts entirely. Also, has the infra team validated that there are no firewall or network ACL issues between our Kubernetes pods and ICICI's UAT IP range? This intermittent behavior feels like it could have a network component, not just an application logic one.\n\nI have appended my compliance risk assessment to JIRA PAY-1503. We need a stable authentication flow in UAT before we can provide compliance sign-off for this integration. Let's please prioritize a fix this week.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPriya"],"timestamp":1757915580000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"priya.nair@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","rohan.verma@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on the analysis from your email (d1901da1f17c4edb), I've completed the initial RCA for the cross-border payment failures on the UPI Credit Line integration.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe root cause is a configuration error within our `payment-router-service`. It appears a recent update incorrectly mapped a specific set of international card BINs to our domestic processing gateway, instead of routing them to the designated ICICI Bank cross-border endpoint. This is causing an immediate rejection with a `GW_ROUTE_ERR_5101` error code.\n\n**Technical Details & Impact:**\nI've traced the issue through our Kibana logs and can confirm it's isolated to our internal routing logic. The OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token management with the ICICI APIs are functioning correctly for all other traffic, which helped narrow down the search.\n\n*   **Impacted Volume:** We observed a transaction failure rate spiking to ~4.5% for the affected BIN ranges, primarily between 10:45 AM and 1:00 PM IST.\n*   **Performance Metrics:** Our Grafana dashboards show the P99 latency for these failed attempts is low (~250ms), as they are being rejected quickly by our gateway. While our overall uptime SLA remains at 99.98%, the success rate for this specific international user cohort is effectively 0%.\n*   **Compliance:** This is a routing logic error and does not violate PCI DSS as no sensitive cardholder data was exposed. I have verified that our audit logs for these failed transactions are correctly managed as per SOC 2 requirements.\n\n**Resolution & Next Steps:**\nI have developed and tested a hotfix that corrects the BIN routing table.\n\n1.  **Staging Validation:** The patch is deployed in our staging environment. Using the sample transaction IDs from `file#74325eeadc724d43`, we are now seeing 100% success. The P99 latency is holding steady at ~450ms, which is within the acceptable range for the ICICI cross-border leg.\n2.  **Production Deployment:** We are ready to deploy this, but I'm a bit concerned about the timeline. We need an expedited review from the security team before we can push this through the CI/CD pipeline for a rolling update to the production Kubernetes cluster.\n\n**Action Items:**\n*   **Priya:** Could you please help us get a priority review for the changes tied to JIRA ticket PAY-7363? We need to get this deployed before the evening peak traffic begins.\n*   **Ramesh (ICICI):** This is for your awareness. No action is required from your side at this moment. We will closely monitor the T+1 settlement reconciliation files post-deployment to ensure there's no downstream impact.\n*   **Arjun (Self):** I will personally monitor the `payment-router-service` Grafana dashboard post-deployment and have configured specific alerts for the `GW_ROUTE_ERR_5101` code.\n\nAll technical documentation is being updated in Confluence and linked to PAY-7363.

The data points directly to the latency spike in the real-time risk scoring engine for our UPI Credit Line integration with ICICI Bank, and I share your concern about its potential impact on user experience and our launch targets.\n\nDigging deeper into our monitoring, the Grafana dashboard (UPI-Credit-Line-Prod) confirms that the p99 latency for transactions involving risk scoring jumped from our baseline of ~250ms to peaks of 1.5s yesterday between 16:45 and 17:15 IST. This directly contributed to our transaction success rate dipping from 99.8% to 98.2% during that window, with the majority of failures logged as timeouts (Error Code: T101).\n\nOur Kibana logs show that the end-to-end processing time within our infrastructure—including the OAuth 2.0 token generation and request signing—remains stable at under 60ms. The significant delay is isolated to the response from ICICI’s `/creditline/v1/risk-assessment` endpoint. We’re tracking this issue under JIRA PAY-4735. The performance degradation is a critical concern, especially as we scale towards our target of 10K TPS, and it puts us at risk of breaching the performance SLAs outlined in our agreement (ref file#74325eeadc724d43).\n\nTo move this forward, I have the following action items:\n\n1.  **ICICI Bank Team (cc'd):** Could you please have your engineering team investigate the server-side processing logs for the `/creditline/v1/risk-assessment` service for the timestamp 16:45-17:15 IST yesterday? Any visibility into your internal service response times, database query loads, or potential cold start issues would be incredibly helpful.\n\n2.  **Aditya/Juspay SRE Team:** Please continue monitoring the network path from our GCP Mumbai region to ICICI's ingress points. Let's get MTR reports and any packet loss data appended to PAY-4735 to definitively rule out network-layer issues.\n\nMy priority is to get this resolved quickly to ensure a stable production environment ahead of the full-scale marketing launch. I will connect with the ICICI product team separately to provide a business-level update.

The intermittent timeouts are becoming a noticeable issue, with our Grafana dashboard (UPI-CL-Gateway-Health) showing error rate spikes to 2.5% during refresh windows, directly impacting user transaction success rates.\n\nRohan's team has proposed a fix: moving from a simple reactive retry on 401s to a proactive, stateful token management service. This service would preemptively refresh the token before expiry and store it in our encrypted secrets vault. While this sounds technically sound, we need to validate it from a compliance and security standpoint before it gets deployed. My primary concern is ensuring the new storage and access patterns for these tokens are fully compliant with PCI DSS 3.2.1 and our internal data governance policies. We can't risk creating a new vulnerability while fixing another.\n\nHere's the agenda I propose:\n1.  **Rohan:** Quick walkthrough of the proposed architecture for the token refresh service.\n2.  **Vikram:** Initial risk assessment on storing active auth tokens, even if encrypted. What are the audit and logging requirements?\n3.  **All:** Discuss the deployment strategy. Ananya, I'm thinking a feature flag (e.g., `icici-proactive-oauth-enabled`) would be prudent to enable this for a small subset of TIDs first.\n\n**Action Items from this sync will be:**\n- **Owner: Rohan (Eng)** - Create a one-page design spec on Confluence detailing the encryption method (is it AES-256?) and IAM role access for the new vault. ETA: Tomorrow EOD.\n- **Owner: Vikram (Risk)** - Review Rohan's spec and provide a formal risk sign-off. ETA: 2 days.\n- **Owner: Priya (Compliance)** - Based on the outcome, I will update the master 'UPI Credit Line - ICICI Integration' control mapping document, which will be the final step before closing this loop.\n\nkeywords: oauth, token refresh, compliance, rbi, pci dss, icici bank, pay-2904, risk assessment, feature flag","status":"confirmed","createdAt":1757930000000,"updatedAt":1757930120000,"app":"google-calendar","entity":"event","creator":{"displayName":"Priya Nair","email":"priya.nair@juspay.in"},"startTime":1757940600000,"endTime":1757944200000,"joiningLink":"https://meet.google.com/xyz-abcd-efg","permissions":["rohan.sharma@juspay.in","ananya.gupta@juspay.in","vikram.singh@juspay.in","ajay.mehra@juspay.in"]}},

The sustained transaction failures have clear service level agreement (SLA) and potential NPCI reporting implications, so we need to align internally before I reach out to the bank with a formal request.\n\nFrom the latest analysis on Kibana, we're seeing a consistent pattern of `HTTP 429` responses from their credit line authorization endpoint during peak hours (11 AM - 2 PM). This has pushed our failure rate to just over 4%, which is a breach of the contractual uptime guarantee in our partner agreement (Ref: Confluence Doc 'ICICI Partner Agreement', Section 4.2b). This isn't just a technical blip; it's a compliance risk we need to actively manage.\n\nMy proposed agenda is to finalize our two-pronged approach. First, short-term mitigation: Rohan, can we get an ETA on deploying the exponential backoff logic in the payment-gateway service as a temporary fix? Second, long-term resolution: I need the projected transaction volumes from Anjali to build a data-backed case for ICICI to permanently increase our TPS quota.

While the technical solution to cache the refresh token seems solid for resolving the API timeouts, we need to ensure it's fully compliant with RBI's Master Direction on Digital Payment Security Controls before we proceed to implementation.\n\nMy primary focus is on data residency and consent management. I've attached the draft technical spec from the Confluence page. My main questions for our discussion are: 1) Where exactly will the new refresh token be stored, and can we validate that the vault and its replication strategy are within India's geographical boundaries? 2) How are we logging the consent from the user for this extended token lifecycle, and can we surface this easily during an audit? We need to be crystal clear on this, especially since this is a credit line product.\n\nProposed agenda:\n1. (5 mins) Quick recap of PAY-9579 impact - Anjali.\n2.

Following up on our Slack thread, we need to finalize the root cause and define a remediation plan that is compliant with NPCI's T+1 settlement reporting guidelines. The current mismatch rate, although small, poses a regulatory risk we must close immediately.\n\nKarthik's analysis on the 'recon_mismatch_dataset_q3' in BigQuery strongly suggests the issue stems from a specific transaction state. It appears transactions flagged with a 'U53' (Beneficiary Bank Timeout) error code are being marked as successful in our Euler ledger but are correctly reversed in ICICI's final settlement file provided via their SFTP. This is causing a daily value mismatch of ~0.15% on the credit line portfolio. My initial thought is this could be a state-machine inconsistency in the payment-gateway service, where the reversal webhook isn't updating the transaction status in Euler correctly for this specific timeout scenario.\n\nHere are the proposed action items to get this resolved:\n1.  **Ravi (Eng):** Please investigate the payment-gateway's state transition logic for 'U53' error codes. We need a definitive technical RCA on why the reversal isn't being captured by our ledger. ETA for RCA is tomorrow, EOD.\n2.  **Karthik (Data):** Can you run a backfill script to identify all affected Transaction IDs since we went live? We need this list for manual reconciliation and for our formal incident report. Please aim to have this list ready by Friday.\n3.  **Sandeep (ICICI):** Could you confirm from your end if there have been any recent changes to how 'U53' errors are reported in the settlement files or through your APIs? Any change logs would be extremely helpful.\n4.  **Priya (Compliance):** I will begin drafting the preliminary incident report for our internal records and potential submission to NPCI based on these findings.

The proposed solution involves integrating our HyperSwitch payment orchestrator directly with ICICI's `FXRateLock_API_v3`. For each cross-border transaction, HyperSwitch will publish a `fx_settlement_request` event to a dedicated Kafka topic. A new microservice, 'ForexSettleEngine', will consume these events, obtaining a locked-in conversion rate from ICICI's API. The API response, containing the `quoteId`, `lockedRate`, and a 120-second `validityTimestamp`, must be immutably logged in our Cassandra `settlement_audit` keyspace before proceeding.","From a compliance standpoint, the ForexSettleEngine must perform a pre-settlement check against an internal Redis cache of RBI-published reference rates, updated every 30 minutes. Any deviation greater than 75 basis points will halt the transaction and generate a `FX_RATE_DISCREPANCY_HOLD` (Error Code: 6201) alert in Grafana, flagging it for manual review. If the check passes, the engine will invoke ICICI's `SettleNostroTransfer` endpoint with the `quoteId`. A failure to receive a success confirmation (ACK) within the 120-second validity window will trigger a state change to `SETTLEMENT_RETRY` in the transaction's finite state machine, initiating a specific backoff strategy. Three consecutive failures will result in an automated reversal and log a `CRITICAL_SETTLEMENT_FAILURE` (Error Code: 6205) for root cause analysis.","Actionable next steps are as follows: The Core Banking squad must prioritize the development of the ForexSettleEngine microservice using Spring Boot, ensuring all state transitions are idempotent. The DevOps team is tasked with configuring the mTLS certificates for ICICI's UAT environment (`https://api-uat.icicibank.com/partners/v3/fx`) and provisioning the `settlement_audit` keyspace in Cassandra with a 7-year data retention policy. A full end-to-end test plan, including simulation of Error Codes 6201 and 6205, must be submitted for compliance review before EOW.

Specifically, transactions are marked as 'SUCCESS' in our ScyllaDB `transactions_by_id` table following a 200 OK response from ICICI's `/creditline/debit` endpoint, but approximately 0.15% of these are subsequently missing from the T+1 settlement file. Log analysis in Kibana reveals these affected transactions consistently lack a corresponding `upi:resppauth` message from the NPCI switch within our configured 30-second consumer timeout window, resulting in our `Recon-Engine` logging a `RECON_MISMATCH_NPCI_ABSENT` error. The total unsettled amount over the last 48-hour cycle is INR 4.2 Lakhs.","The root cause appears to be a race condition on the issuer side. Our `pay-processor` service correctly logs the synchronous debit confirmation from ICICI, but ICICI's system seems to be sending this confirmation before receiving a definitive success state from the NPCI switch. For the failed cases, they are likely receiving a delayed timeout or a `U30` (Invalid Transaction) response from NPCI after they have already confirmed success to us. This creates 'ghost' successful transactions in our system that were never actually completed at the UPI network level. Our current `grace_period_ms` of 35000 in the reconciliation service is insufficient to catch these edge cases before marking them as settled.","As an immediate containment measure, a configuration change has been deployed to the `Recon-Engine` to introduce a 'PENDING_RECON' state for any UPI Credit Line transaction that does not receive a `resppauth` message. These transactions will be excluded from merchant settlement calculations until their status is definitively confirmed. The long-term recommendation is to mandate that ICICI Bank exposes a real-time Transaction Query API. This would enable our system to proactively poll for the definitive NPCI status of transactions stuck in the 'PENDING_RECON' state after a 60-minute threshold, providing a robust fallback mechanism.

Regarding the latency issue you highlighted, I've completed an initial investigation.\n\nBuilding on the analysis from file 6b5d116a0a2a4d93, the latency spike in our real-time risk scoring engine for the ICICI UPI Credit Line integration (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41) has been traced to a specific database bottleneck. \n\nHere’s a summary of my findings:\n\n**Performance Impact:**\nOur primary Grafana dashboard ('UPI-Credit-Line-Performance') shows that between 17:45 and 18:30 IST yesterday, the P99 latency for the `/risk/v2/assess` endpoint surged from a baseline of ~150ms to peaks exceeding 2.1s. This directly contributed to a 1.2% increase in transaction timeouts (Error Code: T408), which is a bit worrying as it breaches our internal threshold.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nAfter digging through Kibana logs for the `risk-engine-service` pods, I correlated the latency spikes with a high volume of `DBQueryTimeoutException` errors. The issue stems from an inefficient query hitting our primary Aurora PostgreSQL cluster. It appears the query fetching user transactional history for the fraud model is not using the correct index, leading to full table scans under heavy load (we were seeing around 12K TPS at the time of the incident).\n\nThe OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token generation via our auth service remained stable, with latencies holding steady at ~40ms, effectively ruling out any authentication-related issues.\n\n**Immediate Mitigation & Actions:**\n1.  **Short-term fix:** I've temporarily scaled the `risk-engine-service` Kubernetes deployment from 10 to 15 pods and increased the DB connection pool size. This has brought the P99 latency back down to a more manageable ~300ms, but this isn't a cost-effective or permanent solution.\n2.  **JIRA Ticket:** I've formally documented this incident and the ongoing work in JIRA PAY-8373 for tracking and future audit purposes.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n*   **Owner (Arjun/Sameer):** I'm working with Sameer from the DB team to analyze the query execution plan. We aim to have a patch with the optimized query or a schema update ready for review by EOD.\n*   **Owner (Arjun):** Once the patch is ready, I will deploy it to the staging environment and run a load test simulating 20K TPS to validate the fix and ensure we stay well below the 200ms latency target required to maintain our 99.95% uptime SLA.\n*   **Owner (Priya):** Could you help us assess the business impact based on the transaction volume affected during that 45-minute window? This will be crucial for our incident report.\n\nWe need to get this resolved quickly to ensure the platform's stability and maintain compliance with RBI's real-time processing guidelines. I'll post another update in JIRA PAY-8373 once the staging tests are complete.\n\nRegards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757911860000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","aditya.singh@juspay.in","sameer.patel@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","INBOX"]}},

It's becoming a pressing issue.\n\nOur engineering lead, Priya, has done a deep dive into our logs and metrics. Here’s a summary of our findings:\n\n1.  **Transaction Status:** We've cross-referenced our UPI gateway transaction logs in Kibana for the affected period. All transactions are marked as 'SUCCESS' on our end with valid NPCI response codes. We are not seeing any unexpected timeout or failure codes from our side.\n2.  **System Performance:** Our Grafana dashboards show no anomalies. API latency for the payment processing endpoint averaged 195ms, and our transaction success rate held steady at 99.7%, well within our operational SLAs. The system handled peak traffic of around 12K TPS without issue.\n3.  **Authentication Flow:** We've verified the OAuth 2.0 flow and JWT token management with your endpoints. There were no token expiry errors or authentication failures logged during the reconciliation window.\n\nThe evidence points towards the discrepancy arising during the batch processing on your end that generates the settlement file. It seems that while individual transactions are succeeding, they aren't being correctly aggregated into the final report. This is a bit concerning from a data integrity and RBI compliance standpoint.\n\nWe have created JIRA PAY-9813 to track this investigation from our side. Could you please have your technical team examine the logs for the specific settlement batch job that ran yesterday? Any information on potential errors or exceptions during that process would be invaluable.\n\nI think a quick sync-up call tomorrow morning with our respective tech leads would be the most efficient way forward.

Regarding the issue you highlighted in email 0d4f55057a0e4f1b about the elevated transaction failures, our team has completed a detailed investigation.\n\nOur analysis strongly indicates a cross-border payment routing configuration error on the ICICI Bank side for the UPI Credit Line integration (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41). We are consistently observing a spike in error code `U99 - Transaction Not Permitted` for transactions that should be processed domestically.\n\nHere are the technical specifics:\n\n*   **System & Endpoint:** The errors are originating from our calls to your `/creditline/v2/debit` endpoint. The initial OAuth 2.0 handshake and JWT token validation are successful, with p99 latency well within our 150ms target. The failure is happening at the core transaction processing stage.\n*   **Performance Impact:** Our Grafana dashboards show a jump in the error rate for this specific flow from a baseline of 0.2% to approximately 2.8% over the last 48 hours. This has pulled our overall success rate on the UAT environment down to 97.2%, which is a significant concern ahead of go-live.\n*   **Log Analysis:** Kibana logs for failed transactions (e.g., `transactionId: JPAY782029-UX91-4C5B`) show that our request payload correctly specifies `currency: 'INR'` and a valid domestic `mcc`. Despite this, the `U99` response suggests the transaction is being incorrectly interpreted by your routing engine as an international payment, which isn't permitted under the current RBI guidelines for this product.\n\nWe've tracked this behavior in JIRA PAY-6919 and attached a comprehensive log export as file#6b5d116a0a2a4d93 for your reference, which builds upon the initial findings we shared in email#da3cb3c3f3014883. Our suspicion is that a recent update to your BIN or VPA routing tables may be the root cause.\n\n**Action Items for ICICI Bank Team:**\n\n1.  Could your team please urgently review the routing logic and configuration tables for our assigned merchant ID on your UAT environment?\n2.  We request a verification of the rules governing VPAs linked to the credit line, ensuring they are correctly flagged for domestic-only processing as per the spec in Doc#ce9496d438634230.\n\nWe're getting a bit anxious as this directly impacts our Q3 launch timeline.

Building on your analysis in email ce9496d438634230, I’ve been looking into the compliance implications of the OAuth token refresh failures with ICICI's endpoints. The spike in P99 latency to over 2.5s is alarming, but my focus is on the potential gaps in our audit trail.\n\nFor the UPI Credit Line Integration project (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41), the integrity of our transaction logs is non-negotiable under RBI guidelines. When these API calls time out due to the token issue, it creates an ambiguity that could be flagged in an audit. My main question is: are we successfully logging the transaction attempt with a unique ID *before* the timeout occurs?\n\nI’ve been reviewing the Kibana logs associated with JIRA PAY-8487. I can clearly see the spike in `504 Gateway Timeout` errors on our Grafana dashboard, but correlating them with a pre-flight authentication failure log is proving difficult. If the session terminates before a unique transaction identifier is generated and logged, we have a significant gap. This violates the principle of non-repudiation, which is a cornerstone of our SOC 2 and PCI DSS compliance posture, as detailed in our data governance policy `file#6b5d116a0a2a4d93`.\n\nThis isn't just a theoretical problem; it has real-world impact on dispute resolution. If a user claims a transaction was attempted but we have no record of it, we are at a disadvantage. \n\nCould you please confirm the exact sequence of operations within our UPI gateway? Specifically, I need to know if a failure in the JWT token exchange with ICICI's OAuth 2.0 endpoint is captured as a distinct, auditable event in our system before the connection is dropped. \n\nPlease ensure the final Root Cause Analysis for PAY-8487 explicitly addresses this logging and data integrity concern.

Building on the initial analysis from email 554c8f6d87dd449e, my team has completed the root cause analysis for the spike in transaction failures on the new UPI Credit Line integration with ICICI Bank (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41).\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe issue was traced to a configuration error in our `payment-router-service` deployment. Specifically, the routing rules for cross-border transactions were incorrectly directing traffic to ICICI's domestic-only processing endpoint. Our investigation of the Kibana logs revealed a high volume of `NPCI_RESPONSE_CODE: U39 (Invalid Transaction Type)` errors, which correlated directly with transactions originating from international merchants.\n\nThe Grafana dashboard for this integration confirmed the scope: the error rate for cross-border payments peaked at 47% between 14:30 and 16:00 IST, while domestic transactions maintained a success rate of 99.8%. This misconfiguration meant any transaction flagged for international settlement was being rejected by ICICI's gateway before the OAuth 2.0 flow could even complete, hence the fast failures we were seeing (~150ms response times).\n\n**Impact:**\nWe estimate around 8,500 transactions failed during this period. While no sensitive data was exposed, the misrouting did generate incorrect entries in our settlement logs, which could have implications for our T+1 reconciliation and RBI compliance reporting. The security team has confirmed that since the requests were rejected at the gateway level, there was no risk to our PCI DSS or SOC 2 posture.\n\n**Resolution and Action Plan:**\n1.  **Immediate Hotfix:** We have prepared and tested a hotfix that corrects the endpoint mapping in the service's Kubernetes ConfigMap. This has been deployed to our staging environment.\n2.  **Staging Verification:** Testing in staging against a simulated load of 10k TPS shows a 100% success rate for the previously failing cross-border scenarios. P99 latency is holding steady at a nominal ~220ms.\n3.  **Production Deployment:** I have scheduled an emergency deployment for tonight at 23:00 IST to push the corrected configuration to production. I will personally oversee the rolling update to ensure zero downtime. All details are documented in **JIRA PAY-7708**.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nWe clearly need to prevent this from happening again. I propose we schedule a post-mortem early next week to review our CI/CD validation steps. I also believe we need to enhance our alerting; I'll work on creating a new alert in Grafana that specifically monitors the success rate delta between domestic and cross-border transactions for any new banking partner integration. This should have caught the anomaly much faster.\n\nI will update the thread once the production deployment is complete and stable.\n\nBest regards,\n\nArjun Mehta\nDevOps Engineer\nJuspay"],"timestamp":1757912580000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"arjun.mehta@juspay.in","to":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

This failure directly leads to subsequent `504 Gateway Timeout` errors on our transaction initiation API calls, impacting the end-user experience.\n\nFrom a metrics standpoint, the impact is significant:\n\n*   **Latency:** Our Grafana monitoring shows P99 latency spiking from a baseline of ~180ms to over 2.5s during these failure windows.\n*   **Error Rate:** The transaction failure rate jumps from a stable <0.15% to as high as 4.8% during these incidents, which is far outside the agreed-upon SLA for this integration.\n\nWe have created JIRA ticket PAY-6148 to track this, which contains detailed Kibana log snippets showing the exact 'Invalid JWT' error responses from your server prior to the timeouts. This pattern strongly suggests an issue with token validation or lifecycle management on the ICICI authentication server, especially since no changes have been made to our token generation logic, which was validated against the spec in file#6b5d116a0a2a4d93.\n\nAs you're aware, the stability of this auth mechanism is critical for us to remain compliant with RBI guidelines on transaction processing and system uptime. With our go-live date approaching, resolving this is my top priority.\n\nCould your technical team please investigate this with urgency? It would be helpful to know if any recent deployments or configuration changes have occurred on your OAuth service. To expedite a resolution, I would like to set up a joint debugging session with our gateway engineers and your API team.\n\nPlease let me know if your team is available for a call tomorrow at 11:30 AM IST. We need to get to a root cause swiftly to keep this project on its timeline.\n\nAppreciate your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRohit Sharma"],"timestamp":1757912700000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"rohit.sharma@juspay.in","to":["ankit.verma@icicibank.com"],"cc":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","srinivas.rao@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on the initial concerns raised in email b96f0c30f5c342f6, our team has completed a full performance analysis against your staging environment, and I'm writing to flag a critical issue.\n\nSince your core banking system (CBS) migration, we are observing a severe performance bottleneck that will prevent us from moving forward with the UAT for the UPI Credit Line integration (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41). \n\nHere are the specific metrics from our Grafana monitoring dashboard:\n\n1.  **API Latency:** The p99 latency for the `/creditLine/v2/debit` authorization endpoint has degraded significantly. Pre-migration, we were consistently seeing ~350ms. Post-migration, this is now spiking between 1.9s and 2.6s, which is untenable for a UPI transaction flow.\n2.  **Error Rates:** During our simulated load tests at a moderate 10K TPS, the transaction failure rate has jumped from a baseline of 0.3% to an alarming 4.8%. Our Kibana logs indicate that the majority of these failures are timeouts, and we are receiving a `CBS-UNAVAILABLE` error code from your end for these requests.\n3.  **System Isolation:** Our internal systems, including the OAuth 2.0 flow for token generation and JWT validation with your security module, are performing as expected with latencies remaining under 70ms. This strongly indicates the bottleneck is located within your new CBS or the intermediary services connecting to it.\n\nAs you can imagine, this is a major blocker. These performance numbers do not meet the minimum requirements for NPCI certification, and they will lead to a very poor user experience. The details of our findings and the relevant correlation IDs for the failed transactions have been documented in JIRA PAY-6148.\n\nTo resolve this, we need your immediate assistance. Could you please have your core banking and infrastructure teams investigate the end-to-end processing time on your side? We believe there might be a contention issue or a misconfiguration in the new environment's database connection pooling.\n\nI would like to propose a joint debugging session with your technical architects and our SRE team tomorrow to trace a few transactions in real-time. Please let us know a suitable time.\n\nWe are under pressure to meet the RBI's mandated go-live date, so resolving this latency issue is our highest priority. We need to get the p99 latency back under 400ms by the end of this week to keep the project on schedule.\n\nAppreciate your urgent attention to this.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiddharth Nair"],"timestamp":1757913000000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in","ananya.sharma@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["rohan.mehta@icicibank.com","priya.verma@icicibank.com"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT","IMPORTANT"]}},

Building on the details from your email (3a061e71a10443a0), I’ve spent the morning investigating the PCI audit finding for the UPI Credit Line Integration with ICICI Bank (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41).\n\nUnfortunately, I can confirm the issue is present and quite concerning. Our `upi-credit-auth` service is logging the full `creditLineIdentifier` string received from ICICI's `/v2/credit/authorize` endpoint. I was able to verify this by querying our Kibana instance against the production Kubernetes pod logs for the last 48 hours. The logs clearly show the unmasked identifier in the JSON payload.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is a critical issue. It represents a direct violation of PCI DSS Requirement 3.2, which prohibits the storage of sensitive authentication data post-authorization. Our external QSA is classifying the `creditLineIdentifier` as such, given it's a key component in the transaction flow. Failure to remediate this immediately will result in a formal finding and could delay our Attestation of Compliance.\n\nI’ve raised this as a high-priority ticket in JIRA (PAY-8154) and attached the relevant log samples. The root cause appears to be our generic logging middleware capturing the entire API response object before the data is passed to the settlement reconciliation service. While transaction success rates are stable at 99.7% and latency is within the 250ms SLA, this compliance gap overshadows our operational performance.\n\nWe need an immediate action plan. Here is what I propose:\n\n1.  **Immediate Containment (ETA: End of Day):** Can the SRE team deploy a hotfix to our logging configuration (Fluentd/Logstash) to apply a regex-based mask to the `creditLineIdentifier` field across all relevant services? This will stop the bleeding while a permanent fix is developed.\n2.  **Permanent Solution (ETA: 3 Business Days):** The engineering team needs to modify the `upi-credit-auth` service to explicitly exclude or transform this field before the payload is logged. The initial analysis in `file#6b5d116a0a2a4d93` suggests this is the most robust approach.\n3.  **Data Purge (ETA: 5 Business Days):** I will work with the infra and security teams to create a documented procedure for purging the historical, non-compliant logs from our archives to satisfy the auditor's request.\n\nThis has become the top priority for this project. Please let me know if your team has the bandwidth to tackle items 1 and 2 with this urgency. I'm happy to jump on a call to walk through the log data on Grafana if needed.

Building on your summary in email 85ed515ce4564178 regarding the PCI audit finding, I’ve spent the last few hours investigating the logs for the UPI Credit Line integration with ICICI Bank.\n\nUnfortunately, I can confirm the auditor's finding. We are logging sensitive token proxy identifiers from ICICI's OAuth 2.0 flow in plain text. Specifically, the JWT payload returned from their `/credit-line/auth` endpoint is being dumped into our Kibana logs (index: `prod-upi-credit-service-*`) without proper masking. This is a critical violation of PCI DSS v4.0 requirement 3.3 and exposes us to significant compliance risk for Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41.\n\nMy initial analysis points to a debug-level logging configuration that was incorrectly promoted to production during our last deployment cycle. The transaction flow itself is healthy—our Grafana dashboards show p99 latency holding steady at ~210ms and error rates below 0.2%—but this logging oversight is a serious issue that needs immediate remediation. I’ve documented the full technical details, including log samples and code pointers, in JIRA PAY-4093.\n\nHere is the immediate action plan I’ve initiated:\n\n1.  **Immediate Containment (Owner: Arjun Mehta):** I have a hotfix prepared that adjusts the Log4j2 configuration to correctly mask the sensitive fields in the JWT. It's passing all tests in our pre-prod environment. I am initiating an emergency deployment through our CI/CD pipeline now. ETA for production rollout is within the next 2 hours.\n\n2.  **Log Data Purge (Owner: Arjun Mehta, SRE Team):** We must purge the affected logs from our Elasticsearch cluster for the past 7 days to ensure no residual data remains. I'm coordinating with the SRE team to script this carefully to avoid any impact on Kibana's performance for other services. This is a bit delicate, so we're estimating 8-10 hours for completion.\n\n3.  **Root Cause Fix (Owner: Rahul Verma):** Rahul, can you please prioritize a permanent code change to prevent the entire JWT object from being logged in the first place? We should only be logging the transaction status and correlation ID. This should be a sub-task under JIRA PAY-4093.\n\n4.  **Auditor Communication (Owner: Priya Sharma):** Priya, could you draft a response to the auditors acknowledging the finding and confirming that remediation is underway? We can provide a full RCA, referencing the process from Doc#4e8ab5a33fe44135, once the hotfix is live and the logs are purged.\n\nI’ll be monitoring the deployment and will provide an update in the JIRA ticket as soon as the fix is live in production.

This represents a small but critical 0.12% of the transaction volume and poses a direct compliance risk against RBI's settlement timelines.\n\nOur internal investigation has confirmed the following:\n\n1.  **Successful Debit:** Our Kibana logs show that for all affected transactions, the `/v3/creditline/debit` API call was successful, and we received a success confirmation from the NPCI gateway.\n2.  **Reconciliation Failure:** The issue stems from these specific transactions being absent in the final T+1 settlement file (ref: file#6b5d116a0a2a4d93) provided by ICICI Bank. Our reconciliation engine flagged them correctly.\n3.  **Webhook Anomaly:** Our current hypothesis points towards a failure in the asynchronous settlement confirmation webhook from ICICI's systems. We are not seeing any corresponding hits on our listener endpoint (`https://api.juspay.in/v1/icici/settlement/notify`) for the RRNs of the failed transactions. This is also tracked under JIRA ticket PAY-8942.\n\nCould your technical team please investigate on your end? Specifically, we need to understand if these transactions were dropped during your internal settlement batch processing. Can you check the logs for the job that generates the daily settlement file?

Building on the analysis from your email 468a30a1964f41f7, the multi-currency settlement requirement for the ICICI UPI Credit Line integration is indeed a critical dependency we need to resolve.\n\nI've spent the morning digging into this. The core issue lies with the current settlement file format provided by ICICI, as specified in file#6b5d116a0a2a4d93. It's a standard batch process that exclusively supports INR settlements and lacks fields for source currency code, FX rate, or the converted amount. Our staging tests are failing consistently with `ERR_CURRENCY_MISMATCH` in the reconciliation service logs whenever a non-INR transaction is processed. You can query Kibana with `trace.id: \"upi-credit-settlement-multicurrency\"` to see the error stack.\n\nThis isn't just a parsing issue; it has significant compliance and performance implications. To adhere to RBI's FEMA guidelines for cross-border payments, we must log the specific FX rate applied at the time of settlement (T+1), not just at transaction time. Modifying our Settlement Reconciliation Service, which currently runs efficiently on our Kubernetes production cluster with a P99 latency of ~220ms, to perform real-time FX lookups or handle complex currency logic could degrade performance substantially, potentially breaching our 400ms SLA for batch processing.\n\nAs discussed in my previous update (email#da3cb3c3f3014883), ICICI has a separate REST-based API for FX settlements, but integrating it would be a major deviation from the current project scope for work a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41. The path of least resistance seems to be pushing ICICI to augment their existing settlement file. I have created JIRA PAY-4504 to formally track this feature gap and have attached our proposed file specification with additional fields for `sourceCurrency`, `fxRate`, and `settlementCurrencyAmount`.\n\nThis is becoming a bit of a blocker, and I'm concerned about the project timeline. We need a clear path forward by the end of this week.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.  **Siddharth (me):** I will escalate this with our contacts at ICICI Bank, Anjali Mehta and her team, and schedule a technical call by tomorrow, COB. I will push for a firm commitment on modifying their T+1 settlement batch file.\n2.  **Aditya:** Could your team please begin scoping the engineering effort required to update our reconciliation service based on the proposed spec in PAY-4504? A preliminary estimate would be helpful for my discussion with ICICI.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nI will update this thread with the outcome of the meeting with ICICI.

Building on your analysis in email cbc2bb30b6864038, the cross-border payment routing configuration error is indeed the root cause, and I’m seeing significant compliance implications.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, this is more than just a functional bug. I've been reviewing the Kibana logs from the last 24 hours, and it appears that approximately 2.5% of transactions initiated from international VPA handles were incorrectly flagged with a domestic country code before hitting the NPCI gateway. This is causing them to be rejected with NPCI error code `U69` (Invalid Transaction). The Grafana dashboard for the UPI gateway confirms this, showing a spike in these rejections correlating directly with the deployment yesterday.\n\nThis misrouting is a direct contravention of RBI’s FEMA guidelines for cross-border payments. We're creating an incorrect audit trail, and if this were in production, it would trigger an immediate reporting obligation. The core issue, as you pointed out, seems to be in the routing rules within our Kubernetes service mesh, which is failing to properly parse the country of origin from the JWT token passed by the authentication service.\n\nI’ve updated the main ticket for this project, JIRA PAY-2300, with these compliance-specific findings. I'm a bit concerned about our audit posture here, as our SOC 2 controls require explicit validation of routing logic for cross-border flows.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Aditya):** Please prioritize a hotfix for the staging environment. We need to validate the corrected routing logic before EOD. Can you confirm the ETA for the fix deployment?\n\n2.  **Compliance (Priya):** I will initiate a retroactive audit of the affected transaction logs in the staging environment to quantify the full scope. I'll need a log dump to trace the end-to-end flow for the impacted transaction IDs, a sample of which is in `file#6b5d116a0a2a4d93`.\n\n3.  **Risk Assessment:** I am starting a preliminary risk assessment to document the potential impact.

Here’s a summary of my findings:\n\n1.  **Latency Spikes**: Our Grafana dashboards show the p99 latency for ICICI’s `/upi/credit/auth` endpoint has degraded significantly, averaging 2100ms over the last 12 hours, with peaks reaching 2.8s. This is a stark contrast to the baseline of ~375ms we established last week.\n\n2.  **Increased Error Rates**: Transaction failures have climbed to 4.2%, predominantly from timeouts on our end waiting for a response. Our Kibana logs are filled with transaction timeouts leading to NPCI response code U30 (Transaction not permitted), which is impacting the customer experience even in staging.\n\n3.  **Infrastructure Health**: I've validated our infrastructure. The Kubernetes pods for the UPI gateway are healthy, with CPU and memory utilization well below our 70% alert threshold. Our outgoing connection pool to your ingress is stable and not saturated. The latency is almost entirely in the time-to-first-byte from your API gateway.\n\nThis issue is being tracked under JIRA PAY-4379.

Building on the initial analysis from your email (ee4b4e7e260e4c34), I've conducted a deeper investigation into the settlement mismatch for the UPI Credit Line transactions processed via ICICI Bank (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41).\n\nThe situation is a bit concerning. We have a discrepancy of INR 4,28,550 across 112 transactions for yesterday's T+1 settlement cycle. I've cross-referenced our production transaction logs with the settlement report provided by ICICI (file#6b5d116a0a2a4d93), and these transaction RRNs are entirely absent from their file, despite being marked as 'SUCCESS' in our UPI gateway.\n\nOur Grafana dashboards show the ICICI gateway performance was well within SLAs during this period—uptime at 99.98% and P99 latency at a stable 450ms. However, digging into the Kibana logs, I'm seeing a cluster of `U30` (NPCI Timeout) responses from ICICI's API just before the settlement cut-off. While our reconciliation logic is designed to handle these late success notifications, it appears there might have been a failure in the subsequent callback or the final reconciliation handshake for this specific transaction batch. This is the second such incident this month, which points to a systemic issue rather than a one-off glitch.\n\nThis mismatch directly impacts our compliance with RBI's T+1 settlement mandate and requires immediate resolution. I've logged JIRA PAY-8297 to track this issue formally and have already initiated communication with our technical counterparts at ICICI, referencing our previous discussion in email#da3cb3c3f3014883.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Ravi (Engg):** Could you please trace the full lifecycle for a few of the missing RRNs (I've attached them to PAY-8297)? We need to confirm if our system received a final success callback from ICICI post the initial `U30` timeout. Your findings here will be critical for our discussion with them.\n2.  **Priya (Finance):** Please continue with the manual reconciliation process and keep these 112 transactions flagged. We will proceed with a manual credit only after we receive a clear RCA and confirmation from ICICI.\n3.  **Myself:** I will escalate this with the ICICI product team if we do not receive a comprehensive incident report and an RCA by tomorrow, EOD. \n\nI am setting up a brief 30-minute internal call for 10:30 AM tomorrow to consolidate our findings before our weekly sync with the ICICI team.\n\nRegards,\n\nSiddharth Nair\nVendor Success Manager | Juspay"],"timestamp":1757914680000,"app":"gmail","entity":"mail","permissions":["aditya.singh.001@juspay.in"],"from":"siddharth.nair@juspay.in","to":["priya.sharma@juspay.in","ravi.kumar@juspay.in","anish.mehta@juspay.in"],"mimeType":"text/html","labels":["SENT"]}},

Building on your email (b91de6c0410b4c17), I've completed a compliance review of the settlement mismatch for the UPI Credit Line integration with ICICI Bank (Work ID: a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41).\n\nFrom a compliance and risk perspective, this is quite concerning. I've cross-referenced our transaction logs from the Kibana dashboard with the T+1 settlement file provided by ICICI (ref file#6b5d116a0a2a4d93) for yesterday's batch. The discrepancy currently stands at approximately 0.18% of the transaction count, which is well above our 0.05% alert threshold and represents a significant financial variance.\n\nThe pattern seems to be concentrated on transactions where our UPI gateway received a timeout from ICICI's `/creditline/payment` endpoint. Our asynchronous reconciliation job later marked these transactions as 'SUCCESS' based on a subsequent status query. However, the bank's final settlement report explicitly lists these same `transactionId`s with a 'RECON_FAIL' status, leading to the mismatch. This creates an audit trail issue and exposes us to financial liability for unsettled funds.\n\nThis discrepancy puts us in a difficult position regarding our T+1 settlement obligations under current RBI guidelines. We cannot have a situation where our system confirms a payment to the merchant, but the funds are not settled by the issuing bank. The integrity of our audit logs, a cornerstone of our SOC 2 and PCI DSS compliance, is compromised if the final state of a transaction remains ambiguous.\n\nI've updated JIRA PAY-1422 with these findings and attached a sample of the conflicting `transactionId`s for an in-depth technical review.\n\nAction Items:\n\n1.  **Engineering (Aditya):** Can you please prioritize an investigation into the state transition logic within our reconciliation service? We need to understand why it's prematurely flagging these timed-out transactions as 'SUCCESS' without a definitive, final settlement confirmation code from ICICI's system. We should consider introducing a 'PENDING_RECON' state to handle such cases.\n\n2.  **Compliance (Priya):** I will draft a preliminary incident report for the risk committee and start documenting the financial impact. I'll also prepare the necessary communication for our internal audit team.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWe urgently need to sync with the technical team at ICICI Bank to understand their exact logic for the 'RECON_FAIL' status and the expected error codes during API timeouts. Can we schedule a call with them by EOD today or tomorrow morning at the latest?

I've spent the morning digging into our logs and performance metrics, and I agree this needs urgent attention, especially with the upcoming festive season transaction volume projections.\n\nLooking at our Settlement-Performance-Dashboard on Grafana, the p99 latency for our `settlement-batch-processor` service spikes to over 2.5s during the T+1 settlement window. Kibana logs confirm the root cause: our current implementation makes sequential, blocking API calls to ICICI's `/v1/forex/rates` and then to `/v2/settlements/initiate` for each currency block. This is causing a significant number of `504 Gateway Timeout` errors—the rate is hovering around 1.2%—when we try to process batches exceeding 50 TPS. This inefficiency puts us at serious risk of violating RBI's T+1 settlement timeline mandate.\n\nAs tracked in JIRA PAY-4684, the ideal solution would be for ICICI Bank to provide a new, consolidated endpoint that accepts a batch of transactions with mixed currencies (INR, USD, EUR) and returns a single settlement confirmation with the applied forex rates. This would eliminate the chattiness of our current integration. I've reviewed their initial API spec doc (file#6b5d116a0a2a4d93) and it unfortunately doesn't cover this use case. We need to formally request this enhancement as it is critical for the overall success of the UPI Credit Line project (Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41).\n\nFurthermore, a single atomic transaction for settlement would simplify our audit trail for SOC 2 compliance, as we'd have one transaction ID linking the forex conversion and the settlement instruction, rather than correlating two separate API calls. We'd need to ensure any new endpoint continues to support our existing OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow with JWT token validation.\n\nHere are the immediate action items:\n\n1.  **Arjun (me):** I will draft a proposed API contract for this new batch settlement endpoint, building on our discussion in email#da3cb3c3f3014883, and share it by EOD tomorrow.\n2.  **Aditya (you):** Could you please socialize this requirement with our contacts at ICICI Bank and schedule a technical discussion for early next week?

The finding that fragments of the JWT payload from ICICI's OAuth 2.0 flow are being logged in plaintext is a clear and serious violation of PCI DSS requirement 3.2.

Building on the points from your last email (0740bb047c0b4336), I've had our team dig deeper into the performance degradation we're seeing on the UPI Credit Line integration.\n\nUnfortunately, the situation is more critical than we initially thought. We have definitive evidence that our transaction throughput is being severely impacted by API rate limiting on the ICICI Bank side. Our Grafana dashboards show a hard ceiling on our transaction processing that corresponds directly with a spike in `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` responses from your endpoints. This has become a primary blocker for the project under Work ID a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41.\n\nTo be specific, here are the key metrics we're observing:\n\n*   **Transaction Throughput:** Our systems are designed to push up to 600 TPS during peak load simulations in our staging environment. However, we're being throttled at approximately 150 TPS on the `/credit-line/v2/authorize` endpoint. This is a significant bottleneck.\n*   **Error Rate Spike:** This throttling is directly causing our transaction failure rate to jump from a baseline of 0.2% to over 4.1%. Our Kibana logs are filled with your specific error code `ICICI_ERR_RL01`, which confirms the rate-limiting cause.\n*   **Latency Impact:** The necessary retry logic and queuing on our side to handle these 429s is pushing the P99 latency for the end-to-end transaction flow from our target of <500ms to an alarming 2.1s. For a UPI payment, this latency is simply not viable and will lead to a poor customer experience.\n\nAs you know, meeting the RBI's guidelines for system stability and performance is non-negotiable. The current performance levels put us at risk of failing to meet these compliance standards, not to mention our internal SLAs. I've attached a new data export (see the referenced file#6b5d116a0a2a4d93 for an updated view) that illustrates this decline over the last 48 hours.\n\nFrankly, we are at a point where we need immediate intervention. This issue has been logged under JIRA PAY-4381 for formal tracking.\n\nHere are the action items we need from your team:\n\n1.  **Immediate Action:** Can you please have your infrastructure team review and increase the rate-limiting threshold for our specific OAuth client ID to at least 800 TPS? This needs to apply to both the transaction authorization and status check endpoints. We need this change implemented in the UAT environment by EOD tomorrow to proceed with our performance testing.\n2.  **Technical Discussion:** I'd like to schedule a 30-minute call with your lead architect early next week to discuss your load balancing and auto-scaling capabilities. We need to ensure your system can handle dynamic traffic spikes, as our production forecasts are significantly higher than the current limits allow.\n\nWe're committed to making this integration a success, but we can't move forward with this technical constraint in place. Please let me know the ETA for the rate limit increase.

Your analysis in email 3860ab2e411d4e61 aligns with what I'm seeing from a compliance and logging perspective.\n\nThese API timeouts are becoming a critical issue. From a compliance standpoint, the intermittent failures in the OAuth token refresh flow with ICICI Bank are creating significant gaps in our audit trails. When our service times out waiting for a token, we log an HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout instead of a definitive success or failure from the bank's system. This ambiguity is a serious concern for RBI's Digital Payment Security Controls and will be a major point of inquiry during our next audit cycle.\n\nI've been reviewing the Kibana logs for the trace IDs associated with JIRA ticket PAY-1508. The pattern is consistent: our `credit-line-service` attempts to refresh the JWT, encounters an extended delay or an `InvalidGrant` error from ICICI's `/token` endpoint, and subsequently, the originating `/credit/authorize` API call fails. Our Grafana dashboard (`credit-line-service-prod`) shows a direct correlation between these token refresh failures and a spike in P99 latency to over 2.5s, which is well outside our acceptable threshold of 392ms.\n\nWhile the engineering team implements a more robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff, this is ultimately a stopgap. The root cause lies with the instability of ICICI's OAuth infrastructure. This directly impacts our ability to meet the 99.97% uptime SLA for this integration.\n\nMy action items are:\n1.  Formally document this incident with all supporting logs and Grafana snapshots (as attached in file#6b5d116a0a2a4d93) and append it to JIRA PAY-1508. This is crucial for our SOC 2 evidence.\n2.

Building on your email (94d296cf549a4423), I've spent the last few hours investigating the latency spikes on the real-time risk scoring engine for the ICICI UPI Credit Line integration.\n\nHere’s a summary of my findings:\n\n**1. Performance Impact:**\nThe Grafana dashboard for our UPI Credit Line service confirms intermittent P99 latency spikes reaching up to 1.2s between 14:30 and 15:15 IST today. This is a major deviation from our service baseline of <150ms. This directly contributed to a rise in transaction timeouts, with the error rate for the ICICI integration climbing from a nominal 0.2% to nearly 1.5% during the incident window. Kibana logs show a cluster of `U69` (Transaction timed out) errors correlating with these spikes.\n\n**2. Investigation So Far:**\nMy initial analysis suggests this is not an infrastructure bottleneck. The Kubernetes pods for the `risk-engine-v2` service scaled nominally, and both CPU and memory utilization on the nodes remained well within our defined thresholds. I also ruled out database contention; our primary PostgreSQL instance showed no slow queries or connection pool exhaustion.\n\n**3. Preliminary Root Cause Hypothesis:**\nThe issue appears to be application-level. By correlating trace IDs in Kibana, I've noticed a pattern: the highest latency requests correspond to transactions with a significantly larger-than-average payload size in the POST requests to our `/v1/credit/assess` endpoint. It appears new, deeply nested JSON objects related to user credit history might have been added by ICICI Bank. Our current deserialization logic might not be optimized for this new structure, causing CPU-bound contention within the service.\n\nThis change was not outlined in the original integration spec (referenced in our initial planning email da3cb3c3f3014883) and is a bit concerning, as these timeouts put our 99.95% uptime SLA at risk. Any fix will, of course, require rigorous testing in staging to ensure we don't introduce regressions and remain compliant with RBI's processing timelines.\n\nI have formally logged this under JIRA PAY-6809 for tracking. As a next step, could you please check with the partner integration team if we received any formal communication from ICICI Bank regarding this API payload change? I suspect it might have been an unannounced modification on their side.\n\nI'll continue to analyze the raw payloads to build a more definitive case. If we don't find any notification, we should probably escalate and request an urgent sync with their technical team.

Our Grafana dashboards show that the P99 latency for the `/creditline/payment` endpoint on ICICI's side is spiking to ~2.1s for these specific failed transaction IDs, which is breaching our configured API gateway timeout of 1800ms. The Kibana logs confirm our system is correctly initiating a reversal with error code `GW_TIMEOUT_REVERSAL`, but ICICI's settlement file (referenced in email#da3cb3c3f3014883) marks these as successful debits. This discrepancy is being tracked under JIRA PAY-3119.\n\nWhile the failure rate is currently low at ~0.12%, the manual effort for reconciliation is becoming a significant operational overhead.

Following the Slack discussion, we need to formally agree on the root cause and, more importantly, the remediation plan. The initial diagnosis points to a configuration error in our `payment-router` service following the `dep-88cde1` deployment, specifically affecting the SGD->INR corridor for the new UPI Credit Line product.\n\nFrom a compliance standpoint, I want to ensure our fix is not just a technical patch but also addresses the process gap that allowed this to happen. The Grafana dashboard 'Cross-Border Txn Monitor v2' clearly shows a spike in `T07` (Invalid Currency Code) errors, peaking at 12% for that specific corridor. This has implications for our transaction reporting and potentially violates certain FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) data integrity principles. We need to confirm the exact point of failure – was it pre- or post-FX conversion logic?\n\nHere are the proposed action items for discussion and assignment:\n1. **Final RCA Confirmation:** Ravi, please walk us through the logs from Kibana that pinpoint the misconfigured routing rule. We need to be 100% certain before proceeding.\n2. **Hotfix Strategy:** Anjali, let's discuss the proposed hotfix. A simple rollback might be risky. I think a targeted patch to the currency validation logic within the router is safer. Can we get a PR for this by EOD?\n3. **Compliance Documentation:** I will take the action item to draft an incident report for our internal audit trail, referencing PAY-4165. This is required for our quarterly RBI reporting.\n4. **Vendor Sync:** Amit, it would be helpful to know if ICICI's gateway logged these as malformed requests and if there's any downstream impact we should be aware of.","status":"confirmed","createdAt":1757919900000,"updatedAt":1757919900000,"app":"google-calendar","entity":"event","creator":{"displayName":"Priya Nair","email":"priya.nair@juspay.in"},"startTime":1757920500000,"endTime":1757924100000,"joiningLink":"https://meet.google.com/pdn-qwer-jkl","permissions":["priya.nair@juspay.in","ravi.kumar@juspay.in","anjali.sharma@juspay.in","sandeep.menon@juspay.in","amit.verma@icicibank.com"]}},

The current false positive rate is hovering around 3.8% for transactions over ₹2,000, which is significantly impacting the user experience and is in breach of our internal risk appetite threshold of 1.5%. The Grafana dashboard 'UPI-Credit-Line-FDE-Metrics' clearly shows the spike began immediately after the `release-candidate-2024-05-14b` deployment. The primary driver seems to be the 'New-User-High-Value' rule set, which is too aggressive for the expected user behavior on a new credit product.\n\nAfter reviewing the Kibana logs for rejected transaction IDs, Suresh has confirmed that the model's feature weighting for `device_age` combined with `first_transaction_of_day` is the main culprit. This is inadvertently flagging legitimate early morning top-ups by new users. While we need to remain compliant with anti-fraud norms, blocking this volume of genuine transactions poses a significant business and reputational risk. We need to find a balance before the wider marketing campaign begins next week.\n\nBased on our discussion, we have agreed on a two-pronged approach. Here are the immediate action items:\n\n*   **AI-1 (Owner: Suresh Kumar):** Deploy a hotfix to the FDE model to reduce the weight of the `device_age` feature by 40% specifically for the 'New-User-High-Value' rule. Target deployment: EOD today. Please create a sub-task under PAY-5021 for tracking.\n*   **AI-2 (Owner: Rohan Verma):** Set up a dedicated alert in Prometheus to monitor the rejection reason code `FDE_RULE_NUHV_BLOCK` and trigger if the rate exceeds 2% in any 15-minute window post-deployment.\n*   **AI-3 (Owner: Priya Nair):** Document this decision and the revised risk posture in the project's Confluence page ('ICICI UPI CL - Risk & Compliance Register') for our audit trail. ETA: Tomorrow, May 16th.\n*   **AI-4 (Owner: Anika Sharma):** Prepare a brief for the product leadership team outlining the issue, the mitigation steps taken, and the revised go-live confidence score.

As per our analysis on BigQuery, the discrepancy is consistently around 0.12%, impacting transactions that occur close to the midnight cut-off. This is a significant compliance and financial risk that we need to address before expanding the pilot.\n\nHere’s a summary of findings from the 'UPI-CL-Recon' Grafana dashboard:\n- The missing transactions are primarily those where the final NPCI confirmation (RRN) is received post-00:00 IST.\n- Our Euler ledger correctly marks these as successful based on the delayed callback.\n- However, ICICI's daily settlement file (SFTP push at 04:00 IST) seems to exclude these transactions, likely due to a stricter T-day cut-off logic in their batch generation system. We need to confirm if they are accounting for it in T+2 or if it's a permanent miss.\n\nProposed Agenda & Next Steps:\n1.  **[Anjali]** Walk through the query results showing the specific transaction IDs and their state transitions in our system vs. their absence in the settlement file.\n2.  **[Vikram]** Can you help us understand ICICI's settlement file generation logic? Specifically, the exact cut-off time and timezone, and how late success responses from the UPI network are handled.\n3.  **[Ravi]** Based on the discussion, outline a short-term fix. I'm thinking of a patch for our reconciliation service to hold these specific transactions and re-attempt reconciliation against the T+2 file. Is this feasible?\n4.  **[All]** Decide on a long-term solution. Should we request an API-based reconciliation endpoint from ICICI, or do we need to build more resilience into our batch processing logic? The action owner for this will be Aditya, to document in the PRD.\n\nMy primary goal here is to get clarity from ICICI and agree on an engineering path forward. Let’s get this resolved so Finance can close the books accurately.

Following up on the Slack discussion, there's a potential compliance gap in how we log forex conversion details for transactions initiated in currencies like USD or AED. The current settlement file spec from ICICI (v2.3) provides the final amount in INR, but it doesn't explicitly state the conversion rate or the exact timestamp of conversion, which is a requirement for our internal audit trail and RBI reporting under the latest FEMA guidelines.\n\nAditya has proposed a potential solution: enriching our transaction data by making a separate, near-real-time call to an ICICI Forex Inquiry API *before* the transaction is committed to our Euler ledger. This would give us the data points we need. However, from a compliance standpoint, I need to understand the robustness of this approach. What are the failure modes? For instance, if the Forex API call fails or times out, do we fail the transaction or proceed without the forex data? Proceeding without it creates a reconciliation nightmare and a compliance finding. Failing the transaction could impact user experience and our transaction success rate (SR) metric.\n\nLet's use this time to finalize the flow. The main agenda is to decide on the definitive handling of these API failure edge cases. We need to agree on a retry mechanism, a timeout threshold, and a final fallback procedure. Anjali, can you also weigh in on how this would impact the finance team's reconciliation reports generated from BigQuery? The goal is to get a consensus so I can document the approved process and its associated risks in the project's Confluence page, which is the final step before we can seek formal sign-off for UAT deployment.\n\n**Action Items:**\n- **Decision:** Finalize the fallback logic for failed Forex API calls. (Owner: All)\n- **Aditya:** Provide p99 latency and availability stats for the Forex Inquiry API from ICICI's UAT environment. (ETA: Before meeting)\n- **Meera:** Document the sequence diagram for the proposed flow, including the failure paths.

Our internal API gateway, Kong, is logging a high volume of HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` responses from ICICI's `/creditline/v2/debit` endpoint. This throttling begins precisely when our transaction throughput exceeds 900 TPS, far below the contractually agreed-upon 1500 TPS. The responses do not include a `Retry-After` header, indicating a hard ceiling rather than a burstable quota, which presents a significant compliance and operational risk for live traffic.","Splunk queries on our `icici-connector-svc` logs confirm the issue, correlating directly with a spike in our internal error code `J_EXT_THROTTLED`. During a 10-minute test window simulating peak load (~1250 TPS), we observed a failure rate of 28%, with p99 latency for failed requests climbing to over 3000ms. ICICI's error payload contains a proprietary code `GW-RL-003` ('Static Quota Exceeded'), which their technical documentation confirms is a fixed, non-negotiable limit per originating IP. This directly contravenes section 4.1b of the signed Master Service Agreement, which mandates support for sustained high-volume processing.","As an immediate mitigation, engineering is deploying a circuit breaker pattern using Resilience4j within the connector service to prevent cascading failures in our downstream systems. However, this is a reactive measure. From a compliance standpoint, proceeding to production with this limitation is untenable as it guarantees failure to meet NPCI's prescribed success rate guidelines. I have formally escalated this discrepancy via JIRA PAY-8008 and scheduled an urgent review with the ICICI Bank relationship manager, citing the contractual breach.
