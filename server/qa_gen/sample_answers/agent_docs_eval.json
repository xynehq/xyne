This is flagged as a major red flag for upcoming SOC 2 audits.\n4.  **KYC/AML Non-compliance:** Failures in the KYC verification process for high‑risk segments are a direct compliance concern under the RBI's Master Direction on KYC and AML guidelines.\n5.  **Cross‑Border Processing Violations:** Misrouting INR‑denominated transactions to EU clusters is noted as contravening RBI guidelines on data localization and payment processing. Other cross‑border issues pose risks related to FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) reporting.",

The `slidingWindow.interval` parameter was inadvertently reduced to 60 seconds from the specified 300 seconds during a Helm chart upgrade (`chart-version: 3.4.1`). This caused the 'Anomalous Refund Pattern' model to misinterpret short-term refund bursts as fraudulent activity.\n\nThe two-part plan to address this was:\n1.  **Immediate Hotfix:** Trigger a new Jenkins pipeline (`hotfix-PAY-1691`) to revert the `slidingWindow.interval` parameter back to 300 seconds in the staging environment, followed by a production rollout after validation.\n2.  **Future Prevention:** Implement a schema validation check within the CI/CD pipeline using Conftest to prevent similar configuration drifts in future Helm chart deployments.",

    "Agentic_answer": "Based on the emails in the context, here are the main compliance risks and regulatory concerns mentioned regarding the Flipkart refund settlement issues:## Major Compliance Risks & Regulatory Concerns### 1. **RBI Audit Scrutiny**The prolonged discrepancy is identified as a compliance risk that could draw scrutiny during their next RBI audit . The failure to properly handle settlement discrepancies demonstrates a need for decisive action to maintain regulatory compliance.### 2. **T+1 Settlement Cycle Violations**The delay in resolution from Flipkart's side is becoming a significant concern, especially with Juspay's T+1 settlement cycle requirements . The failure to meet these timelines could result in regulatory penalties and audit findings.### 3. **Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) Issues**The failed transactions are not being captured in automated SAR (Suspicious Activity Reporting) pre-screening, creating discrepancies in the T+1 settlement report for their partner bank . This directly impacts adherence to RBI's guidelines on payment settlements.### 4. **SOC 2 Audit Implications**The cross-border payment routing error could be flagged in their next SOC 2 audit . The compliance team specifically notes that these issues create messy audit trails that could pose problems for their upcoming SOC 2 and PCI DSS audits .### 5. **AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Guideline Compliance**The system triggers re-verification steps for refunds in line with RBI's AML guidelines, particularly for customers flagged as 'high-risk' . Failures in this process create compliance gaps in their KYC automation workflow.### 6. **Weekly Regulatory Reporting Deadlines**The compliance team is concerned about resolving issues before their weekly regulatory reporting deadline on Friday , indicating strict regulatory reporting requirements that must be met.### 7. **T+2 Settlement SLA Risks**Multiple emails mention the risk of breaching T+2 settlement SLA mandated by RBI guidelines . The growing backlog of unprocessed refunds is creating a serious compliance concern that could result in regulatory violations.### 8. **Currency Code Compliance**The cross-border routing error was causing refunds to be incorrectly routed through international gateways, leading to invalid currency code errors . This type of routing mistake has significant regulatory implications for domestic payment processing.### 9. **Audit Trail Requirements**The need for enhanced audit logging and clear success/failure status for refunds is emphasized as critical for future audit trails . Poor audit trails could result in regulatory findings during compliance reviews.The overall impact shows that these technical issues have created a cascade of compliance risks affecting multiple regulatory frameworks including RBI guidelines, SOC 2 requirements, and AML compliance protocols.",

    "Answer": "Based on the provided documents, multiple distinct root causes for API timeouts and high latency have been identified:\n\n1.  **Performance Bottleneck post-Core Banking Migration:** The p99 latency on Flipkart's refund status API spiked from ~400ms to over 2,500ms, causing a 3.8% error rate and `ReadTimeoutException` errors. (doc: `e12c294e1c3940bf`)\n2.  **Risk Scoring Engine Degradation:** Flipkart's real-time risk scoring engine's p99 latency peaked at over 2.3s (from a baseline of ~180ms), leading to a 3.2% failure rate and `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors. (doc: `53a52db25bba49e3`)\n3.  **Multi-Currency Forex Lookups:** Timeouts to an external forex data provider caused P99 latency to exceed the 2000ms service timeout, resulting in a nearly 4% error rate. (doc: `4fbbd82a039f42cb`)\n4.  **KYC Automation for High-Risk Segments:** Calls to Flipkart's `/v2/customer/kyc/status` endpoint for high-risk users saw latency spike to over 2.5s (from a 450ms baseline) with a 4.8% error rate, resulting in `KYC_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT` (Error Code: 4082). (doc: `b01939696ed44325`)\n5.  **API Rate Limiting:** Aggressive rate limiting by Flipkart's `/refunds/v1/query` endpoint resulted in `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors, degrading p99 latency from ~350ms to over 2.1s. (doc: `6e9d81aaa2ce458c`)\n6.  **OAuth 2.0 Token Refresh Failure:** Requests with expired JWTs to Flipkart's authorization server took ~2.5 seconds to respond instead of immediately rejecting, causing `ReadTimeoutException` errors and pushing the reconciliation job's error rate to nearly 4.5%. (doc: `106bbe795e774749`)\n7.  **Post-Authentication Processing Bottleneck:** Even after a successful token refresh, calls to `/v2/refunds/initiate` timed out, with P99 latency degrading from ~250ms to over 2,800ms and error rates spiking to 4.5%.

    "Agentic_answer": "Based on the comprehensive investigation data available, I can identify several distinct root causes for API timeouts and high latency when processing Flipkart refunds, along with their associated metrics:## Root Causes and Associated Metrics### 1. OAuth Token Refresh Failures**Root Cause**: OAuth token refresh failures on Flipkart's side causing authentication issues **Associated Metrics**:- **Error Codes**: 401 unauthorized errors showing as spikes in Grafana - **Error Reference**: Error ref `809455` appearing frequently in logs - **Batch Impact**: Multiple batches affected including run ID `777284` and batch `234404` - **Dashboard**: Grafana shows spikes in 401s right before batch failures ### 2. API Rate Limiting and Throttling**Root Cause**: Flipkart's API rate limiting causing throttling of refund settlement endpoints **Associated Metrics**:- **Error Codes**: 429 (Too Many Requests) errors from Flipkart's end - **Impact**: Processing throughput significantly reduced - **Batch IDs Affected**: 455809 , 673447 , 788159 - **Dashboard**: Grafana shows throttling errors and error rate spikes ### 3. KYC Verification Timeouts for High-Risk Users**Root Cause**: Fraud-engine timing out during KYC verification specifically for high-risk user segments, suspected payload mismatch with Flipkart's API **Associated Metrics**:- **Error Codes**: 5xx errors from Euler for KYC workflow - **Specific Cases**: User ID `996233` where requests hang indefinitely - **JIRA Reference**: PAY-1736 tracking this root cause - **Behavior**: Request hangs rather than proper timeout handling ### 4. Core Banking System Bottlenecks**Root Cause**: Bottlenecks in the core banking system causing settlement mismatches **Associated Metrics**:- **Unique ID Pattern**: `291489` pattern observed in JIRA PAY-6398 - **Impact**: Settlement mismatches flagged by Flipkart - **Data Processing**: BigQuery queries taking extended time to complete ### 5. Misconfigured Client Secrets**Root Cause**: Misconfigured OAuth client secret on Flipkart's side **Associated Metrics**:- **Resolution**: Hotfix deployment showing immediate improvement - **Success Indicators**: API calls returning successful 200 status codes - **Performance**: Timeouts dropped significantly after fix - **JIRA Reference**: PAY-5450 for tracking RCA ## Key Performance Indicators Monitored- **Grafana Dashboard**: Primary monitoring tool for error rates, timeouts, and API response codes- **Error Rate Tracking**: Spikes in 401s, 429s, and 5xx errors- **Batch Processing**: Multiple batch IDs tracked for failure analysis- **BigQuery Analytics**: Used for isolating failed refunds and generating impact reports- **Euler Dashboard**: Monitoring settlement job performance and throttling errorsAll these issues are being tracked under the central work ID `318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9` with various JIRA tickets for detailed investigation and resolution tracking.",

(doc: `7040d4d69f0a4a0f`)\n\n2.  **Missing International Flag:** For refunds on international card transactions, the `is_international: true` flag was missing in the API payload from Flipkart. This caused the requests to be incorrectly routed through Juspay's domestic UPI gateway, which failed with an `Error Code: 5042 (Acquirer Mismatch)`. (doc: `ec3595e5558a4cf0`)\n\n3.  **Incorrect BIN Identification:** A misconfigured ruleset in Juspay's payment routing service incorrectly flagged a range of international card BINs as domestic. This caused refund requests to be sent to the wrong settlement processor, triggering an `INVALID_ROUTING_ID` error from Flipkart's `/v2/refunds/initiate` endpoint. (doc: `0880c93cdb534bd4`)\n\n4.  **Data Center Misrouting:** INR-denominated refund requests from Flipkart were intermittently routed to Juspay's EU-based cluster (`api.eu.juspay.io`) instead of the correct India cluster (`api.in.juspay.io`). This caused the validation layer to fail with a `422_INVALID_CURRENCY_FOR_REGION` error. (doc: `59c90ba34a584db0`)",

    "Agentic_answer": "Based on my analysis of the email threads and related communications about the Flipkart settlement discrepancy (Work ID: 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9), I can identify several distinct payment routing problems. Here's a comprehensive summary:## Payment Routing Problems Identified### 1. Cross-Border Routing Configuration Error**Root Cause:** The settlement orchestrator was incorrectly routing domestic refunds through an international gateway instead of domestic channels .**Resulting Error:** Flipkart's settlement API rejected transactions with `ERROR_CODE: 422_INVALID_CURRENCY_CODE`, affecting approximately 15,000 transactions .### 2. Missing International Transaction Flag**Root Cause:** For refunds linked to original international card transactions, Flipkart's `refund.initiate` API calls were missing the `is_international: true` flag in the payload .**Resulting Error:** Requests were incorrectly routed through domestic UPI gateway instead of international acquiring partner, resulting in `Error Code: 5042 (Acquirer Mismatch)` during reconciliation .### 3. Multi-Currency Settlement Processing Issues**Root Cause:** The settlement-batch-processor service had problems with forex rate lookups for non-INR transactions, with intermittent API connection timeouts to the forex data provider during nightly T+1 settlement windows .**Resulting Error:** P99 latency spiked above 2000ms timeout threshold, causing fallback to potentially stale rates from Redis cache with 4% error rate .### 4. API Rate Limiting Impact on Settlement Processing**Root Cause:** Flipkart's refund status API was aggressively rate-limiting Juspay's requests .**Resulting Error:** `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors flooded the system, throttling effective throughput from 250 TPS to 50-60 TPS, creating a backlog of over 20,000 transactions .### 5. API Timeout Issues Post-Authentication**Root Cause:** Even after successful OAuth 2.0 token acquisition, API calls to Flipkart's `/v2/refunds/initiate` endpoint were timing out consistently .**Resulting Error:** P99 latency degraded from ~250ms to over 2,800ms, with TCP connections established but no response received before 3-second timeout threshold .### 6. KYC Automation Workflow Failures**Root Cause:** High rate of KYC verification failures for customer segments flagged as 'high-risk', with Juspay's system triggering re-verification by calling Flipkart's `/v2/customer/kyc/check` endpoint .**Resulting Error:** Consistent `422 Unprocessable Entity` responses with `KYC_DATA_MISMATCH` errors, blocking refunds from processing and creating settlement file discrepancies .## Overall ImpactThese routing problems collectively created:- A total variance exceeding ₹1.2 Cr over 72 hours - Violations of T+1 settlement SLA requirements [multiple sources]- Compliance risks under RBI guidelines - PCI audit findings for failure to comply with timely detection and response requirements The problems were tracked across multiple JIRA tickets (PAY-9660, PAY-6869, PAY-2991, PAY-5349, PAY-6262, PAY-5176, PAY-1054, PAY-2864) and required coordinated fixes from both Juspay and Flipkart teams.",

The implicated service is the **authentication service** (docId: a5f262d5d63e4011).\n\n2.  **High False Positives (FRM-802):** The cause is an overly sensitive `vpa_velocity_threshold` and disproportionately high weighting for `device_fingerprint_entropy`. The implicated model is the **MandateVelocityScorer-v2** within the HyperSentry fraud engine (docId: b1ced9640b604a7f).\n\n3.  **Domestic Transaction Misrouting:** A faulty JWT claim within the OAuth 2.0 flow failed to differentiate domestic vs. international mandates, leading to a compliance breach. The issue lies within the **payment routing configuration** (docId: b0bc09865e2f4193).\n\n4.  **International Transaction Failures (U69):** A misconfiguration in a Kubernetes deployment is causing the service to fail to initiate the OAuth 2.0 flow for non-INR transactions. The implicated service is the **`upi-router-service`** (docId: ee7a1feed503420e).\n\n5.  **Settlement Discrepancy:** The system is not correctly processing asynchronous late reversal notifications (response code `U69`) from NPCI, leading to a mismatch in the settlement ledger.

    "Answer": "The overall status of the UPI Mandate project (Work ID 452e9925-ad87-426d-afa1-7736d193d4b2) appears to be critical, with multiple high-priority incidents occurring simultaneously. The emerging risk profile is multi-faceted, spanning regulatory, financial, and operational domains:\n\n*   **Regulatory & Compliance Risk:** There is a direct and serious breach of RBI's FEMA guidelines due to domestic transactions being misrouted internationally (docId: b0bc09865e2f4193). This requires mandatory reporting and has created a non-compliant audit trail. Additionally, there are concerns about RBI compliance for real-time processing due to latency spikes (docId: a5f262d5d63e4011) and potential self-reporting to NPCI (docId: ee7a1feed503420e).\n*   **Financial Risk:** A settlement discrepancy is causing reconciliation gaps, impacting 142 transactions in one batch. This requires manual data correction to ensure books are balanced (docId: a319e7ad79454258).\n*   **Operational & Business Risk:** Multiple services (`authentication service`, `upi-router-service`, `upi-mandate-processor`) and models (`MandateVelocityScorer-v2`) are experiencing issues. This has led to high latency (1.9s vs 300ms SLA), high transaction failure rates (up to 4.8%), and a high false positive rate (4.2% vs <1.0% threshold). This is causing significant customer friction, an increase in support tickets, and is jeopardizing Q3 goals for mandate adoption (docId: 0cf90ecc5cb54b45).\n*   **Technical Risk:** There are repeated failures related to the OAuth 2.0 and JWT token flow, as well as questions about the effectiveness of CI/CD pipeline validation which failed to catch critical configuration errors before deployment (docId: b0bc09865e2f4193, ee7a1feed503420e).",

    "Agentic_answer": "Based on the comprehensive context from across your systems, here's the overall status and risk profile for the UPI Mandate project:## Project Status OverviewThe UPI Mandate project appears to be experiencing significant operational challenges, primarily centered around **Flipkart settlement discrepancies** (Work ID: 318b8082-efd0-4f33-8696-c6979e9a6cd9). The project is actively being worked on with multiple engineering teams collaborating to resolve various integration issues .## Current Risk Profile### **High-Risk Areas Identified:**1. **KYC Automation Failures** - Fraud-engine timing out on KYC verification for high-risk user segments - Causing reconciliation blocks and settlement discrepancies - Specific cases documented (e.g., user ID 996233, UID 983213)2. **API Integration Vulnerabilities** - OAuth token refresh failures causing timeout issues - Rate limiting problems affecting refund endpoints - Cross-border payment routing configuration errors3. **Fraud Detection Model Issues** - Excessive false positives on refunds - Model sensitivity requiring data science team review - Specific impact on high-risk customer segments4. **Settlement Reconciliation Gaps** - UPI transaction timing mismatches between systems - Delayed reversal updates missing in EOD reconciliation jobs - Status mismatches between internal and Flipkart systems### **Operational Impact:**- **Multiple JIRA tickets** being actively tracked (PAY-1736, PAY-4869, PAY-9787, PAY-3500, PAY-5030, etc.) - **Manual interventions** frequently required for reconciliation - **Cross-team coordination** needed with Flipkart technical teams ### **Positive Developments:**- **Proactive issue resolution** with quick turnaround on fixes - **Strong collaboration** between internal teams and Flipkart - **Comprehensive monitoring** via Grafana dashboards and BigQuery analysis - **Systematic documentation** of all issues and resolutions [multiple references]## Risk Mitigation StatusThe team appears to be effectively managing risks through:- Real-time monitoring and alerting systems- Structured escalation processes with external partners- Comprehensive logging and audit trails- Regular sync calls with Flipkart technical teamsWhile the project faces operational challenges, the systematic approach to issue resolution and strong partner collaboration suggest the risks are being actively managed and contained.",
