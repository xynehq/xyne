    "Answer": "There are multiple performance metrics and targets being discussed across different documents, which could be the source of confusion. Here is a synthesis:\n\n1.  **Technical Specification (docId: 92c21f09dde340e1):** This document specifies two different metrics. It defines a rate limit of **10,000 requests per minute (RPM)** for the Data Ingestion Layer and a separate transaction throughput target of **10,000 transactions per second (TPS)** under 'Performance Metrics & Monitoring'.\n\n2.  **Email Communications (docId: 3365b739af4344f8):** In an email, Arjun Mehta mentions a potential discrepancy, stating, \"We're expecting **10k TPS**, but they've set it at **5k TPS**.\" This suggests that a 5k TPS limit is being negotiated with SISA, which is lower than the internal expectation.\n\n3.  **Slack Messages (docId: c9eb67faaa2b):** Divya Rao echoes this concern on Slack, saying, \"Good catch on the rate limits! We're definitely going to need more than **5k TPS**.\"\n\nIn summary, while the official specification document outlines a target of 10,000 TPS, internal discussions on email and Slack indicate that a lower limit of 5,000 TPS is currently being considered or proposed by the vendor, which the Juspay team sees as a point for negotiation.",

He explained that the seemingly small difference \"translates to about 43 minutes of additional downtime per month, which could impact our merchant partners significantly.\"\n\nThis topic was later flagged by Rohit Sharma (docId: 5f1d58e3bc104d6e) as an item that \"NEEDS ATTENTION,\" indicating it was a point of ongoing negotiation, likely due to cost implications mentioned by Karan Malhotra (docId: 3365b739af4344f8).",

To handle high-traffic scenarios, a distributed lock is used to ensure only one refresh request is made at a time.\n\n2.  **Retry Logic for Settlement:** The 2% variance tolerance for settlement reconciliation has been tested. It is considered a conservative buffer, as most discrepancies observed were under 0.5%. The buffer accounts for things like currency conversion fluctuations.\n\n3.  **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** The suggestion was accepted and is already being implemented using Hystrix. The configured behavior is for the circuit to open after 5 consecutive failures and reset after 30 seconds.",

An email from Neha Chopra (ID: 4562e570d8b941d1) provides the following resolutions:\n\n1.  **Concern:** What happens if the OAuth refresh token expires during a high-traffic period?\n    **Solution:** A proactive refresh mechanism has been implemented. It triggers when the token is within 10 minutes of expiration and uses a distributed lock to prevent multiple simultaneous refresh requests.\n\n2.  **Concern:** Has the retry logic been tested with the 2% variance tolerance for settlement reconciliation?\n    **Solution:** Yes, this has been tested. The 2% tolerance is considered conservative, as most discrepancies are under 0.5%.\n\n3.  **Concern:** Should a circuit breaker pattern be implemented for API calls?\n    **Solution:** Yes, this is already being implemented using Hystrix. The circuit will open after 5 consecutive failures and reset after 30 seconds.",

The 'Project Hyperion' PDF (815ebd8368ba4fa9) also mentions the system is designed to process 'over 5,000 transactions per second (TPS)'.\n*   **Specification (10,000 RPM):** The XML specification document (3f01f8f143bb47e9) provides a different metric, stating the rate limit is '10,000 requests per minute with burst capacity up to 15,000 RPM'.\n\nIn summary, while the design documents mention 5,000 TPS or 10,000 RPM, the team's stated expectation is 10,000 TPS, and this discrepancy is a key negotiation point marked as 'NEEDS ATTENTION' (email 6db8870caacc491f).",

It triggers when a token is within 10 minutes of expiration and uses a distributed lock to ensure only one refresh request is made at a time (email c3cb7ab5238b44b4).\n3.  **Comprehensive Retry Logic:** The system will use retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for API calls, as outlined in the risk mitigation sections of the project specifications (3f01f8f143bb47e9, 815ebd8368ba4fa9).\n4.  **Multi-Region Deployment:** To ensure high availability, the architecture plans for a multi-region deployment, as mentioned in the technical risk mitigation strategies (3f01f8f143bb47e9).",

Here is a summary of the resolutions:\n\n1.  **OAuth Token Refresh:** To handle token expiration during high traffic, a proactive refresh mechanism was implemented. It triggers when a token is within 10 minutes of expiration and uses a distributed lock to ensure only one refresh request is made at a time.\n2.  **Retry Logic:** The retry logic was confirmed to have been tested with a 2% variance tolerance for settlement reconciliation, which is considered a conservative buffer.\n3.  **API Resilience (Circuit Breaker):** The suggestion to implement a circuit breaker was adopted. The plan is to use Hystrix, configured to open the circuit after 5 consecutive failures and reset after 30 seconds.\n\nThese items were formally marked as 'APPROVED' to proceed with development (`4934b9bc4e9242e1`).",

    "Answer": "Based on recent emails and Slack messages, there are several technical concerns under discussion for the Project U-Switch integration:\n\n1.  **SLA Uptime:** Meera Reddy and Priya Nair suggested pushing for a 99.95% uptime commitment from NPCI instead of 99.9%, as the difference amounts to significant potential downtime for merchants. Rohit Sharma's email lists this as an item that 'NEEDS ATTENTION' to determine cost impact (email: 5130be1948034522, f6c2ada252844eab).\n\n2.  **API Rate Limits:** Vikram Singh noted that the API rate limits might be too restrictive (5k TPS) for Juspay's expected peak hours (10k TPS). Anjali Patel echoed this concern on Slack, suggesting it be escalated to the NPCI team. This is also marked as 'NEEDS ATTENTION' (email: 9a18ccea8f9f4082, slack: 8eb365c4a295).\n\n3.  **OAuth Token Refresh:** A question was raised about what happens if the refresh token expires during a high-traffic period. Vikram Singh clarified that a proactive refresh mechanism is implemented, which triggers when the token is within 10 minutes of expiration, using a distributed lock to prevent multiple requests (emails: 5130be1948034522, 9a18ccea8f9f4082).\n\n4.  **API Resilience:** The implementation of a circuit breaker pattern was suggested. This was confirmed to be in progress using Hystrix, which will open the circuit after 5 consecutive failures and reset after 30 seconds (emails: 5130be1948034522, 9a18ccea8f9f4082).\n\nThe general approach, recommended by Rohit Sharma, is to proceed with development on the approved items (OAuth, circuit breaker) while creating separate tickets to negotiate the items needing attention like the SLA and rate limits.",

    "Question": "There seems to be a discrepancy regarding the API rate limits for Project U-Switch. Can you synthesize the different figures mentioned across documents and conversations and explain the context of this issue?",

      "Factuality": 1,
      "Completeness": 1,
      "Domain_relevance": 1
    },
    "Answer": "Yes, there is a notable discrepancy in the data regarding API rate limits for Project U-Switch.\n\n1.  **Official Documentation:** The technical design documents (docId: 2a5a18d23d0a4341 and e54bda7b0b514fe7) specify the rate limit in the 'Data Ingestion Layer' as '10,000 requests per minute with burst capacity up to 15,000 RPM'. This translates to approximately 167 requests per second (RPS).\n\n2.  **Email & Slack Discussions:** In an email thread (mailId: 9a18ccea8f9f4082), Vikram Singh mentions a different figure, stating, 'I noticed the API rate limits in Doc#e54bda7b0b514fe7 might be too restrictive for our peak hours. We're expecting 10k TPS, but they've set it at 5k TPS.' This is echoed in a Slack message by Anjali Patel (docId: 8eb365c4a295), who agrees that 'more than 5k TPS' will be needed and suggests escalating to NPCI.\n\n**Inference & Context:** The discrepancy lies in both the unit (RPM vs. TPS) and the magnitude. The formal documents cite a much lower rate (10,000 RPM ≈ 167 TPS) than the figures being discussed informally (5,000-10,000 TPS). This suggests that the 5k TPS figure may have come from recent negotiations with NPCI, which conflicts with both the team's requirements (10k TPS) and the original design document. The issue is flagged as a point for negotiation.",
