    "Answer": "Based on the documents, there are two primary categories of risk: operational and security/compliance.\n\n1.  **Operational Risk:** Performance issues are causing refund settlement failures. This includes high latency and timeouts on two key API endpoints. Siddharth Nair's email (e970cd7622a546b6) reports that Flipkart's `/kyc/v3/verify` endpoint latency is spiking to over 4.5 seconds for high-risk users, leading to a 6.8% failure rate. Separately, Priya Nair's email (33d51709421142ac) notes that Juspay's own `/v2/risk/evaluate` endpoint latency spiked to over 2.5s, causing a 4.5% error rate. These failures jeopardize the T+1 settlement cycle mandated by RBI and require a non-sustainable manual fallback process.\n\n2.  **Security & Compliance Risk:** The file `49a3d287719c4892` details a critical PCI DSS 3.4 violation (tracked as JIRA PAY-9423) within the 'fk-refund-settlement-processor' service. The service's debug-level logs were capturing and persisting truncated PANs in plain text to an S3 bucket. This risk was compounded by an overly permissive IAM policy ('BroadS3Access-Legacy') attached to the service role.",

    "Answer": "According to the remediation plan (file# 49a3d287719c4892), the two immediate remediation steps are:\n\n1.  **Deploy Hotfix:** An emergency hotfix (version 1.7.1) must be deployed to update the 'log4j2.xml' configuration, elevating the log level for the 'in.juspay.settlement.flipkart' package from DEBUG to INFO in the production environment to stop the data leakage.\n\n2.  **Update IAM Role:** The DevOps team is mandated to create and apply a new, scoped-down IAM role, 'fk-settlement-s3-write-role', which restricts actions to 's3:PutObject' on the 's3://juspay-settlement-logs-prod/flipkart/*' prefix. This new role must replace the legacy 'BroadS3Access-Legacy' policy within 2 hours.",

    "Answer": "There are two distinct but related theories being investigated by different teams at Juspay:\n\n1.  **Siddharth Nair's Team (email e970cd7622a546b6):** Their investigation points to a performance issue on the **Flipkart side**. The specific endpoint being investigated is Flipkart's `/kyc/v3/verify`. The hypothesis is that a recent change in Flipkart's internal risk-scoring engine is causing processing delays for high-risk profiles. They have ruled out issues with their own OAuth token generation.\n\n2.  **Priya Nair's Team (email 33d51709421142ac):** This team is analyzing a latency spike in their own real-time risk scoring engine's endpoint, `/v2/risk/evaluate`. However, their working theory is that the root cause may be a **network-level delay or a bottleneck in JWT token management on Flipkart's side** before the request even reaches Juspay's infrastructure.",
