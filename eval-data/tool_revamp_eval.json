    },
    "Answer": "Based on recent communications, the primary risks to the RBI Data Localization program fall into four main categories:\n\n1.  **Data Residency Breaches:** Sensitive data is incorrectly crossing or being stored outside of designated boundaries. This has occurred due to a legacy routing rule in the `payment-router-v4` service incorrectly forwarding cross-border transactions (email 300389129c4e4801) and a separate incident where a faulty country-code mapping file caused international card data to be processed domestically (email 03100641e7f74098).\n\n2.  **Performance & Stability Issues:** Critical systems are not meeting performance SLAs, which jeopardizes audit requirements for system stability. This includes latency spikes in the real-time risk scoring engine due to inefficient database queries and TDE overhead (emails 4a93566dd1bc494d, cf8c739d62c54b90), and a performance bottleneck in the CBS migration staging environment causing high latency and transaction failures (email 937018d53a194020).\n\n3.  **Data Integrity & Reconciliation Gaps:** There are discrepancies and incomplete records in our transaction lifecycle. This is caused by `429 Too Many Requests` errors from NPCI leading to incomplete audit logs (email 29a95259663148b7), and multiple instances of settlement mismatches where transactions are missing from NPCI's final settlement files (emails 151c28ed781d480f, 487398a5ae2645ee).\n\n4.  **Security & Compliance Violations:** There are direct violations of security standards. An external auditor found unmasked Primary Account Numbers (PANs) being logged in plain text, violating PCI DSS Requirement 3.4, likely due to a race condition or configuration error in the `upi-transaction-processor` (email 3dcb009b0b164155).",
    "Confidence": 1,
    "Agentic_answer": "Based on the recent communications, I can identify the primary categories of technical and compliance risks facing the RBI Data Localization program:## **Primary Risk Categories**### **1. KYC Automation System Failures****Technical Issues:**- 40% drop in auto-verifications for high-risk customer segments - Automation failures specifically with NPCI integration for high-risk customers - Data enrichment step failures affecting verification pipeline **Root Causes:**- Confirmed issue on NPCI's side with vague ETA for resolution - System integration problems between internal KYC systems and NPCI - Manual fallbacks are not scalable or auditable solutions **Compliance Impact:**- Blocker for audit submission due to lack of scalable verification process - Risk to data integrity claims required for RBI compliance ### **2. OAuth Token and API Integration Failures****Technical Issues:**- Intermittent OAuth token refresh failures with NPCI causing API timeouts - Consistent timeouts on Euler gateway endpoints affecting transaction processing - Grafana showing error spikes every hour during token refresh cycles **Root Causes:**- OAuth token refresh mechanism failing at regular intervals - API timeout issues between internal systems and NPCI infrastructure **Compliance Impact:**- Data logging integrity checks compromised - Risk of transaction data loss or inconsistent state during failures - Jeopardizes audit timeline and data residency proof requirements ### **3. Performance and Latency Issues****Technical Issues:**- Real-time risk scoring engine latency spikes with p99 hitting ~450ms - Performance degradation when transaction volume increases - Core banking system migration creating performance bottlenecks **Root Causes:**- Fraud engine bottlenecks under high transaction loads - Core banking system migration impacting logging performance - Infrastructure not scaling properly with increased TPS **Compliance Impact:**- Performance deviations visible to NPCI flagged as audit risks - Cannot reliably prove data residency due to logging slowdowns - Undermines data residency claims for RBI compliance ### **4. Data Residency and Multi-Currency Settlement****Technical Issues:**- Multi-currency settlement optimization creating potential data residency ambiguities - Risk of data processing outside India during currency conversion **Root Causes:**- Complex settlement logic potentially creating data residency gaps - Unclear data flow during multi-currency processing **Compliance Impact:**- Critical requirement that all data points remain within India - NPCI has specific expectations for currency conversion data handling ## **Overall Program Impact**All issues are tracked under the main work ID `c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576` for the RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness Program. The combination of these technical failures creates significant compliance risks, with NPCI expressing concerns about the audit timeline and system stability. The program requires immediate attention to prevent audit failure and maintain regulatory compliance.",

The DevOps team rolled back this deployment, and monitoring confirmed that traffic has been routed correctly since. The next steps were a full audit of logs and implementing an automated pre-deployment check. (email 03100641e7f74098).\n\n3.  **Routing Failure due to Faulty Ruleset (JIRA PAY-2303):** A P0 incident where a faulty ruleset incorrectly forwarded transactions from international BINs to the domestic NPCI-UPI gateway, causing a near 100% failure rate with an `ERR_INVALID_ROUTING_TARGET` error.

    "Answer": "The core problem with the real-time risk scoring engine is a severe performance degradation, with p99 latency spiking from a baseline of ~150ms to over 800-920ms during peak loads. \n\nThe root cause is multifaceted but centers on database issues:\n*   **Inefficient Queries:** A new fraud ruleset introduced a complex, multi-table join query against a table (`transaction_metadata`) that lacks a necessary index, causing slow full table scans (email cf8c739d62c54b90).\n*   **Encryption Overhead:** The Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) layer, mandated for the audit, is introducing significant I/O overhead that wasn't captured in staging (email 4a93566dd1bc494d).\n*   **Scaling Issues:** The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for the service was configured to scale on CPU, but the bottleneck is I/O wait, leading to database connection pool exhaustion (email 4ba494bbcd5c4507).\n\nThe direct compliance impact is twofold: \n1.  **System Instability:** The high latency violates the audit's performance criteria for stable processing (event 55bef40cd55145a1).\n2.  **Incomplete Audit Trails:** The latency is causing the audit logging service to time out on some slow requests, creating data integrity gaps which is a direct violation of RBI guidelines (email cf8c739d62c54b90).\n\nMitigation strategies being pursued include:\n*   **Immediate:** Deploying a hotfix to increase the DB connection pool size and adjusting the HPA trigger to use CPU and memory (email 4ba494bbcd5c4507). Also, evaluating the temporary scaling of read replicas (email cf8c739d62c54b90).\n*   **Long-term:** Analyzing and adding a new indexing strategy for the problematic query (email cf8c739d62c54b90), optimizing data access logic, and exploring a more aggressive caching strategy via Redis (email 4a93566dd1bc494d).\n*   **Contingency:** A rollback plan for the new feature flag `risk-engine-dynamic-scoring-v2` is being prepared (event 55bef40cd55145a1).",

This would allow commits to proceed once the WAL is written to local memory, decoupling the process from disk flush latency. The document notes that the risk of data loss is minimal (<1 second) and acceptable for settlement reconciliation processes which have built-in idempotency .2. **Upgrade to Provisioned IOPS volumes**: The SRE team must initiate a procurement and testing cycle for Provisioned IOPS (io2 Block Express) volumes for the WAL partition, aiming for a baseline of 20,000 IOPS .Both changes were required to be validated in the pre-production environment against the `RBI-Audit-Sim-v2` test plan by EOD Friday .The document explains that the root cause was I/O contention on the primary database node, specifically related to the `synchronous_commit = 'on'` configuration, where each transaction commit was waiting for the WAL record to be flushed to the gp3 EBS volume before acknowledging the write to the Kafka consumer .",

    "Answer": "Based on the documents, there are several significant challenges with the UPI LITE X integration:\n\n1.  **PCI-DSS Compliance:** Multiple audit findings have been reported. \n    - **PII Logging (PCI-DSS 10.2.5):** Unmasked PII (`payerVpa`, `payeeVpa`) is being logged in Redis. An immediate fix involves a Redis Lua script for masking, while a permanent solution involves a new Kafka topic (`upi-lite-x-log-sanitize-queue`) and a `log-sanitizer` service (doc: 9fb507c7df7f498b).\n    - **Data-at-Rest Security (PCI DSS 4.0):** Use of a deprecated cipher suite (TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA) for on-device payload storage. The plan is to mandate an update to TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (doc: 736bbd7bfd034c6e).\n    - **Key Management (PCI DSS 3.5.1):** The process for managing cryptographic keys for on-device cached data is under scrutiny. A proposed solution is to use envelope encryption with a hardware-backed keystore (docs: 399949980b7e4649, 91abb9672b89424e).\n\n2.  **Performance Degradation:** Post CBS-migration, p99 latency has severely degraded.\n    - In pre-prod, latency jumped to ~600ms (SLA 250ms). A short-term fix is to increase the DB connection pool by 30%, with a long-term plan to profile and optimize queries (doc: e477aa63a0df44ee).\n    - In another instance, latency jumped to over 1.8s (baseline ~400ms) due to `ConnectionPoolTimeoutException` errors. The immediate fix was a 50% increase in max connections for the `euler-prod-rds` cluster (doc: 87317e138721418c).\n\n3.  **KYC Automation Failures:** There's a high failure rate for high-risk customer segments, with error codes like `K51`, `KYC_DATA_MISMATCH`, and `U34`. The issue has been escalated to NPCI for investigation into their backend logic and validation rules, as it's a blocker for onboarding and compliance (docs: 852ac31bb31646dc, 1f6b31906da6463f, 0fb92fe4dce04702, 7651e3bd6b094614).\n\n4.  **OAuth Token Refresh Failures:** Multiple incidents of API timeouts are traced to failures in the OAuth 2.0 token refresh flow, with `invalid_grant` and `HTTP 503` errors from NPCI's UAT environment. A temporary hotfix using a Redis-based distributed lock has been deployed, with a permanent centralized token management service being designed (docs: 62f4b1e407154aa8, a2044f491004408e, 70c4be9e2e384ef4).",

PCI Compliance Finding (Critical Priority)**- NPCI has flagged a critical PCI compliance finding (ID 173224) related to offline transaction signing - This is considered a potential blocker for the project launch - The finding has been logged in JIRA PAY-2951 - Another PCI audit finding (ID 113201) has been identified as a showstopper for the UPI LITE X rollout - The compliance team needs a remediation plan by EOD ## Major Technical Challenges**1. Rate Limiting and Throughput Issues**- NPCI gateway is throttling requests well below the agreed-upon TPS (transactions per second) - This appears to be caused by aggressive new firewall rules for the offline payment flow - The issue is being tracked in JIRA PAY-3796 - NPCI is calling current limits \"provisional limits\" during the UAT phase, impacting transaction success rates **2. Cross-Border Payment Routing Issues**- Confirmed configuration issue on NPCI's end affecting cross-border payments - Specific failure ID 701756 has been identified in logs - No firm ETA provided for the fix, creating pressure for project launch - Tracked in JIRA PAY-6494 **3. Settlement and Reconciliation Problems**- Settlement file discrepancies and reconciliation failures - Batch processing lags in NPCI's system affecting settlement accuracy - Multiple batch IDs affected (953502, 928376) - Tracked in JIRA PAY-9769 and PAY-1759 **4. Performance and Latency Issues**- NPCI's real-time risk scoring engine getting overloaded during stress tests - P95 latency jumping to ~800ms, well outside SLA requirements - OAuth token refresh failures causing API timeouts - Tracked in JIRA PAY-5627 and PAY-2051 ## Steps Being Taken to Address These Issues**Immediate Actions:**- Direct communication channels opened with NPCI contacts for urgent escalation - All issues formally tracked in JIRA with specific ticket numbers [2-12]- Regular sync meetings scheduled (4 PM syncs mentioned) - Stress testing and monitoring through Grafana dashboards **Collaborative Efforts:**- Team Euler engagement for technical input on compliance issues - Cross-functional collaboration between compliance, development, and integration teams - Direct calls with NPCI technical teams for issue resolution **Timeline and Escalation:**- NPCI has committed to deploying fixes to sandbox environment - Remediation plans required by EOD for compliance issues - High-visibility tracking due to partnership impact and merchant dependencies The project appears to be under significant pressure with multiple P0 (highest priority) issues that could potentially block the launch if not resolved quickly.",

    "Answer": "Yes, there are multiple documented instances of OAuth 2.0 token refresh failures with the NPCI UAT environment. \n\n**Pattern of Failure:** The issue manifests as a sharp increase in API timeouts and `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` responses. This happens when our services attempt to use a valid refresh token at NPCI's `/token` endpoint but receive an `{\"error\":\"invalid_grant\"}` payload or an `HTTP 503 Service Unavailable` response. This directly causes downstream transaction calls to fail and latency to spike, with observed p99 latency going from ~200-250ms to over 2350ms-4500ms (docs: 5a51c6e6d9024073, 70c4be9e2e384ef4, a2044f491004408e).\n\n**Identified Root Cause:** The internal analysis suggests a race condition within our token management logic. When a JWT is nearing expiry, multiple concurrent payment processing threads attempt to trigger the refresh flow simultaneously. The first request succeeds and invalidates the refresh token, but subsequent near-simultaneous requests from other threads fail because they are using the now-stale refresh token (doc: 62f4b1e407154aa8).\n\n**Solutions:**\n*   **Immediate Mitigation:** A hotfix has been deployed to the staging environment that implements a Redis-based distributed lock around the token refresh function. This ensures only one process can initiate a refresh at a time, preventing the race condition (doc: 62f4b1e407154aa8).\n*   **Long-Term Solution:** A more robust, centralized token management service is being designed. To finalize this, the team is seeking clarification from NPCI on their `refresh_token` invalidation policy (i.e., if it's invalidated immediately upon first use) (doc: 62f4b1e407154aa8).",

    "Answer": "Yes, we are experiencing persistent and escalating KYC automation failures for high-risk customer segments when interacting with NPCI's APIs for the UPI LITE X integration.\n\nInitially, we saw an 18.5% failure rate with a `K51` (KYC Validation Failed) error, which was suspected to be a timeout or bottleneck on NPCI's side (doc: 852ac31bb31646dc). Further investigation confirmed the error was an immediate application-level rejection, not a timeout. The error code `K51` was clarified as 'Invalid Customer Risk Profile' (doc: 1f6b31906da6463f).\n\nIn a later incident, a 42% failure rate was observed in the UAT environment with the error code `KYC_DATA_MISMATCH` and the message 'Advanced risk profile validation failed' from the `/v2/kyc/verify` endpoint (doc: 0fb92fe4dce04702).\n\nMost recently, a 12-14% failure rate was reported with `Error Code: U34 (Invalid Customer Profile)` from the `/customer/verify/v2` endpoint. This is particularly concerning because the same profiles pass verification when checked manually via the NPCI partner portal (doc: 7651e3bd6b094614).\n\nIn all cases, we have escalated to NPCI, requesting they investigate their backend processing logic, provide server-side logs, and clarify any undocumented validation rules for high-risk segments.",

    "Agentic_answer": "Based on the search results from the CENGINEERING Slack channel, here's what's happening with the KYC verification issues:## Current Status of KYC Issues with NPCI**Yes, there are ongoing KYC automation failures specifically affecting high-risk users**, and this is a critical issue for the company's RBI Data Localization audit readiness. Here's the breakdown:### The Problem- **KYC automation is failing exclusively for high-risk customer segments** - **NPCI is reporting validation errors** on their side when processing requests for these users - The issue appears to be related to **how unique identifiers are being passed** for certain users (e.g., unique_id: 543927) ### Root Cause AnalysisMultiple technical issues have been identified:1. **NPCI-side validation changes**: NPCI deployed new validation rules that are misclassifying KYC payloads for high-risk users 2. **Timeout issues**: The fraud-engine is timing out when scoring high-risk customer profiles, causing downstream KYC failures 3. **Data schema mismatches**: Potential data schema issues post-localization 4. **Request payload problems**: NPCI suspects the fraud-engine is sending payloads their system can't parse ### Current Actions Being Taken- **NPCI is doing emergency rollbacks** of their problematic validation rules - **Joint debugging sessions** are being scheduled between the teams - **Multiple JIRA tickets** are tracking different aspects: PAY-5011, PAY-5318, PAY-4049, PAY-9542, PAY-8054, PAY-6304, PAY-6182, PAY-8108, PAY-6973, PAY-9493, PAY-8138 ### ImpactThis is a **major blocker for the RBI Data Localization audit readiness program** and could impact the UPI Lite X offline payments launch .

    "Question": "Considering the API rate limits being imposed by NPCI and the separate issue of settlement mismatches due to transaction status lookup failures, what is the combined operational risk for meeting our T+1 settlement compliance?",

      "Factuality": 1,
      "Completeness": 1,
      "Domain_relevance": 1
    },
    "Answer": "The combined operational risk to T+1 settlement compliance is significant due to two distinct but potentially compounding issues:\n\n1.  **Settlement Mismatches:** Transactions that time out at the `/pay` API are later polled using the `/getStatus` API. However, this endpoint has been returning `T04 - Transaction not found` for transactions that were successfully processed by NPCI. This causes our system to incorrectly mark them as 'Failed', leading to a desynchronization and settlement shortfall (e.g., ₹42,157.50 for batch `STL-20240610-ULX-45B`). This directly poses an operational risk to settlement compliance per RBI guidelines (doc: 803b085816424896).\n\n2.  **API Rate Limiting:** NPCI is throttling our UAT requests on endpoints like `/v2/payment/initiate` at ~80 TPS, causing `HTTP 429` errors. This prevents us from conducting load tests at the required scale (requested 200-300 TPS) to ensure system stability for projected Day 1 volume (doc: b95e9d3e8eac41e4).\n\n**Combined Risk:** If the rate-limiting issue persists in production, it could increase the frequency of timeouts at the `/pay` API during peak loads. This would, in turn, exacerbate the settlement mismatch problem, as more transactions would enter the problematic 'Pending' state. A higher volume of status lookups could also be throttled, further delaying reconciliation and increasing the risk of significant, unmanageable settlement discrepancies, thereby jeopardizing our ability to consistently meet the T+1 compliance mandate.",
    "Confidence": 1,
    "Agentic_answer": "Based on the context fragments and search results, I can assess the combined operational risk to T+1 settlement compliance from NPCI API rate limits and settlement mismatches. Here's my analysis:## Combined Operational Risk Assessment for T+1 Settlement ComplianceThe NPCI API rate limiting and settlement mismatch issues present **significant combined operational risks** that could directly impact your organization's ability to meet T+1 settlement compliance requirements:### Critical Risk Factors:**1. NPCI API Rate Limiting Impact:**- Rate limiting is causing transaction **throughput to be throttled**, preventing reliable data processing - **Transactions are being dropped** during peak processing periods, creating gaps in the settlement pipeline - The payment-gateway is experiencing **consistent throttling errors** that impact transaction success rates - This directly threatens the ability to **process all transactions within the T+1 window****2. Settlement Mismatch Issues:**- **Settlement mismatches with unique ID 828891** are tied to timestamp logging issues in the payment-gateway before batching for settlement - UPI LITE X offline transactions are showing as **successful in payment-gateway logs but missing from final NPCI settlement files** - There are **gaps in the audit trail** where transactions appear processed internally but don't reach settlement ### Combined Operational Risk:**HIGH RISK** - The combination creates a **compounding failure scenario**:1. **Processing Bottleneck**: API rate limits reduce transaction throughput, creating backlogs that may not clear within T+1 timeframes 2. **Data Integrity Issues**: Settlement mismatches mean even successfully processed transactions may not reconcile properly, requiring manual intervention that extends beyond T+1 windows 3. **Compliance Exposure**: Both issues are flagged as major risks for RBI Data Localization audits, indicating regulatory concern about operational resilience 4. **Audit Trail Gaps**: Missing or mismatched transaction records make it difficult to prove T+1 compliance during regulatory reviews ### Immediate Actions Required:- **Escalate with NPCI** for formal rate limit increases (tickets 652436, PAY-6408, PAY-2204) - **Complete RCA** on settlement timestamp logging issues (JIRA PAY-4362) - **Implement monitoring** to ensure no transaction data is lost during API throttling events - **Develop contingency plans** for manual settlement processing if automated systems fail to meet T+1 deadlinesThe risk level is **elevated to critical** given that both issues could simultaneously impact different stages of the settlement pipeline, creating multiple points of failure within the T+1 compliance window.",

    "Answer": "Based on documents 0cf90ecc5cb54b45 and b1ced9640b604a7f, there are two distinct fraud model issues:\n\n1.  **High False Positive Rate (per Rohit's email):** A new, unnamed fraud model has a false positive rate of 4.2%, far exceeding the <1.0% threshold. This is impacting the `/v2/mandate/create` endpoint by being overly sensitive to new device fingerprints. The proposed solutions are a partial rollback via a canary release and a re-evaluation of the model's feature weights. This is tracked in JIRA PAY-3024.\n\n2.  **High-Velocity Mandate Drops (per the mitigation plan file):** The `MandateVelocityScorer-v2` model is causing a 12% increase in transaction drops with the error code `FRM-802: High-Velocity Mandate`. The root cause is an overly sensitive `vpa_velocity_threshold` and disproportionate weighting for `device_fingerprint_entropy`. The immediate solution is a hotfix to adjust the trigger threshold from 0.85 to 0.95, followed by a model retraining cycle. This is related to JIRA PAY-4973.",

    "Agentic_answer": "Based on the available context from the Slack conversations in the CENGINEERING channel, I can synthesize the fraud detection model issues. Here's a comprehensive analysis:## Two Distinct Problems### Problem 1: Internal Fraud-Engine False Positives**Nature**: The company's internal fraud-engine model has become too aggressive, causing a spike in false positive rates .**Metrics/Error Codes**:- False positive rate hovering around **3.2%** for ICICI cross-border flows - Error code **618950** identified in Grafana logs - Rule set **525322** specifically causing issues - **~12% jump** in false positive rate on primary model **Impact**: - Spike in manual review tickets - Bloated manual review queue - Drop in transaction success rates - Risk for NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit ### Problem 2: ICICI Bank's External Fraud Detection Model**Nature**: ICICI Bank's new fraud detection model is also too aggressive, blocking legitimate transactions .**Metrics/Error Codes**:- Transaction ID **317103** cited as example - Surge in false positives from ICICI's end ## Models Involved1. **Internal fraud-engine model** - Company's primary fraud detection system 2. **ICICI Bank's fraud detection model** - External partner's system 3. **Primary model** affecting UPI transactions ## Proposed Solutions### For Internal Fraud-Engine:1. **Model tuning/retraining** - Get DS team to retrain or roll back the model update 2. **Rule-based fixes** - Address rule-tuning issues rather than the model itself 3. **Model sensitivity adjustment** - Tweak the model's sensitivity parameters 4. **Rollback consideration** - Consider rolling back the model temporarily ### For ICICI Bank Model:1. **Partner coordination** - ICICI is rolling back their model change with ~2 hours ETA 2. **Monitoring** - Keep eye on fraud-engine Grafana dashboard to track improvements ## Regulatory/Audit ConcernsBoth problems are critical because they impact:- **NPCI UPI Ecosystem Security Audit** - **RBI Data Localization Audit** - **NPCI Data Localization Audit** The issues are tracked across multiple JIRA tickets including PAY-2838, PAY-9096, PAY-5789, PAY-2608, PAY-8494, PAY-9426, PAY-9392, PAY-8478, PAY-2861, PAY-9113, and PAY-4333 .",

Several key aspects are currently being addressed:### Compliance Requirements- **Data Residency**: All payment data from Indian customers must remain within India during processing, including currency conversion and settlement legs - **NPCI Audit Focus**: This is a major focus area for the upcoming NPCI data localization audit - **Fast-tracked Priority**: The optimization work has been fast-tracked due to NPCI's urgent requirements ### Current Issues Identified- **Settlement File Format**: NPCI's current settlement files lack fields for source currency information - **Forex Conversion Reporting**: Specific format requirements for forex conversion reporting in settlement files - **Reconciliation Challenges**: The proposed workarounds (using 'remarks' field) may break reconciliation logic ## Specific Items Needed from NPCI### 1. Formal Specification Updates- **Updated settlement file specification** with proper currency fields instead of using generic 'remarks' field - **Detailed data flows** for multi-currency processing that comply with data residency requirements ### 2. Sandbox Access and Testing- **Sandbox access** scheduled for \"next Wednesday\" to test new settlement flows - **Formal approval** of proposed optimization flows (NPCI ref ID 984294) ### 3. Documentation and References- **Specific expectations document** (ref ID 837775) that NPCI has already shared - **Formal requirements** currently tracked as NPCI internal ID 175509 - **Updated specifications** for requirement ID 741417 related to forex transaction data residency ### 4. Process Clarifications- **Confirmation** that NPCI's settlement engine can handle multi-currency batching for offline payments - **Approved alternative flows** if direct multi-currency support isn't available The issue is currently tracked across multiple JIRA tickets (PAY-4713, PAY-8973, PAY-9159, PAY-6570, and others) and involves multiple work IDs, indicating this is a complex, organization-wide initiative that requires immediate attention to meet audit deadlines.",

    "Answer": "Synthesizing information from multiple emails reveals several recurring challenges with the OAuth 2.0 and JWT token flows:\n\n1.  **Token Introspection Bottlenecks:** The authentication service itself became a bottleneck, slowing down to validate JWT tokens and causing a major latency spike in the risk scoring engine (email a5f262d5d63e4011, JIRA PAY-4155).\n2.  **Token Generation Failures:** A service misconfiguration prevented the initiation of the OAuth 2.0 flow, leading to a failure to generate valid JWT tokens for non-INR transactions (email ee7a1feed503420e, JIRA PAY-9952).\n3.  **Faulty JWT Claims:** A separate incident involved a faulty JWT claim that failed to correctly differentiate between domestic and international mandates, causing a critical compliance breach by misrouting transactions (email b0bc09865e2f4193, JIRA PAY-3503).\n4.  **Token Refresh Failures:** The system intermittently failed to refresh JWT access tokens before they expired, causing HTTP 401 \"Invalid Token\" errors and API timeouts for merchants (email be334e26a6a040d1, JIRA PAY-8439).",

    "Agentic_answer": "Based on the comprehensive communications analysis from multiple sources, here are the recurring technical challenges related to authentication and authorization in the UPI Mandate project:## Key Authentication & Authorization Challenges### 1. **OAuth Token Management Issues**The most persistent challenge involves OAuth token refresh failures causing API timeouts . Specifically:- OAuth token refresh logic failures on ICICI's end causing API timeouts across the entire UPI AutoPay mandate flow - Consistent 401 unauthorized errors from ICICI endpoints due to OAuth token refresh failures - These failures require certificate re-verification and escalation to ICICI technical teams### 2. **PCI Compliance Violations in Authentication Logging**Critical security findings around sensitive data handling :- Logging sensitive authentication parameters in plaintext during mandate creation callbacks - PCI audit findings becoming critical blockers requiring immediate hotfixes - Token handling configurations requiring urgent fixes before deployment - Multiple PCI audit findings (IDs: 230427, 544660, 497285, 360236) all related to authentication data exposure### 3. **API Rate Limiting and Access Control**Authentication-related performance bottlenecks :- API rate limiting on ICICI's end causing `429 Too Many Requests` errors - Payment gateway experiencing timeouts due to rate limiting on specific mandates- Need for projected peak TPS data to increase authentication rate caps### 4. **Fraud Engine Authentication Conflicts**Authorization logic causing false positives :- Fraud engine being overly aggressive and incorrectly flagging legitimate mandates - KYC automation failures for high-risk customers due to aggressive fraud detection - Risk scoring latency spikes (p99 hitting ~450ms) in fraud engine authentication flows ### 5. **Settlement and Reconciliation Authentication Issues**Backend authentication problems affecting transaction finalization :- Missing final ACK from ICICI for transaction batches due to authentication timeouts - Recon API timing out during settlement processes- BigQuery showing correct file transmission but authentication failures on ICICI's reconciliation API## Impact and Resolution PatternsThese authentication and authorization challenges consistently:- Block UAT sign-offs and production readiness- Require immediate escalation to ICICI technical teams- Need joint technical calls for resolution- Are tracked across multiple JIRA tickets (PAY-8118, PAY-4126, PAY-7518, PAY-2862, PAY-8610, etc.)- Threaten project timelines for the UPI AutoPay Mandate integration (work ID: a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001)The pattern shows that authentication and authorization issues are the primary technical blockers requiring urgent, coordinated resolution between internal teams and ICICI Bank's technical infrastructure.",

    "Answer": "The performance issues in the UAT environment stem from several distinct technical problems identified across various communications:\n1.  **OAuth Token Refresh Failures:** Multiple emails and Slack messages (e.g., `3a5231b729744b54`, `5a51c6e6d9024073`, `62f4b1e407154aa8`) report that the OAuth 2.0 token refresh mechanism is failing, leading to `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` and `invalid_grant` errors, which cause downstream API timeouts. A race condition in Juspay's token management logic was identified as a likely cause.\n2.  **CBS Migration Bottleneck:** A partner bank's Core Banking System (CBS) migration has caused significant latency spikes. P99 latency jumped to over 1,800ms on endpoints like `/v2/pay/offline/transact`, leading to `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` errors. This is discussed in emails (`9418f17b07494327`, `0c433155e0be4149`) and is the subject of calendar invites (`e477aa63a0df44ee`, `87317e138721418c`). The root cause is suspected to be database connection pool exhaustion.\n3.  **API Rate Limiting:** Slack messages (`f47741f54c274173`, `58d3757289194772`) and an email (`b95e9d3e8eac41e4`) confirm that NPCI's sandbox environment is rate-limiting Juspay's API calls, resulting in `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors and throttling throughput to around 80 TPS.",

    "Agentic_answer": "Based on my analysis of the emails, Slack messages, and related communications, I can identify several distinct technical problems causing API timeouts and performance degradation in the UAT environment. Here's a comprehensive synthesis:## Core Technical Problems Identified### 1. **OAuth Token Refresh Failures (NPCI Integration)****Root Cause**: OAuth 2.0 token refresh endpoint failures in NPCI's UAT environment - **Symptoms**: - Connection timeouts after 1500ms threshold when attempting `grant_type=refresh_token` flow - `401 Unauthorized` responses with `invalid_grant` error codes - P99 latency spike from ~250ms to over 2800ms for payment initiation calls - API error rate climbing to ~18% during testing periods- **Impact**: Blocking UPI LITE X integration testing (Work ID: 04da84ad-10cc-4e23-b547-2eb09883fb5a) - **Technical Details**: JWT access tokens expire after 60 minutes, but subsequent refresh attempts fail despite valid refresh tokens### 2. **Core Banking System (CBS) Migration Impact****Root Cause**: Recent CBS migrations at partner banks causing downstream bottlenecks - **Symptoms**: - P99 latency degradation from ~250ms to 1,950ms on `/collect.pay` endpoint - Transaction throughput ceiling at 9,500 TPS vs target of 25,000 TPS - Error rate increase to 3.8% with `U91 (Downstream System Timeout)` errors - `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` responses from newly migrated systems- **Impact**: Affecting multiple integrations including UPI LITE X and ICICI integrations- **Technical Context**: Legacy core systems unable to handle concurrent request volumes required for real-time transaction monitoring### 3. **API Rate Limiting Issues****Root Cause**: Inadequate rate limits in UAT environments for production-level testing - **ICICI UAT Environment**: - Hard ceiling at ~40 TPS vs required 150 TPS for testing - `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` with error code `E012:TPS_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` - P99 latency spike from 450ms to over 2.5s before timeouts - 65% failure rate during peak load simulation- **Technical Impact**: Cannot validate system stability under RBI mandate requirements### 4. **External API Performance Degradation****Root Cause**: Severe latency issues with external bank APIs - **ICICI Risk Scoring Engine**: - P99 latency spike from ~200ms to over 2.1s on `enrichment-v2` endpoint - Round-trip times fluctuating to 1.9s for external calls - No correlation with transaction volume (15k TPS well below limits)- **Transaction Enrichment APIs**: - P99 latency exceeding 2.5s on `/v2/enrichTransaction` endpoint - 4.5% error rate with `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout` responses - Well outside 400ms SLA agreements### 5. **Infrastructure Scaling Issues Post-Migration****Root Cause**: Misconfigured or undersized infrastructure in new CBS environments - **Symptoms**: - Database contention and connection pool exhaustion - Kubernetes pod resource constraints in partner environments - Network configuration issues affecting service-to-service communication- **Evidence**: Internal Juspay systems showing healthy metrics while external calls fail## Cross-Cutting Technical Patterns1. **Authentication Layer Instability**: OAuth flows failing across multiple partner integrations2. **Legacy System Integration Challenges**: New CBS systems struggling with modern API load patterns3. **Inadequate UAT Environment Provisioning**: Rate limits and resource allocation insufficient for realistic testing4. **Monitoring Gaps**: Partners lacking visibility into their own system bottlenecks during high-load scenarios## Business ImpactThese technical issues are creating compliance risks with RBI mandates, blocking production readiness sign-offs, and threatening project timelines across multiple critical integrations including UPI LITE X, ICICI AutoPay, and cross-border reporting systems.The problems appear systemic rather than isolated, suggesting broader infrastructure readiness issues across the partner ecosystem following recent technology migrations.",

Remediation involves NPCI patching the endpoint and an immediate hotfix to the 'gringotts-reconciliation' service to mask this data in logs (docIds: 370cb531604843d9, 736bbd7bfd034c6e).\n2.  **Deprecated Cipher Suite (Data-at-Rest):** The on-device encrypted payload storage was using the deprecated `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA` cipher suite. Remediation is a mandatory POS application update to enforce the use of the `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` cipher suite (docId: 736bbd7bfd034c6e).\n3.  **Replay Attack Vector:** Messages on the 'upi-lite-x-offline-sync' Kafka topic lacked a unique hardware identifier. Remediation is to version the data contract and prepend the device's SecureElementID to each message key (docId: 736bbd7bfd034c6e).\n4.  **Insecure Key Management (Req 3.5.1):** The on-device cache for offline transactions uses a locally derived symmetric key, which auditors flagged as potentially non-compliant with key lifecycle requirements for Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD). The proposed remediation is to update the SDK to use envelope encryption with a master key from a hardware-backed keystore (docIds: 399949980b7e4649, 91abb9672b89424e).",

Examples include the fraud-engine latency shooting up to ~800ms (ed47e893ba334ef2), the reporting job latency exceeding 3500ms (8f4619b333d84b20), the `/v2/reporting/submitTransaction` endpoint spiking over 2500ms (1b5f22de924c41f7), and the risk scoring engine reaching peaks of 2.1s - 2.5s (af21de763e194c6f, c49c9386a827454b, d944a014cdff47b3).\n\n2.  **API Timeouts & Errors:** These latency spikes lead to various errors, including `504 Gateway Timeout` (8f4619b333d84b20, 6a7f1318c0d44857), `HTTP 408` timeouts (1b5f22de924c41f7), and `502 Bad Gateway` (0de0f0d953f74e29).\n\n3.  **Authentication Failures:** A core problem is the intermittent failure of the OAuth 2.0 token refresh mechanism with ICICI's auth service, leading to `401 Unauthorized` errors when the expired JWT is used (1b5f22de924c41f7, 26ebcc9f99264694, a851b7621c75429e).\n\n4.  **Rate Limiting:** Multiple reports confirm that ICICI's API is aggressively rate-limiting requests, resulting in `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors. This has been observed on endpoints like `/v2/transactions/crossborder/report` and the general reporting API, capping throughput at levels like 100 TPS or 50 TPS, which is insufficient for peak loads (b9bdb929590f4651, c02e9d35a7c34eea, 04982eb4c12449c7, c5703a709a364197).\n\n5.  **High False Positive Rates:** The fraud detection model is showing a high false positive rate, spiking to 4.2% or 4.6%, which is an order of magnitude higher than the baseline (8ad3c03220fa42fe, 40f0f642de844ac5, 27b169973c1a46e4).",

    "Agentic_answer": "Based on the comprehensive analysis of emails and Slack messages regarding ICICI integration performance issues, here's a synthesis of the recurring problems and metrics:## **Recurring Performance Problems**### **1. Latency Spikes**The most consistent issue across all integrations is severe latency degradation:- **P99 latency** consistently spiking from healthy baselines (~180ms-450ms) to **2.2-2.5 seconds** - **API endpoints affected**: `/mandate/create`, `/creditline/debit`, `/v2/transaction/risk_score`, `/fsp-enrichment-v3` - **OAuth token refresh** latency remaining stable (~45-80ms), isolating issues to ICICI's backend systems ### **2. High Error Rates**Significant increases in transaction failures:- **Error rates** jumping from baseline **0.1-0.3%** to **3.5-5%** during incidents - **Primary error types**: `HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout`, `HTTP 503 Service Unavailable`, ICICI's proprietary error codes like `E012:TPS_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` - **Authentication failures**: `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` during token refresh cycles ### **3. Throughput Limitations**Severe restrictions on transaction processing capacity:- **Rate limiting**: Systems throttled at **40 TPS** when testing requires **150-200 TPS** - **Load test failures**: Unable to sustain even **500-75 TPS** in UAT environments - **Production impact**: Risk of not meeting **99.95% uptime SLA** and RBI processing mandates ## **Root Cause Analysis**### **Primary Issue: ICICI Core Banking System Migration**All performance degradations correlate with ICICI's core banking system migration:- **Migration impact**: New backend systems unable to handle concurrent request volumes - **Infrastructure under-provisioning**: Database contention or under-provisioned Kubernetes clusters suspected - **Legacy system integration**: New monitoring services struggling with legacy core system connections ### **Specific Technical Issues**1. **OAuth Token Management**: Refresh token validation failures causing cascading authentication issues 2. **API Gateway Bottlenecks**: ICICI's API gateway experiencing resource exhaustion 3. **Database Query Optimization**: Suspected performance issues in ICICI's transaction processing logic ## **Impact on Business Operations**### **Compliance Risks**- **RBI Mandate Violations**: Risk of breaching T+1 reporting windows and real-time processing requirements - **Audit Trail Compromises**: Failed transactions affecting SOC 2 compliance and regulatory submission integrity - **NPCI Guidelines**: Potential breach of transaction success rate requirements [Slack messages]### **Project Delays**Multiple work IDs affected:- **a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001**: UPI AutoPay Mandate Integration - **c41b28d6-dfc2-41b1-8653-22b4d7479603**: RBI Cross-Border Reporting - **a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41**: UPI Credit Line Integration - **6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3**: RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring ## **Consistent Monitoring Metrics**### **Performance Indicators**- **Grafana Dashboards**: Consistent monitoring across `ICICI-UAT-Performance`, `payments-latency-icici-staging` - **Internal Processing**: Juspay's systems maintaining healthy performance (45-120ms internal processing) - **External Dependency**: All bottlenecks isolated to ICICI's API responses ### **Error Tracking**- **JIRA Tickets**: Multiple high‑priority tickets created (PAY-5618, PAY-1494, PAY-9143, etc.) - **Kibana Logs**: Comprehensive error correlation and trace ID tracking ## **Mitigation Strategies**### **Immediate Actions**- **Circuit Breakers**: Implemented to prevent cascading failures - **Timeout Adjustments**: Increased connection thresholds as temporary fixes - **Load Balancing**: Kubernetes auto‑scaling confirmed functional on Juspay's side ## **Required ICICI Actions**- **Infrastructure Scaling**: Urgent need for capacity increases in UAT/production environments - **Root Cause Analysis**: Formal RCA required for core banking system performance - **SLA Restoration**: Return to contractual performance levels (<400-500ms P99 latency) The consistent pattern shows that while Juspay's internal systems remain healthy and performant, ICICI's post‑migration infrastructure is the primary bottleneck across all integration projects, creating significant compliance and business continuity risks.",

      "Completeness": 1,
      "Domain_relevance": 1
    },
    "Answer": "Based on the documents, the primary risks to the project and their proposed mitigations are:\n\n1.  **Risk: OAuth Token Refresh Failures:** Intermittent timeouts and failures in ICICI's OAuth token refresh flow are causing `401 Unauthorized` errors and data submission gaps.\n    *   **Proposed Mitigation:** Implement a proactive, stateful token management strategy by running a scheduled background task to refresh the token 15 minutes before expiry and storing it in Redis (8f4619b333d84b20). A more aggressive 5-minute proactive refresh was also suggested (26ebcc9f99264694). Additionally, a Hystrix circuit breaker was recommended to halt the queue after consecutive failures (8f4619b333d84b20).\n\n2.  **Risk: API Rate Limiting:** ICICI is enforcing aggressive rate limits (e.g., 50-100 TPS) that are insufficient for peak loads, causing `429 Too Many Requests` errors and creating a reporting backlog.\n    *   **Proposed Mitigation:** Formally escalate to ICICI to increase the throughput cap to the agreed-upon level (e.g., 500 or 600 TPS) (b9bdb929590f4651, c02e9d35a7c34eea). Internally, suggestions include implementing an exponential backoff strategy or a circuit breaker (c02e9d35a7c34eea, 04982eb4c12449c7).\n\n3.  **Risk: High Fraud Model False Positives:** The fraud detection model is overly aggressive for cross-border transactions, with false positive rates spiking to over 4%, causing legitimate transactions to be blocked and creating a manual review backlog.\n    *   **Proposed Mitigation:** Investigate the data mapping layer, retrain the model with new purpose codes, run the model in shadow mode to gather data, or perform a targeted rollback of the most aggressive rules (40f0f642de844ac5, 6810f697565243e6). Another suggestion was to adjust the weights for specific rules like `CS_INTL_Vel_003` (8ad3c03220fa42fe).\n\n4.  **Risk: PCI DSS Compliance Violations:** An audit found two critical issues: JWT tokens with a 24-hour expiry (violating Requirement 8.3.10) and the logging of unmasked PAN in error responses from ICICI's UAT environment (violating Requirement 3.4).\n    *   **Proposed Mitigation:** Request ICICI to reduce the token lifetime to the mandated 1 hour (f2ceae5c3b42484b). For the PAN logging, the plan is to demand an urgent patch from ICICI and investigate a temporary sanitization layer in Juspay's API gateway as a mitigating control (57af6ab4bc844546).",

    "Answer": "The KYC automation process for high‑risk customers is facing multiple, varied issues, indicating a complex problem rather than a single root cause:\n\n*   **Varying Error Rates & Codes:** Different reports cite different failure rates (4.8%, 17.8%, 18-20%, and a drop in success to below 65%) and a range of error codes from ICICI, including `422 Unprocessable Entity` (EKYC_INSUFFICIENT_DATA), undocumented codes like `EKYC_403_RISK_FLAG` and `KYC_VERIFY_FAILED_412`, and a business logic rejection `IC_KYC_403_RISK_PROFILE_MISMATCH`.\n*   **Multiple Hypotheses:** The suspected causes are diverse. One theory is that ICICI's risk engine applies a stricter validation layer requiring additional data fields like `source_of_funds` and `nature_of_business` which are not being sent (dfc9990e7f4e4eaf, 097cc0a6f16d4069). Another suggests a processing bottleneck or resource constraints on the bank's end for complex profiles (2d337b70f1a3428e). A third points to rate‑limiting (`429 Too Many Requests`) possibly due to a misconfigured IP whitelist for a new pod cluster (ce30ebb1691b4c1a).\n*   **Blockers:** These issues are a critical blocker for UAT and production deployment, creating a significant manual review backlog and jeopardizing compliance with RBI's T+1 reporting timeline. The issues are tracked across several JIRA tickets, including PAY-6672, PAY-7719, PAY-8535, PAY-5595, and PAY-3670.",

    "Agentic_answer": "Based on the context fragments and search results, here's the overall situation with KYC automation failures:## Multiple Interconnected IssuesThe KYC automation failures appear to involve **multiple distinct but related issues** rather than a single root cause. Here are the key findings:### 1. **Fraud Engine Timeout Issues**- The fraud engine is timing out when scoring high‑risk customer profiles - There's a direct correlation between these timeouts and KYC failure rate spikes - The issue is isolated to high‑risk customer segments ### 2. **External Partner Issues****NPCI Problems:**- NPCI's risk engine is misclassifying a subset of users - Recent changes to NPCI's validation logic are causing drops for specific user segments - NPCI has acknowledged problems on their end and is rolling back changes **ICICI Integration Issues:**- ICICI's fraud engine is flagging high‑risk customer segments, causing validation errors - Timeouts when hitting ICICI KYC verification endpoints for high‑risk profiles - Infrastructure not provisioned for enhanced payloads ### 3. **Data Validation Problems**- Data validation errors from the company's end for high‑risk customer segments - Suspected payload parsing issues where fraud engine sends data that external systems can't parse - Potential data schema mismatches post‑localization ### 4. **Consistent Pattern: High‑Risk Segments**All issues consistently affect **high‑risk customer segments**, suggesting this is the common thread across different failure modes .### 5. **Business Impact**These failures are blocking critical projects:- UPI LITE X offline payments launch - RBI Data Localization audit readiness - UPI AutoPay Mandate integration - UPI Credit Line integration ### 6. **Current Status**Multiple JIRA tickets are tracking different aspects (PAY-8054, PAY-4638, PAY-8543, PAY-6973, PAY-9493, etc.), and teams are coordinating with external partners for joint debugging sessions and fixes .The situation appears to be a complex mix of internal timeout issues, external partner problems, and data validation challenges, all converging around high‑risk customer processing.",

However, a later email from you (2d15e1f5dc8344a3) shows the problem persists, with a discrepancy of approximately 0.8% of volume from a specific window.\n\nYour leading hypothesis is that ICICI's backend systems are failing to correctly process or parse the new RBI-mandated metadata fields (like `purpose_code` and `remitter_info`) in the payload. This would explain why the initial API call returns a `200 OK` success response, but the transactions are silently dropped before being included in the final T+1 settlement file.

The issue has been escalated to ICICI's technical team, and multiple JIRA tickets have been created to track the problem (PAY-3500, PAY-8657, PAY-2620, and others) .## Leading Hypotheses for Root CauseThe engineering team has identified **two primary hypotheses** for the settlement mismatch:### 1. **File Format Changes (Confirmed)**ICICI made an **unannounced change to their settlement file format** for cross-border UPI transactions, which is causing the Euler reconciliation job to fail . This appears to be a confirmed root cause for at least part of the issue.### 2. **RBI Mandate Integration Issues**Multiple team members suspect the issue is tied to **new RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandate requirements**:- **Data Field Issues**: ICICI's ingestion logic may be failing on new data points added for the RBI mandate - **Risk-Flagged Transactions**: Transactions flagged by the fraud engine under new RBI rules (specifically those with risk code 463045) are showing as successful in payment gateway logs but missing from ICICI's settlement files - **Settlement Notification Gaps**: There's a hypothesis that settlement notifications to ICICI are being dropped for specific transaction types ## Impact and DependenciesThis issue is affecting multiple work streams, particularly work ID 6d94c88e-0f48-4920-955d-142392efc1b3, and is described as \"a key dependency for the RBI reporting mandate\" .

    "Answer": "According to the hotfix plan file (98521b0f0ea14eca), the root cause of the issue in JIRA PAY-4484 is that the `kyc-processor` service's default HTTP client timeout of 3000ms is insufficient for the extended processing time ICICI's CKYC API requires for PEP (Politically Exposed Persons) lookups, resulting in `504 Gateway Timeout` errors. The proposed hotfix is to increase the `httpClient.timeout` parameter to 15000ms within the service's Kubernetes ConfigMap.",

However, the search results reveal a consistent pattern of similar API timeout issues and their root causes across multiple JIRA tickets.From the available context, the technical patterns for API timeouts in the payment system show:**Common Root Cause:**OAuth token refresh failures on third‑party provider endpoints (NPCI, ICICI Bank, Flipkart) **Typical Hotfix Approach:**- Providers deploy fixes on their end with ETAs ranging from 30 minutes to 2 hours - Manual reconciliation scripts are run after fixes are deployed - Close monitoring of error rates and Grafana dashboards during resolution **Standard Resolution Process:**1. Escalation to third‑party technical teams with logs and unique IDs 2. JIRA ticket updates with provider communications 3. Manual intervention for affected transactions post‑fix Without access to the specific PAY-4484 ticket details, I cannot provide the exact technical root cause and hotfix for the CKYC API timeouts. To get this information, you would need to check the JIRA ticket directly or search for more specific documentation related to CKYC integration issues.",

The team has already \"pinged contacts at ICICI about this bottleneck and shared the logs\" 2. **Temporary Fix Implementation**: Building a temporary fix on their end to maintain compliance while ICICI resolves their system issues .

This is tracked in JIRA PAY-3820 (docId: 4180f2ce0ea44d2c) and also noted in load tests for the `staging-cbs-v2` environment where p99 latency hit 2.1s with a 4.5% error rate (JIRA PAY-9646, docId: 114124d7b8234371).\n2.  **KYC Automation Failures:** The NPCI `/kyc/v2/verify` endpoint is showing an 18% failure rate for high-risk merchants with `504 Gateway Timeout` errors. The p99 latency for these requests has spiked to ~2.5s. This is tracked in JIRA PAY-9976 (docId: ae04d7100af8449d). Another report mentions an 18.5% failure rate for the `/v2/customer/verify-kyc` endpoint with similar timeouts, tracked in PAY-6683 (docId: 466115f54acc4b2c).\n3.  **Real-Time Risk Scoring Engine Latency:** The `/v2/risk/evaluate` endpoint is experiencing sustained peaks over 850ms from a 120ms baseline, causing a transaction failure rate increase to 0.48%. This is tracked in JIRA PAY-1372 (docId: 5abdcde06dac4544).\n4.  **API Rate-Limiting:** During load tests, the `/api/v2/payment/process` endpoint is being throttled at 4,200 TPS, well below the required 7,000 TPS. This causes `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` errors and is tracked in JIRA PAY-6903 (docId: 213181e20d284d76).\n5.  **OAuth Token Refresh Failures:** Intermittent `401 Unauthorized` responses from the `/oauth/token` endpoint are causing a 4.5% spike in `504 Gateway Timeout` errors and p99 latency spikes to over 2.1s. This is tracked in JIRA PAY-3613 (docId: 73598133649b4471) and PAY-2614 (docId: 801803701a034adf).",

    },
    "Answer": "The common underlying cause for transaction reconciliation mismatches is a client-side timeout at the UPI gateway ('HyperUPI') while awaiting a final status callback from NPCI. This leads to Juspay's system marking transactions with an internal timeout error (e.g., 'T707 - Gateway Await Timeout' or 'DEEMED_SUCCESS'), while NPCI's ledger shows them as successful or failed, creating a discrepancy in the T+1 settlement files (docIds: 2d0996f5aeea40c9, bc8a0ed68edf4ce4, 482421dd3b78426e).\n\nThe proposed mitigation plan, detailed in the document for PAY-2523 (docId: bc8a0ed68edf4ce4), is to enhance the 'Recon-Saras' microservice. The plan involves:\n1.  Implementing an asynchronous, delayed status check mechanism for any transaction logged with the timeout error code 'T707'.\n2.  The service will trigger a 'ReqTxnConfirmation' API call to the NPCI UPI switch after a 60-minute cooling-off period.\n3.  The response from this call will be used to update the transaction's final state in the primary database (`pg-txn-primary`).\n4.  A new field, `final_status_source`, will be added to the transaction table to log whether the terminal state came from the initial callback or the delayed confirmation call, ensuring a clear and auditable trail for regulatory review.",

    "Agentic_answer": "Based on the context fragments and search results, I can identify the common underlying causes and proposed mitigation plans for the transaction reconciliation mismatches affecting the RBI audit:## Common Underlying CausesThe analysis reveals several interconnected causes for the reconciliation mismatches:1. **Core Banking System Migration Issues**: The primary technical cause appears to be performance bottlenecks and configuration issues from core banking system migrations . These bottlenecks are slowing down logging and creating gaps in transaction processing.2. **Payment Gateway Metadata Capture Problems**: The payment-gateway service is not correctly capturing metadata post-settlement . This is causing transaction data to be incomplete or incorrectly logged before it reaches the masking layer.3. **Data Localization Compliance Gaps**: Transaction data isn't being stored consistently within India data centers , which creates reconciliation failures when jobs can't access complete data sets.4. **NPCI Settlement File Issues**: Multiple instances show NPCI's fraud-engine incorrectly flagging transactions during batch runs , leading to discrepancies in settlement files.## Proposed Mitigation PlanThe team has outlined a comprehensive mitigation strategy to ensure an auditable trail for the RBI Data Localization Audit:### Immediate Actions:- **Isolate Root Causes**: Determine whether issues stem from payment-gateway problems or errors propagating from upstream systems like Euler - **Data Migration**: Complete migration of all transaction logs to India data centers and re-run reconciliation jobs - **Hotfix Deployment**: Implement patches to fix metadata logging before it hits the masking layer ### Audit Trail Requirements:- **Clean Data Trail**: Establish end-to-end data storage within India to prove compliance - **Query Documentation**: Confirm all reconciliation queries run exclusively on India-DC BigQuery instances - **Lifecycle Tracing**: Document full transaction lifecycles for flagged mismatches ### Evidence Collection:- **JIRA Tracking**: Multiple JIRA tickets (PAY-3540, PAY-9512, PAY-3776, etc.) are tracking specific issues and remediation steps - **Before/After Analysis**: Pull performance data showing latency impacts and recovery timelines from BigQuery [search results]- **Formal RCA Documentation**: Obtain root cause analyses from partners like ICICI and NPCI for audit trail purposes ### Compliance Verification:- **Data Integrity Proof**: Demonstrate that no data was accessed from outside India, even for debugging purposes - **Corrected Settlement Files**: Coordinate with NPCI to receive corrected settlement files and verify clean reconciliation - **Performance Monitoring**: Address p99 latency issues on payment-gateway during peak loads to prevent audit exposure [search results]The work is being tracked under multiple work IDs, primarily c543f75f-1993-4086-bc57-640bb7c26576 and 9f0e0b8d-2b97-486c-8d39-063920848af7, indicating this is a coordinated, organization-wide effort to ensure RBI audit readiness.",

Settlement and Reconciliation Issues - **Issue**: Settlement mismatches where final ACK isn't received from ICICI for certain transactions- **Details**: Batch IDs like 612194 and 217800 showing discrepancies- **Impact**: ICICI's reconciliation API is timing out, affecting payment gateway operations- **JIRA**: PAY-8986, PAY-8851## 3. Real-time Data Delivery Limitations - **Issue**: ICICI cannot provide real-time data streams as requested- **Alternative**: Batched file delivery via SFTP instead- **Impact**: Creates problems for PCI audit compliance (Ref ID: 334508) as fraud engine needs near-instant data- **Solution**: Need to build a new service to poll SFTP and ingest data, adding latency- **JIRA**: PAY-4148## 4. Cross-border Payment Routing Problems - **Issue**: Routing configuration problems affecting cross-border payments- **Details**: Bad routing config in payment gateway causing transactions to fail to reach correct BIN- **Error**: Grafana logs showing error code 815299- **Root Cause**: ICICI's endpoint mapping doesn't match specification documents- **JIRA**: PAY-2868, PAY-4572, PAY-7015## 5. Multi-currency Settlement Challenges - **Issue**: ICICI's settlement file format lacks fields to differentiate currencies- **Impact**: Complicates reconciliation logic in payment gateway- **Workaround**: Using batch IDs (like batch #929520) but considered brittle- **Recommendation**: Push for API-based solution instead of complex parser- **JIRA**: PAY-9858, PAY-7594All these issues are related to the **UPI AutoPay Mandate Integration** project (work ID: a911cc73-2f3d-4a1d-aa90-31a1e0376001) and RBI mandate compliance requirements.",

This could delay the Attestation of Compliance and jeopardize the Q4 launch commitment with ICICI Bank.\n2.  **Severe Performance Issues:** Following ICICI's Core Banking System (CBS) migration, the p99 latency for authorization has degraded to untenable levels (1.9s - 2.6s), with failure rates jumping to 4.8%. This is a major blocker for UAT and does not meet NPCI certification requirements (email `3a061e71a10443a0`).\n3.  **Financial & Reconciliation Integrity:** There are recurring T+1 settlement discrepancies, with one instance amounting to INR 4.2 Lakhs. This creates a direct financial liability and poses a compliance risk against RBI's settlement timelines (file `6b5d116a0a2a4d93`, email `468a30a1964f41f7`).\n4.  **API Instability and Scalability:** The integration is hampered by API rate-limiting at levels far below projected volumes (throttled at 500 TPS vs. 1200 TPS need) and intermittent OAuth token refresh failures, which block testing and threaten production stability (emails `ee4b4e7e260e4c34`, `b96f0c30f5c342f6`).",

Regulatory Compliance Violations****Risk Level: Critical** - Potential violations of NPCI guidelines due to incorrect routing - Risk of breaching agreements with ICICI Bank - Strict TATs (Turnaround Times) that must be met per ICICI specifications - Need for thorough documentation and audit trails for compliance ## **3. Performance and Latency Issues****Risk Level: High**- Latency spikes in the risk scoring engine affecting user experience - Risk of timeouts that could \"hurt the user journey\" that ICICI is focused on - Real-time risk scoring engine performance issues (ref 766076) - If latency stays high, could breach compliance requirements ## **4. KYC Automation Failures****Risk Level: High**- High false positives in fraud detection affecting user experience - KYC automation failing specifically for \"high-risk customer segments\" - Drop-off rates concerning ICICI and impacting launch timelines - Generic failure responses instead of specific risk codes making debugging difficult ## **5. Partnership and Business Relationship Risks****Risk Level: Medium-High**- Need to \"keep the partnership warm\" with ICICI Bank - ICICI team \"getting antsy about the user impact\" - NPCI asking for updated timelines - Multiple EOD deadlines for providing updates to maintain relationships ## **6. Technical Integration Challenges****Risk Level: Medium**- API handshake issues between systems - Need for joint debugging sessions with ICICI - Fraud engine potentially being \"too aggressive\" - Configuration errors impacting transaction processing All of these risks are tied to work ID `a7a3beda-49c2-4e7d-80d0-51d413fa4b41` and are actively being tracked through various JIRA tickets (PAY-7974, PAY-8709, PAY-2419, PAY-4530, PAY-6385, etc.) .

    "Answer": "The recurring settlement mismatch problem involves transactions that are marked as 'SUCCESS' in Juspay's system but are subsequently absent from ICICI's T+1 settlement file. This creates financial discrepancies and audit trail issues.\n\n**Identified Root Causes:**\n1.  **Race Condition:** The primary cause appears to be a race condition where ICICI's system sends a success confirmation to Juspay before receiving a definitive success state from the NPCI switch. ICICI may later receive a timeout or failure from NPCI, but Juspay has already recorded the transaction as successful (file `6b5d116a0a2a4d93`).\n2.  **Reconciliation Logic:** Juspay's own reconciliation service was prematurely marking timed-out transactions as 'SUCCESS' based on a subsequent status query, while ICICI's final report listed them as 'RECON_FAIL' (email `ba845204e48647c6`).\n3.  **Webhook Anomaly:** There is a hypothesis of a failure in the asynchronous settlement confirmation webhook from ICICI's systems, as no corresponding hits were seen on Juspay's listener endpoint for the missing transactions (email `468a30a1964f41f7`).\n\n**Proposed Solutions:**\n1.  **Short-term:** An immediate containment measure has been deployed to the `Recon-Engine` to introduce a 'PENDING_RECON' state for such transactions, preventing them from being included in merchant settlements until their status is confirmed (file `6b5d116a0a2a4d93`).\n2.  **Long-term:** The long-term recommendation is to mandate that ICICI Bank exposes a real-time Transaction Query API. This would allow Juspay's system to proactively poll for the definitive NPCI status of transactions stuck in the 'PENDING_RECON' state (file `6b5d116a0a2a4d93`).",

ICICI Bank has also confirmed they \"can't support real-time FX conversion rates in the main settlement file\" and are proposing a separate EOD batch process instead . This creates additional reconciliation challenges that may conflict with RBI's strict compliance requirements.The team appears to be exploring workarounds and seeking alternatives to address these infrastructure limitations while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.",

    "Answer": "Several distinct API performance issues have been reported:\n1.  **Partner CBS Bottleneck:** The `/v2/upi/processOfflineTxn` endpoint latency spiked to over 2200ms (vs 500ms SLA), causing a ~3.5% timeout error rate due to a partner bank's CBS migration (docId: 1445597a25d64715). A related issue on the `/payment/initiate` endpoint showed latency spiking to over 1.9s with HTTP 504 errors (docId: 40ece7b334254f68).\n2.  **OAuth Token Refresh Failures:** The `/v2/oauth/token` endpoint has been returning `invalid_grant` errors and HTTP 504 Gateway Timeouts, causing p99 latency to spike to over 2200ms and the error rate to increase to ~4.8% (docId: 15dc25948ac24ecb). Another incident reported HTTP 401 Unauthorized errors on the `/token` endpoint, leading to a 4.5% failure rate (docId: 2c356cda1d554237).\n3.  **API Rate Limiting:** The `/v2/payments/offline/process` endpoint was being throttled by NPCI at 150 TPS, causing HTTP 429 'Too Many Requests' errors and an 18% failure rate during load tests (docId: f69c6db2e83a4f78). A separate incident on the `/v2/pay/initiate` endpoint showed a hard cap at ~500 TPS, receiving a `RATELIMIT_EXCEEDED` error code (docId: c123595d58aa460f).\n4.  **Risk Scoring Engine Latency:** The risk scoring API endpoint latency spiked from ~120ms to over 850ms, causing a 1.2% increase in `T504` transaction timeouts. This was hypothesized to be due to an auth service caching issue (docId: 089d64043cac4067).

Specifically:- The payment-gateway was **mis-routing transactions with international MCCs (such as test MCC 763411) to ICICI's domestic endpoint** instead of the correct cross-border endpoint - This routing misconfiguration prevented international transactions from being processed through the appropriate cross-border payment rails - The fraud-engine was correctly identifying the transactions, but they were not being routed to the right BIN (Bank Identification Number) ## Impact on Error RateThe routing misconfiguration had significant impact on error rates:- **Grafana logs showed they were \"full of error code 815299\"** related to the cross-border payment failures - The error rate was **\"ticking up\"** for the affected transaction flows - There was a **\"huge spike in 429 errors\"** and corresponding **\"processing dips\"** in transaction throughput - The team was monitoring the **\"payment-gateway error rate in Grafana\"** to track the impact ## Resolution ActionsThe engineering team took several steps to address the issue:- Logged technical details in JIRA PAY-7476 and PAY-7015 - Pushed a hotfix for the routing rules - Coordinated with ICICI's tech team to verify endpoint mapping discrepancies - This was part of the UPI Credit Line integration work and RBI mandate project The issue was particularly critical as it was blocking ICICI's UAT (User Acceptance Testing) process and affecting compliance with RBI Enhanced Transaction Monitoring mandates .",

    "Agentic_answer": "Based on the Slack messages from the #engineering channel, here's the latest on the OAuth problems:## Current StatusThe **NPCI OAuth token refresh failure** has become a **firm blocker** for the RBI Data Localization Audit Readiness program . This issue is causing consistent API timeouts on the Euler gateway for NPCI's specific endpoints .## Key Details:- **Problem**: OAuth token refresh failures causing API timeouts with NPCI- **Impact**: Critical blocker for RBI Data Localization audit readiness and UPI LITE X timeline- **Evidence**: Transaction with unique ID 859674 shows consistent timeouts in Grafana ## Escalation and Incident IDs:1. **Siddharth Nair** escalated this with NPCI and tagged it against their **incident ID 681162** 2. **Rohit Sharma** mentioned using **incident ID 821267** for internal communication 3. NPCI is also tracking this on their side with **ID #262596** 4. Another NPCI tracking ID mentioned is **610945** 5. Additional incident ID **986135** is being tracked in JIRA PAY-7606 ## Current Actions:- NPCI's team has acknowledged the issue but is requesting more verbose logs - Multiple JIRA tickets created (PAY-7587, PAY-2405, PAY-3397, etc.)- Joint call with NPCI engineers was scheduled to resolve the correlation issues - Root cause analysis (RCA) initiated to document impact for compliance The issue appears to be actively managed by **Siddharth Nair** and **Rohit Sharma** who are coordinating directly with NPCI, while **Priya Nair** is handling the compliance and audit readiness aspects.",

      "SemanticSimilarity": 8,
      "Completeness": 8,
      "Reason": "DomainRelevance scored 10 because the answer stays fully on the OAuth issue. Factuality scored 6 as it correctly names Siddharth Nair and incident ID 681162 but cites an incorrect JIRA ID and adds unrelated incident numbers. SemanticSimilarity scored 8 since the overall meaning matches the ground truth with extra details, and Completeness scored 8 because it covers the main points while providing additional, non‑essential information.",
      "Insights": "MISSING TRUTH: The ground truth specifies the internal tracking JIRA as PAY-8379, which the agentic answer does not mention. CONTRADICTIONS: The answer lists JIRA PAY-7606 and other IDs, conflicting with the correct JIRA number. DEVIATIONS: Adds several extra incident IDs (821267, #262596, 610945, 986135) and mentions additional stakeholders (Rohit Sharma, Priya Nair) not present in the ground truth. ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: Provides broader context about audit readiness, Euler gateway timeouts, and multiple JIRA tickets, which, while informative, are not required. OVERALL ASSESSMENT: The response accurately captures the core facts (OAuth failure, escalator, incident ID) but introduces inaccurate JIRA tracking information and extraneous details, lowering factual accuracy slightly."
